But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, 29524 * 3. Let me do it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, perhaps. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). But in this case, it's more nested. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I let L_k represent the k-th layer, then L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, starting from L_1=4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence would be L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_k^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier, so that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here, maybe a geometric series or something similar, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can simplify the computation, especially if there were more layers. But even without that, computing each layer step by step works fine, especially since there are only nine layers.\n\nWait, let me check again the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost, then each time it's 1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3. So, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3(1+, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. From the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, how many layers? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is once, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3(1+3(...\n- Then another (1+3(...\n- And so on.\n\nEach (1+3( adds another layer. So, how many times does (1+3( appear? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then (1+3(...\n3. Then another (1+3(...\n4. And so on until the last (1+3(...\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(1+3(, each subsequent ( is part of another layer. Let me count the number of (1+3( sequences:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1+3. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct because that's the innermost part. Then multiplying by 3 gives the total. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as per the recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5.

Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0.

Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 29524 *3. As computed earlier, that's 88572. So, all steps check out.

Let me check 29524*3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if that's the case. a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, which matches. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. So, for the innermost layer, which is layer 1, a1=4. Then, each subsequent layer up to layer 9 would be a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3, so perhaps expanding the entire expression would give a geometric series. Let me try that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)). Let me see how many terms there are. Since it's 9 layers deep, each with a 3 multiplication, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, expanding E would give: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) ) Let me try to expand this step by step, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then E = 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. If I expand E, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, let me think. Each time you go a layer out, you multiply by another 3. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is 4, then each layer adds another 3* that value. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))...). Let me see: E = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, because each layer adds one more 3. Let me count the number of terms. The innermost is 1+3, which is 4, then each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 3^1, then next layer is 3^2, up to 3^9, and then multiplied by 3 again. Wait, let's see: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 3*(3 +1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3^2 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^3 + 3^2. Wait, this seems like each layer adds a new power of 3. So, expanding all the way, E would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to expand it step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) )\n\nLet me compute the innermost first:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that could be represented as a geometric series or something? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which might lead to a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up to a geometric series, but the step-by-step computation worked well enough. It's also good to verify using a different method, like the recurrence relation, to ensure that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and use it to compute the next, continuing until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2 with a carryover of 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, 5 with a carryover of 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8 with a carryover of 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6.

Wait, that's 688572? No, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me count the digits in 29524: 2 (1), 9 (2), 5 (3), 2 (4), 4 (5). So, 5 digits. Multiplying by 3, which is a single digit, so the result should be 5 or 6 digits. Let's compute it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8, 6.

Wait, no, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did it right. Each layer is correctly computed, and the final multiplication gives 88572. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious if there are many layers. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, maybe using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince the outermost layer is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which is especially useful if there are many layers, as it can save a lot of time.\n\nBut in this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but using the formula is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem can be solved either by iteratively computing each layer from the inside out or by recognizing the pattern and using the derived formula for the nth layer. Both methods lead to the same result.\n\nI think I've got it. The final answer is 88572. I'll double-check just to be sure.\n\nYes, using the formula: 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYep, that's correct. So, the computation is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a derived formula, we find that each layer n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 =13, then 1 + 3*13=40, etc. It seems like each term is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nActually, this looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. So, perhaps the general formula for such a nested expression with n layers is (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let me compute that manually:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nIf I use the formula (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which doesn't match 40. Hmm, maybe that's not the right formula.\n\nWait, perhaps it's (3^{n} - 1)/2, but starting from n=1: Let's see:\n\nIf n=1: 1 + 3 =4, which would be (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3*4=13. Using the formula: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))=1 + 3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1+3)))=1 +3*40=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the pattern is that for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then each layer wraps around that, so each time we add a layer, it's another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, according to the formula, each layer n corresponds to (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, but in the earlier examples, when I had 3 layers, it was (3^4 -1)/2=40, which matched. So, for 9 layers, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=9 layers, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches Layer9 as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572, which is what I got before.\n\nSo, using the formula, the value is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, the expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having 9 terms. But perhaps that's more complicated than necessary.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500. 88,500 + 60 is 88,560. 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute one of the layers again to check for consistency. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 +1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Add 1: 29,523 +1 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 29,524 * 3: As before, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, all layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, 88572.

Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total is 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total is 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0; total is 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; total is 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. So, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step might be more straightforward. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me time. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see what the general formula for a_n is. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers. Let me confirm: Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. Layer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches. Layer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, indeed, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the general formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Let me compute 3 * 29,000 first, which is 87,000. Then, 3 * 524 = 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the total should be 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be more efficient and less error-prone, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I know that such recursions can often be solved using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each a_n is growing exponentially, which makes sense because the recurrence has a multiplicative factor of 3 each time. To find a closed-form solution, let's consider the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n9/2 = 3C\nDivide both sides by 3:\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I got 88,572, which is correct. So, using the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that the expression is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. So, if I let x be the innermost expression, say x = 1 + 3, then the next layer would be 1 + 3x, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on. But I think the approach I took with the recurrence relation is more straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form solution, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result. It's reassuring to see that regardless of the approach, the answer is consistent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check the multiplication step again: 3 * 29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer's value and then combine them to find the final result. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form `1 + 3*(previous layer)`. There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost `1 + 3` and building outward.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** `1 + 3 = 4`\n   - **Layer 2:** `1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13`\n   - **Layer 3:** `1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40`\n   - **Layer 4:** `1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121`\n   - **Layer 5:** `1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364`\n   - **Layer 6:** `1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093`\n   - **Layer 7:** `1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280`\n   - **Layer 8:** `1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841`\n   - **Layer 9:** `1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524`\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   The entire expression is `3` multiplied by Layer 9's result.\n   - `3 * 29524 = 88572`\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution:\n   - `a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2`\n   - For `n = 9`, `a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524`\n   - Multiplying by 3 gives the final result: `3 * 29524 = 88572`\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Maybe I should go back and check each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors. Let's start over and compute each layer carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 +3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation faster, especially if there are more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step isn't too bad. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nL_n = (L_1 - b/(1 - a)) * a^{n - 1} + b/(1 - a)\n\nWait, let me check that. The standard solution for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is:\n\nIf a \u2260 1, then L_n = a^{n - 1}*(L_1 - b/(1 - a)) + b/(1 - a).\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's derive it.\n\nWe have L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b.\n\nWe can write this as L_n - a*L_{n-1} = b.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - a*L_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^{n}.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a).\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*a^{n} + b/(1 - a).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*a^{1} + b/(1 - a) => 4 = C*a + b/(1 - a).\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = (4 - b/(1 - a)) / a.\n\nSubstituting a = 3, b = 1:\n\nC = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) / 3 = (4 - 1/(-2)) / 3 = (4 + 1/2) / 3 = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n + 1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n + 1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, Layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it more quickly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is especially useful if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3 is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(L_n\\) where \\(L_1 = 1 + 3\\), and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1}\\).\n\n1.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, I wonder if there's a pattern or a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, we can solve it iteratively.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me just confirm that 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10} -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of layers again to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and there are nine such layers. So when I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, that's correct. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's compute L_2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches L_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L_2=13.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have nine layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88,572, which is the same as 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, which is 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88,572 as the answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...).

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, I think the answer is correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as computed before. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is a function of the previous term. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads to the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a linear recurrence. But either way, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. Correct) Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute this again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: Break it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the original expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, each subsequent one is another layer. Let's see: After the first 3(, there's 1+3(...). Then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on until the ninth one. Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me recount. Let's consider each \"1+3(\" as a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3(, there's a 1+3(, which is Layer 9, then inside that, another 1+3(, which is Layer 8, and so on until Layer 1. So, perhaps when I computed up to Layer 9, that's actually the innermost layer, and then each subsequent layer is built outward. Wait, no, perhaps I have it reversed. Let me think again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, the last 1+3 is Layer 1. Then moving outward, each \"1+3(...)\" is a higher layer. So, perhaps when I computed up to Layer 9, that's actually the outermost layer, which would be the first one after the initial 3. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me write it with indices to clarify:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\n...\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, each Ei is defined based on E(i-1). So, starting from E1, we compute up to E9, then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, in that case, my earlier computation was correct: E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524. Then, 3*E9=88,572.\n\nBut let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first one after 3(, that's the first layer, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(. Therefore, there are 9 layers, each defined as E1 to E9 as above. Therefore, computing up to E9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me just think about this for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric series or something. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me recall that. If I have a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can get a closed-form expression, which might have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches what I computed earlier. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms each step. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me go back and verify each layer's computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps check out. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 29524, so yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see: Let\u2019s assume a particular solution is a constant, so a_n = k. Then, substituting into the recurrence: k = 1 + 3k => k - 3k = 1 => -2k =1 => k = -1/2. Hmm, that seems odd because our terms are all positive and increasing. Maybe that approach isn't the best here. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, perhaps we can express it as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that each layer is built as follows:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. Each a_n seems to be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Let me check that.\n\nFor a_1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 = 4.\n\na_2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 13.\n\na_3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each a_n is the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 up to 3^n. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that. For a_1, n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. Since there are nine layers, the outermost layer would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me confirm: since each layer corresponds to n=1 up to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which might be more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut since in this problem there are only nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable, but for more layers, the formula would be more efficient.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

It's similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Specifically, each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Hmm, actually, a_1 is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I computed. So, in general, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Let me assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me check 3^10. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 minus 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 times 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Let me break that down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, multiplying each digit by 3 from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So yes, 88,572. Wait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 88,572, but when I wrote it out step by step, I thought it was 88,572. Wait, but in my first digit-by-digit approach, I wrote 88572, which is 88,572, so that's correct. Wait, but when I broke it down, I thought it was 88,572, which is the same as 88572. So the final answer would be 88,572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer, perhaps this forms a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recursion: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make any calculation errors when I multiplied 29524 by 3. Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 +12\n\n= 60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers, let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n\n2. 1+3*4=13\n\n3.1+3*13=40\n\n4.1+3*40=121\n\n5.1+3*121=364\n\n6.1+3*364=1093\n\n7.1+3*1093=3280\n\n8.1+3*3280=9841\n\n9.1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

    "text": " 3 * 29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, so 2 with a carryover of 7. 52 * 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163, so 3 with a carryover of 16. 95 * 3 = 285, plus 16 is 301, so 1 with a carryover of 30. 29 * 3 = 87, plus 30 is 117, so 7 with a carryover of 11. Finally, the initial 2 * 3 = 6, plus 11 is 17. So writing it down: 17, then 7, then 1, then 3, then 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29,524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should give a 6-digit number. Let me try another approach: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 *3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000. 87,000 +1,500=88,500. 88,500 +60=88,560. 88,560 +12=88,572. Okay, that matches my earlier result. So 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Suppose I define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. Wait, no, because a_1 would be the innermost layer, which is 1 +3=4. Then a_2=1 +3*a_1=1+12=13, which matches what I did earlier. So, in general, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, after 9 layers, a_9 would be the value, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p =1 +3*a_p => a_p -3a_p=1 => -2a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me verify my computations for each layer again because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might have made an error. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me find B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I saw the layers, each step was 3 times the previous plus 1, which is similar to a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. So maybe there's a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1} for k > 1. So, for each layer, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a solution to a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So when k=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. So that's another way to get the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers.

Hmm, that's a pretty big number, but given the number of layers, it makes sense. Each layer is tripling the previous value and adding 1, so it's growing exponentially. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something. But since each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where L_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, we arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the iterative method. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the value of the previous layer, leading to an exponential growth pattern. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the nth layer, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
