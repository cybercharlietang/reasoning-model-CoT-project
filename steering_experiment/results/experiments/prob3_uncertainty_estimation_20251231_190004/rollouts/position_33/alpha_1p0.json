    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So the total is 88,572. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check one of the layers again. Let's take Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. And Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000=87000, 87000 + 1500=88500, 88500 +72=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 more efficiently. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3*C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a general formula, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount when there are so many. Let's see, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). How many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3 is a new layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 (Layer 1), then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3, so how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 before the first closing parenthesis. Let me parse it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1+3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's see, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of 1 + 3 expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, ending up with Layer 9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations again because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. So, 9 layers in total. Therefore, my calculation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about it.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstitute a_n = A*3^{n} + B:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, it would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with the formula. So, the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 59048/2 = 29524, correct. So, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nThis seems consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3: Let me compute this again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 * 3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That also checks out.\n\nSo, I think I've got it right. The answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing the layers again using the formula to see if each layer matches my previous step-by-step calculations.\n\nUsing the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLayer 1: n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nLooking at the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3 and n terms. But in this case, since it's a finite number of terms, the sum can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2, which is consistent with the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so S=(3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the first term is 1, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3. So, for n layers, the sum would be (3^{n} -1)/2, but in our case, each layer adds another term, so perhaps the formula applies directly.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, solving it as a geometric series gives us the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or model it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer.

(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, each time we add a layer, the depth increases by one. So, the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent is layer 2, etc., up to layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation of 88572 seems correct. But let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is a_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13.\n\na_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2,\n\nwith a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B,\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.

Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure. Let me compute each layer again using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280.

Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I can confidently say the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. The final value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, which, when multiplied by 3, gives 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result would be 88,572. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a geometric progression. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since it's nested, maybe using recursion would be a better approach. Let me see if I can model this with a recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That seems correct. Let me compute each a_n using this formula:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the recursive formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve this using a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence relation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Let's solve for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So, the closed-form formula confirms that a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 is indeed (59049)/2 - 1/2 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: Starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe expanding this would result in a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding a few layers to see if that's possible.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, which is 40. Hmm, so each layer adds another term of 3^k. Let me see if that's a pattern.\n\nWait, Layer 1: 1 + 3^1 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, that's not exactly matching. Because in Layer 2, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, but 1 + 3 + 9 is 13 as well. Similarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, each layer is a sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} where n is the layer number. Wait, but in Layer 3, it's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, which is the sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k, which is (3^4 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. So, that's correct. So, each layer a_n is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: sum is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: sum is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is what we had earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to look at it, using the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's 3 times a_n where a_n is the sum up to layer 9. So, 3*a_9 is indeed the total. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula that allows me to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. For example, if there were 100 layers, it would be impractical to compute each one manually. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, each layer a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is the same as the recursive formula we had earlier. Solving this recurrence relation gives us a closed-form solution, which we did, so we can compute a_9 directly using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, but in the initial problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, does that mean that the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the sum up to the ninth layer? Yes, that's correct. So, that's why we multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step. 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me check that:\n\n30000 * 3 = 90000.\n\n476 * 3 = 1428.\n\nSo, 29524 = 30000 - 476.\n\nTherefore, 29524 * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that works too.\n\nSo, after all these checks, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n3. Notice a pattern that each layer follows a recurrence relation, which can be modeled as a geometric series.\n\n4. Derive a closed-form formula using the sum of a geometric series to compute the innermost layers more efficiently.\n\n5. Confirm the result by computing each layer manually and then using the closed-form formula.\n\n6. Finally, multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression and verify the multiplication.\n\nThis thorough approach helps ensure that I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to get lost in the layers and miscompute a value, but by checking each step and using different methods (recursive computation and closed-form formula), I can be confident in the answer.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a general formula for such expressions. For example, if I have an expression with n layers of 1 + 3*(...), what would be the value? In this case, we saw that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, if I have k layers, the value inside would be a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, and then the entire expression would be 3*a_k = 3*(3^{k+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{k+2} - 3)/2. Let me check that with our problem. Here, k=9, so the expression would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's exactly what we got earlier. So, that's another way to express the total result without computing each layer.\n\nSo, the general formula for the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers is (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. In our case, n=9, so (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. That's a neat formula and shows how powerful recognizing patterns and using geometric series can be in solving such problems.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the number of layers. In our problem, the innermost parentheses is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Therefore, n=9. So, using the general formula, it's (3^{9+2} - 3)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is correct.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11} just to be thorough. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, yes, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, that's consistent.\n\nSo, in summary, by recognizing the pattern, using recursion, deriving a closed-form formula, and verifying each step, I arrived at the solution 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all the methods point to the same answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when numbers get big, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" parts: Starting from the first one after the initial 3(, that's one, then each subsequent one adds another. So, how many? Let's see: 1. 1 + 3(...) 2. 1 + 3(...) 3. 1 + 3(...) 4. 1 + 3(...) 5. 1 + 3(...) 6. 1 + 3(...) 7. 1 + 3(...) 8. 1 + 3(...) 9. 1 + 3(...) So, nine layers in total. So, my earlier calculation of nine layers is correct. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88,572. Wait a moment, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 in another way to verify. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Let me do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, starting from L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, etc., which is exactly what I computed. So, the recurrence is correct. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. And the recurrence relation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I computed Layer 9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, that was the value inside the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches the earlier result. So, that's another way to see it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for each layer and compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me check: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), so Layer 9 is 29524, so the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break that down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. Wait, that might be confusing. Maybe I should do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Finally, 9*3=27. So putting it all together: 88572? Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write 7 and carryover 2, but since there are no more digits, write 27. Wait, that would make the number 278572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me confirm using a calculator method: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the total is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me check my earlier steps because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1 + 3( inside the expression. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, that's nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each layer from 1 to 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the innermost part, right? So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. But wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the computation of each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the innermost Layer 1 is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 3*(Layer 9) is the outermost operation. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, which we computed as 88572. So, that should be the final answer. But just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually to check.\n\nLet me compute Layer 1 through Layer 3 again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I look at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the inside, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be expressed in terms of a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1, b=3.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is L_n = (a/(1 - b)) + (b^n)*C, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, b=3, which is greater than 1, so the formula might be a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, the solution can be expressed as L_n = (a*(b^n - 1))/(b - 1) + initial condition.\n\nWait, let me think. For a recurrence relation like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = a + b*L_0, where L_0 is some initial value.\n\nIn our case, L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, since the innermost layer is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each subsequent L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, in this case, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nTo find A and B, we can plug in the initial condition.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe also know that the homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nComparing both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition at n=1: L_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit is 2*3=6, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are:\n\n2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, 2*3=6, but since there's no carryover beyond that, it's just 6.\n\nWait, but when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I missed the digit. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2*3 +2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). So, the result is 88572. Wait, that's 5 digits: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

Hmm, let's do that multiplication step by step to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. But wait, let me count the number of layers again to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the first 3, there are 9 layers inside, right? Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3( ... )) 2. 3(1+3( ... )) 3. 3(1+3( ... )) 4. 3(1+3( ... )) 5. 3(1+3( ... )) 6. 3(1+3( ... )) 7. 3(1+3( ... )) 8. 3(1+3( ... )) 9. 3(1+3) So, yes, 9 layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Solving such a recurrence might give a formula, which could be faster, especially for more layers. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27.

Wait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524*3: Let me check with another method. 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000=88048; 88048 + 524=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them step by step. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because when I see the number of layers, it's nine layers deep, and each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a1=4; n=2, a2=13; n=3, a3=40; and so on, up to n=9, a9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final answer is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Breaking it down:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nThe last digit is 2*3=6.\n\nWait, wait, hold on.

So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier because when I did 29524*3, I might have miscounted the digits. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, when I multiplied 3*29524, I got 88572, but when I think about the layers, starting from 1+3 and going up, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently instead of calculating each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, the closed-form approach seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually was manageable, albeit time-consuming.\n\nI think I've got it right. Let me just recap:\n\n- Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\n- The closed-form solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\n- For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\n- The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. The solution involves calculating each nested layer step by step, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: Each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Closed-form solution**: The general formula for the nth layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the ninth layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again. Let's go up to Layer 3: Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Layer 4: 121. 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Layer 5:364. 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Layer 6:1093. 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Layer7:3280. 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Layer8:9841. 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Layer9:29524. 3*29524=88572. Yep, all the layers add up correctly. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 again. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the inside out: 1+3, then 1+3( that result), and so on. Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 (Layer 1) Then each next layer adds another 1+3(...), so Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1+3*(Layer 2), etc. Since the expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3, that means there are nine layers, so Layer 1 to Layer 9. Therefore, my earlier calculation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, 88572 is the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. But just to make sure, let me compute each step using the formula to see if I can find a pattern or a way to compute it more efficiently. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step, but it's going to get complicated. Alternatively, since I know that each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and there are 9 layers, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, I think that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9). Let me check that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, it's 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which I just computed as 29524. So, the final step would be to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of '1 + 3(' sequences. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 1. (1+3(...))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3))))) \n\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The first layer is 1 + 3(...\n- Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...\n- And so on until we get to the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nLet me count the number of '1 + 3(' instances. Starting from the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...\n3. 1 + 3(...\n4. 1 + 3(...\n5. 1 + 3(...\n6. 1 + 3(...\n7. 1 + 3(...\n8. 1 + 3(...\n9. 1 + 3(...\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? Because each time you go in, you add another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my earlier calculation was correct, with 9 layers leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the initial 3 times. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again. 3*29524. Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 (from 29) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572, which seems correct. So, perhaps my initial calculation is right.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using the formula. The expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the layers. Let me compute each layer using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLayer 1: n=1 \u2192 (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\nLayer 2: n=2 \u2192 (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\nLayer 3: n=3 \u2192 (81-1)/2=40. Correct.\nLayer 4: n=4 \u2192 (243-1)/2=121. Correct.\nLayer 5: n=5 \u2192 (729-1)/2=364. Correct.\nLayer 6: n=6 \u2192 (2187-1)/2=1093. Correct.\nLayer 7: n=7 \u2192 (6561-1)/2=3280. Correct.\nLayer 8: n=8 \u2192 (19683-1)/2=9841. Correct.\nLayer 9: n=9 \u2192 (59049-1)/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out with the formula. Therefore, the final computation is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Let me do this step by step: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total would be 88572.

That seems right. Let me verify with another approach to be sure. Another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, n1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then n2 = 1 + 3n1 = 1 + 12 = 13. n3 = 1 + 3n2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, as I did before. So, that method checks out. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number, then a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_i. Let's see. The recurrence is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_i = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For i=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For i=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For i=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For i=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer i, a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses starting from the innermost. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each additional layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds one more. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, the first is Layer 1, then each time you go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), right? Because each time you have 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, Layer 9 is a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the inside: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me verify each multiplication to be sure. For example, 3 * 4 = 12, yes. 3 * 13 = 39, yes. 3 * 40 = 120, yes. 3 * 121 = 363, yes. 3 * 364: 364 * 3, let's compute 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Correct. 3 * 1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Correct. 3 * 3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; 9000 + 840 = 9840. Correct. 3 * 9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Correct. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's right, but let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result would be 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I've solved the problem correctly by computing each layer step by step and then verifying it using a recurrence relation approach. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try a different approach to see if I can confirm the result another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 manually to confirm. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 29524*3: Let's compute 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So, yes, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014both led me to the same answer.

So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and working outwards nine times. So, maybe my layers are correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function a(n) where n is the number of layers, starting from 1. So, a(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1)\n\nSo, a(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a(9). Then, the total expression is 3*a(9).

So, unless I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere, the answer should be 88572.

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it might form a geometric progression. Let me explore that.\n\nIf I let a(n) be the value at each layer, then a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a(n) = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set a(n) = D = 1 + 3*D \u21d2 D - 3D = 1 \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a(9) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly accounted for the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each adding a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, up to layer 9. So, n=9, and a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*a(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, and it still gives me 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is 1+3(...\n\nThen, each time, we have another 1+3(...\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. ...1+3(...\n\n3. ...1+3(...\n\n4. ...1+3(...\n\n5. ...1+3(...\n\n6. ...1+3(...\n\n7. ...1+3(...\n\n8. ...1+3(...\n\n9. ...1+3(...\n\n10. ...1+3))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 instances of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous one. So, that would make 9 layers, right? So, the innermost is the 9th layer, and then each layer wraps around the previous one. So, in my earlier calculation, I correctly considered 9 layers, so a(9) is correct.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the first term is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the first layer is the innermost 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, 9 layers in total. So, my calculation of a(9) as (3^{10} -1)/2 is correct because n=9, so 3^{n+1}=3^{10}.\n\nTherefore, everything checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. So adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So the total would be 88,572. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 13. Layer 3: 40. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524: As before, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent. So I think I did that correctly. Let me try another approach just to double-check. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can express this as a recurrence. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence would be L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost 1+3, each time wrapping with another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers, which corresponds to n=9 in the formula. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524=88,572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to see if they match my earlier calculations. L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct. L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, yes, each layer matches the formula, so the final computation of 3*29524=88,572 should be correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By solving each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\). This recurrence can be solved using the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break that down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. But just to be thorough, let me see if I can find a pattern or formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step.\n\n1.

Let me count the number of layers again to make sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: After the first 3, there's (1+3(...)). Each time there's another (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first ( is the start of Layer 1: 1+3(...). \n   - Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time we have a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen moving out, each (1+3(...) is another layer.

So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13 (Layer 2)\n3.

But I'm a bit confused because when I count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections, it seems like there are eight of them after the initial 3.

Multiply each by 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence. First, let's substitute n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, we also know that a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides, we get B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 3A + B = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, right.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I computed up to Layer 9, which was 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I computed. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating step by step from the innermost layer outward, we determine the value of each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost layer. Multiplying this final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 5: 3*121=363 +1=364. Layer 6: 3*364=1,092 +1=1,093. Layer 7: 3*1,093=3,279 +1=3,280. Layer 8: 3*3,280=9,840 +1=9,841. Layer 9: 3*9,841=29,523 +1=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's see if that works. For n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. For n=2, a_2=13: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13. Now, subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Correct. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Then, 29,524*3. Let me compute that again: 29,524 *3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've got the correct answer here. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation.

So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to verify. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, and so on. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For Layer 1 (n=1): a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4 (n=4): (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, maybe computing each step is faster. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I double-checked each layer, and the recurrence formula also gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the final result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the outermost layer, which is layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

The outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572? Wait, that seems high. Let me verify each step again because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again carefully. 29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n3*3=9.\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that's 88572. Hmm, but when I did it earlier, I thought 3*29524 was 88572. Let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when you have nested expressions like this, there's a formula for it. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's try to find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, let me check: the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me check each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It's a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, right? Let me check: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280.

Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, by the time we get to Layer 9, that's the outermost one, which is multiplied by 3. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, let's see if there's a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more with the closed-form formula. The outermost layer is a_9, and then we multiply by 3. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, that's consistent. I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, that's 88,572, which is what I got earlier. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate a step. Let me recount the layers. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds one more 3*(...). The expression has nine sets of parentheses, so from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each one computed correctly. So each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might make it easier to compute for multiple layers without having to compute each one step by step. The standard approach for such linear recurrence relations is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. So, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, indeed, it's 88,572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's reassuring because both methods give the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.

Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279; so 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840; so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times this value, so 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72.

Maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we can write the recurrence relation as a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} - 3*a_n = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, let me compute a_9. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2,187; 3^8 = 6,561; 3^9 = 19,683; 3^10 = 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that makes sense. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by solving the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, let me do that step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, is the final answer 88572? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. But let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation. The general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might make it easier. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make any computational errors, let me verify 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let's compute that again. 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from the top, it's 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first term is 3(1+3(...)). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them: Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of parentheses. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think my calculation is correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final step is multiplying by 3. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. I think that's the correct answer.

Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just thought about whether I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original problem again. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, yes, nine layers in total, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, my initial calculation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using a formula, especially if they're finite. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, but that would be an infinite case, leading to x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -0.5, which doesn't make sense here because we're dealing with positive numbers. But in this case, it's finite, so each layer depends on the next one. So, perhaps there's a way to compute it using a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I compute a_9, then multiply by 3, that should give me the answer. Let me compute a_1 through a_9 again to make sure: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute a_n without having to compute each step manually. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, the answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3*29524 again. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.

Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It looks like each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me think about the general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), repeated n times. The value can be expressed using the formula for a geometric series. But in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Wait, actually, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is x_{k} = 1 + 3x_{k-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation might give me a closed-form expression, which could help verify the result without computing each layer step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is x_k = 1 + 3x_{k-1}, with x_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is x_k - 3x_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x^{(h)}_k = C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution x^{(p)}_k = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition x_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is x_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. So, x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For k=2: x_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. k=3: x_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I think my initial calculation was correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. x_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4\nx_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13\nx_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40\nx_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121\nx_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364\nx_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093\nx_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280\nx_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841\nx_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524\n\nYes, all these match the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be extra careful, let me compute 3*29524 manually to ensure that multiplication is correct.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nNo more digits, so write down the carry over 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, actually, let's write it properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows a geometric progression. Solving the recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which we apply to find the value of the innermost layer and work outward. Finally, multiplying by 3 yields the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, yes, after computing all the inner layers, the outermost operation is multiplying the entire expression inside by 3. So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me verify if I did each step correctly.

Hmm, that seems right, but let me check the arithmetic for each layer again to be sure. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, which is Layer 3, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each layer. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug in n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. But wait, let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentiation. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 step by step. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So, putting it all together: 278, then 8, 5,7,2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me do it properly. Let's write 29524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do that step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: Let me compute this again to be sure. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4 (from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4). This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. That makes me more confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another 3 times the next layer. If I expand this, it's similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^9, but I need to check that.\n\nWait, actually, when I expand the expression, each multiplication by 3 distributes over the addition. Let me try to write the entire expression expanded:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3 (nine times). Wait, but that might not be exactly correct because each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer, so when expanding, each term is 3^k *1, where k is the number of multiplications.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, when fully expanded, the expression inside the outermost parentheses would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nIf I expand this, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1. Wait, that would be a sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, because each layer adds another power of 3. But that sum would be (3^{10} - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is the same as L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that sum, so 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems to align with the earlier results. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is the sum of a geometric series with 10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9), which sums to (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer adds a term that's 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=9, the sum is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives the final result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each time we're adding another layer, it's like we're building a geometric progression. Each step, the value is multiplied by 3 and adds 1. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, which is exactly what we saw earlier.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression can be evaluated by recognizing the pattern, either by expanding each layer step by step, by solving the recurrence relation, or by recognizing the sum of a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing the nested structure and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})$, leading to a geometric series.\n\n2. **Compute the sum**: The innermost expression is $1 + 3 = 4$. Each subsequent layer adds another power of 3.

Let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, perhaps. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, L1 was 4, L2 was 13, L3=40, etc. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. Let's solve this recurrence. First, write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
