    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the whole nested parentheses. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 * 29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 differently. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up each part:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. Plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see.\n\nIf I let a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's try that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me clarify: the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer wraps around, so the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think I've thought through this thoroughly, checked my work both step by step and using a formula, and both methods agree. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 88572.

So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it without going through each layer step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, this confirms that the value is indeed 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and even verified the result using a different method, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good to go.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. By systematically solving each layer and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost value by 3, leading to the answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go back to Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364, correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. That seems right. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, so it's a geometric series. Let me try to see if I can find a pattern or a formula for L(n). Let's compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern: L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each time, it's tripling the previous term and adding 1. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Now, I can try to find a closed-form formula for L(n). Since it's a linear recurrence of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution is L(n) = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution, since b is a constant, can be found by assuming L_p(n) = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that: 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's if I break it down digit by digit. Alternatively, 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check for any possible miscalculations. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is built upon the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recursive formula here. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that directly: 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from the top: 88572. Correct.

By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. So, we have a recurrence relation here. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which would make it easier to compute the 9th layer without calculating each step manually. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is given by: a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n-1} Wait, actually, let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. Alternatively, since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, we can solve it by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c=1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution: a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 divided by 2 is 29524.5, and subtracting 0.5 gives 29524. Then, 3 times that is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can think about this expression as a geometric series. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, if I expand the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Expanding this, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1, but wait, that might not capture it correctly because each layer also adds a 1. Hmm, maybe not exactly a geometric series. Alternatively, considering the expression as a sum of powers of 3 minus some constants. Wait, but I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward. So, yeah, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3. So, let me compute that: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach time, I think I have nine layers because each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). Let me count the number of times I have \"1+3(\" in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences. Each opening parenthesis after the first one adds another layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write it out:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1+3(\", and the number of such layers is 9 because each time we have \"1+3(\" before a closing parenthesis. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1+3(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on until the innermost is (1+3). So, how many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...)\n3. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had Layer 1 as (1+3), Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer9, which is 1+3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that would be correct. So, 9 layers, each computed step by step. Therefore, my initial calculation of 88,572 should be correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be applied here, like a geometric series or something, but since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nThe recurrence relation here is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since Layer1 is 4).\n\nWait, but actually, Layer1 is (1+3)=4, which is a_1=4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let me verify that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, and both led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{inner expression})\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0 - d/(c-1)) + d/(c-1). In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * (a_0 - 1/(3-1)) + 1/(3-1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe the initial term is different. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me set n=1: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*a_0. So, 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. Then, the general solution would be a_n = 3^n * (a_0 - 1/(3-1)) + 1/(3-1). Plugging in a_0 =1, we get a_n = 3^n * (1 - 1/2) + 1/2 = 3^n*(1/2) + 1/2 = (3^n +1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^n +1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^1 +1)/2 = (3+1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Wait, but earlier, I computed a_1 as 4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Wait, perhaps I should index it differently. If I let a_0 =1, then a_1 =1 +3*a_0=1+3*1=4, which matches. So, the formula would be a_n = (3^{n+1} +1)/2. Let's test that. For n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} +1)/2=(3+1)/2=2. Wait, but a_0 is 1 as per our earlier calculation. Hmm, maybe the formula needs adjustment. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 +1, but let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a geometric series. Let's see: a_1 =4=1+3\n\na_2=1+3*4=1+12=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nWhich is similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some terms, but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n} -1)/2. Let's check:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let's consider that each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, so it's a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)}=C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K=-1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_0=1: 1 = C*3^0 -1/2 =>1 = C -1/2 => C=3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this:\n\nFor n=0: a_0=(3^{1}-1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, correct.\n\nn=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to ensure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying by the outermost factor of 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's do this step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, right. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, yes. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, right.

It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage it without getting lost. I just had to remember to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards, computing each layer one at a time. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next one until you get to the outermost part. I didn't see any immediate pattern or formula that could simplify this, so the straightforward approach was the way to go. Hopefully, I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me just quickly recap the layers to ensure each step was correct: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1092? Let me check: 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Yes, correct. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent one adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers? Let me see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that, so each time we have an additional (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me try to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me write the expression as: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3*\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of these: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2). Continuing up to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another approach. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. Now, let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let me try to compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges. L1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check:\n\nL2 = 3*L1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 3*L2 + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 3*L3 + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nAssume the solution is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1.\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1.\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\nL1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1:\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\n(3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this expression as a base-3 number or something else, but I think the approach I took is solid. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\).\n\n1.

Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. But wait, let me verify my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the innermost part up to Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. Suppose a_n = C*3^n + D. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572. I think I did everything correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each Layer n as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, finding a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (-1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much more efficient. But since the problem didn't specify to use any particular method, just to compute it, either way is fine. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, each layer \\( a_n \\) can be computed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 2*3 = 6. So, putting it all together: 6, 8, 28, 15, 12. Wait, that seems off. Maybe I should write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\nThere's a 2 at the beginning, so 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nSo, putting it together, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Is that correct?\n\nYes, because 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So that's correct.\n\nThen, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer is computed correctly. Another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*1 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, each time, you're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next layer. So, it's like a geometric progression, but since each term depends on the next, it's a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it's similar to a continued fraction or a recursive sequence. In this case, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation. This might have saved some time if I had noticed the pattern earlier, but breaking it down step by step also worked.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times. Each layer computes correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Solving such a recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute L_n directly without computing each layer step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula to compute Layer 9 directly, without computing each layer step by step. That would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But for 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. It can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that for such a recurrence relation, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression a_9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177,147.\n\nTherefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144 /2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the final multiplication: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524\nx     3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, because 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +72=88,572.\n\nEverything checks out. I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, that was correct, and Layer 9 would be the outermost. So, yes, I think I did it right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say I have a simpler version with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*(4) = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. So, the result is 39. Alternatively, if I compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That matches, so my approach works for two layers. Let me try three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. So, the result is 120. Let me check that: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct again. So, my method seems to hold.

    "text": " Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me think if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Because computing nine layers manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3, d = 1. Wait, but our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's similar but with a constant term d = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B, right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula to confirm. Let's compute layer 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, layer 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that my answer is correct. I think I've got it.

Is there another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step? Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for the nth term. Let me consider that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation here. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. First, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. Now, let's find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c = 1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of exponents without computing each layer. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer adds a power of 3. Let me see if I can express this as a geometric series. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n=9 layers. If I let x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n-1 layers, then the expression becomes 3*(1 + 3*x). But that might not directly help. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, that's another way to approach it, using the formula for the nth term. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this result. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation. 3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, then compute the ninth layer and multiply by 3. Both methods led to the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors, as I double-checked each step and even used a different method to confirm the result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step or using a derived formula, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the way I computed it is correct.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D.\n\nNow, solve for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since our problem has 9 layers, that means n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(something). If I expand it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I let x be the innermost expression, then x = 1 + 3x, but that would be if it's infinitely nested. However, in this case, it's only nested 9 times, so it's a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but actually, in this problem, it's finite, so the formula I used earlier is more appropriate.\n\nBut just to see, if I consider the expression as a finite geometric series, each layer adds a term.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with 9 threes.\n\nBut I think the method I used earlier is the most straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost value is found to be 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for all nine layers, resulting in the outermost layer being 29,524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times this value, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me recount to make sure I didn't skip any layers or compute an extra one. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, the number of layers is indeed nine, each corresponding to a set of parentheses.

Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to a geometric series. Let's see: Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a recursive sequence. The problem is asking for 3*a_9, since the outermost expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern. Compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation which can be solved using a closed-form formula. The final result is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, setting equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident with this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (another similar expression).

Let me check that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems quite large, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then each time we go out, it's another layer, so 9 layers in total. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the general formula for a_n can be found using the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me try computing a few more layers using the formula to see if it matches my earlier computations. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches what I had before. a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. So, yes, the formula is working, and therefore, the final result is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each set of parentheses starts with 1+3(...), so each \"1+\" is the start of a new layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+\" appears before the closing parentheses. From the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count how many times we have 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers because each \"1+\" is a new layer, and there are nine of them. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, which leads to Layer 9 being 29,524, and the total being 88,572. Hmm, but let me try computing it again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Now, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) instances. Let's parse the expression from the inside out. Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Each \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis, except the innermost one. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...). Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...))\n- And so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Each \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+\" appears in the nested expressions.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3))\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of \"1+\" inside the parentheses. So, that would mean 9 layers, which is what I did before. So, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the result should indeed be 88,572. However, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, perhaps using a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 (correct)\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 (correct)\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, after verifying with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from 1. The recurrence relation is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1.

The outermost layer is multiplied by 3:\n   - The result is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me break it down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's breaking it down into each digit place. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, reading from top to bottom: 6, 8, 8, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 6 (from the 2*3=6), then 8 (from 9*3+carry), then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that would be 68,572? No, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is 29,524. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      29524\n    x    3\n    --------\n      88572\n\nYes, because 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, it's 88,572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that would be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for such a sequence. The general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be solved, but in this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution would be of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find B. Setting a_n = B, then B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's see, up to Layer 5, I had 364. Let's compute Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27,000; 3*800=2,400; 3*40=120; 3*1=3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is built by this recursion. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in this recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using standard techniques. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution. a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) = A*3^n, and 3*B = 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the initial terms to make sure. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with such large exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19,683, and 3^10 is 59,049. Subtracting 1 gives 59,048, dividing by 2 gives 29,524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula I derived earlier is consistent with that. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check 29524*3 again. 29,524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think again. Is there a pattern or formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually? Maybe recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me check if I did each step correctly, because it's easy to make a multiplication error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. But when I computed Layer 9, I used the previous layers correctly, so that seems right. Let me just double-check the last multiplication: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here.\n\nLooking at each layer, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me write that down:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute a_9 more quickly.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n9/2 = 3A\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2713\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2713\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2713\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, using this formula, a_9 would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not making any off-by-one errors here. The problem is: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, how many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(... So, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n10. ...1 + 3)))\n\nWait, so from the initial 3(, there are nine more layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, in total, there are 10 layers? Wait, no. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe expression has 3( followed by 1 + 3( followed by 1 + 3( ... until the last one is 1 + 3).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n- The first 3( starts the expression.\n- Then, inside, there's 1 + 3(, which is the first layer.\n- Then another 1 + 3(, that's the second layer.\n- Continuing until the last one is 1 + 3), which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so perhaps the innermost is Layer 1, and there are nine layers in total. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9 =29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the expression as starting with 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the ninth layer, then that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I used the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, let me try computing a few more layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nCompute a_4 using the formula:\n\na_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2713 which matches my earlier computation.\n\nSimilarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2713\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2713\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2713\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841 \u2713\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2713\n\nAll correct. So, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. Just using the formula, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we can compute each layer step by step or directly find the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term. This forms a recursive sequence.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula:** Let a_n represent the nth layer. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n   with the innermost layer \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Closed-Form Solution:** Solving the recurrence, we find:\n   \\[ a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Ninth Layer:** For n = 9,\n   \\[ a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times a_9,\n   \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."
