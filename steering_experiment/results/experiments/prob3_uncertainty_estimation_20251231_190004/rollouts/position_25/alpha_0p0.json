So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Hmm, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I have a feeling that maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then 1+3(...), and each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each \"(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the first 3: 1. (1+3(...)) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) 4. (1+3(...)) 5. (1+3(...)) 6. (1+3(...)) 7. (1+3(...)) 8. (1+3(...)) 9. (1+3(...)) Wait, so there are 9 layers inside the first 3. So, my initial count was correct, 9 layers. So, each layer from 1 to 9. So, my calculation seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers again to see if I made any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems to check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, yes, 3 * 29,524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty large, but considering the number of layers, it might make sense. Each layer is tripling the previous result and adding one, so it's growing exponentially. Let me just recap the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of them: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1,093 Layer 7: 3,280 Layer 8: 9,841 Layer 9: 29,524 Each step seems to follow correctly. For example, 4 times 3 is 12 plus 1 is 13. 13 times 3 is 39 plus 1 is 40. 40 times 3 is 120 plus 1 is 121. Yes, that seems right. Continuing up, 121*3=363+1=364, 364*3=1,092+1=1,093, 1,093*3=3,279+1=3,280, 3,280*3=9,840+1=9,841, 9,841*3=29,523+1=29,524. Perfect, so each layer is correct. Then, 29,524*3=88,572.

So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. If I can find a general formula for the nth term, that might save time. Let's denote a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier results to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, but in the expression, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Let me clarify:\n\nThe expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is a_9. So, first, compute a_9, then multiply by 3.\n\nUsing the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer, I could have used a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then multiplied by 3, so:\n\nTotal expression = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step approach. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * Layer 9. Let's do that: Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, that's good. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, that's right. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer, and each time the numbers get bigger quite rapidly. It's like a geometric progression but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a linear recurrence relation. If I recall correctly, such a recurrence would have a closed-form solution, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for the nth term, but since the number of layers is small, step-by-step computation is manageable. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something, so it's like a continued multiplication. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0 - d/(c - 1)) + d/(c - 1). Wait, let me recall the exact formula. For a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients, specifically of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the solution is a_n = r^n*(a_0) + s*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, r = 3 and s = 1, and a_0 = a_1 = 4? Wait, no. Let me see. Actually, the initial term is a_1 = 4, and then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. So, to model this, let's consider the general solution for such a recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is correct as we computed earlier. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, also correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Hmm, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, just to double-check, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine layers, it's faster to compute each step as I did before. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*something, so when expanded, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, how many terms would there be? Each time, the number of terms increases by a factor of 3. Let me see: Let me denote E as the entire expression. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let's try expanding it step by step. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me count the number of 1s and 3s. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum: E = 3 + 3*3*(1) + 3*3*3*(1) + ... up to nine terms? Wait, no, that's not quite right because each layer is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps each layer adds a power of 3. Wait, let me think differently. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the previous is similar, then the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But since each term is 1, the sum inside might be a geometric series. Wait, but in reality, each term is 1, and each multiplication by 3 occurs at each level. Let me try to represent E as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Let's define E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me denote the innermost part as S, which is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer adds another 3*S_prev. Wait, perhaps it's better to think recursively. Let me define S_n as the sum after n layers. Then, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to S_9. Then, E = 3*S_9. Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, using the formula I found, S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using exponents. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are nine layers, maybe the total expression is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Wait, no, that's not quite right because each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see: If I consider the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer out adds another 1 + 3*previous. So, the total sum after n layers would be S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, as before. Which leads us back to the same recurrence relation. So, I think the approach I took initially is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern.

Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go back through each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 +3 =4. a_2=1 +3a_1=1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3a_2=1 +39=40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} =1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1= A*3^1 -1/2=3A -1/2=4. Solving for A: 3A=4 +1/2=9/2, so A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our expression has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Then, 59,048 /2=29,524. So, a_9=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.

Hmm, 3 times 29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it together: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, I end up with 88572 as the final result. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers or make any miscalculations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Each step involves multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and then adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This kind of recursive structure is interesting. It's like each term builds on the previous one, which is a common theme in sequences and series. If I think about it, this is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, but in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, it's not exactly a geometric series, but it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe if I wanted to generalize this, I could find a formula for the nth term. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each one step by step was manageable. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could give me the result without computing each layer individually. Let me think about that. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. I remember that for such recursions, we can find a closed-form solution. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence relation: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and deriving a closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I'm done here. The problem was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then finding a general formula helped me understand the structure better. It's interesting how these nested expressions can be tackled either by expanding each layer or by finding a pattern and deriving a formula. I feel more comfortable with this type of problem now, knowing that there are systematic ways to approach them.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached.

So, I need to compute 3 times 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, it's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then the outermost layer is 3 times the last result. So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all layers, the final result is 88572. Let me just go through each step again quickly to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is a geometric series perhaps? Let me try to model it. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n = 2 to 9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). In this case, c = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, let me index it properly. Since a_1 is the first term, maybe it's better to write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1? Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me think. If I let a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches my earlier computation. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. The solution to this recurrence is a homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The characteristic equation is r = 3*r + 1? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=0, a_0 = 1. So, 1 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. Correct. n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3, so the expression is a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here because each term is nested within another. But given that I already have a formula from the recurrence relation, I think that's sufficient. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I found the result to be 88572. Additionally, by modeling it as a recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88572. So, I'm pretty confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: I can break this down. 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from the top, it's 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as a term in a geometric sequence. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The formula for L_n is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, L_1 is the first term, which is 4. So, maybe L_0 would be 1? Let me check. If n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_1=4, then 4=1 + 3*L_0 => 3*L_0=3 => L_0=1. So, yes, L_0=1. Then, the general formula would be L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1. Because the formula is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Plugging in a=3, b=1, L_0=1: L_n = 3^n * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 * 1 = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's simplify that: 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the result is 88,572. I think this is correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute it again using the formula. Since each L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for a linear recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right?

Let's compute step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do it another way. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, I just thought of something. Each time we compute a layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 (correct)\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840; 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841: Let me compute that again. 3*9000=27,000; 3*800=2,400; 3*40=120; 3*1=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let's compute this more carefully. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step seems to check out. So, the final result is 88,572. But just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\n3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Substitute Layer 1 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Substitute Layer 2 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Substitute Layer 3 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Substitute Layer 4 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Substitute Layer 5 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Substitute Layer 6 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Substitute Layer 7 into the next layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Substitute Layer 8 into the outermost layer.\n   - 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time, we're taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or maybe a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let's compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, let me check that. The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, Layer 9 is the innermost expression before the outermost multiplication. Therefore, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 has only 5 digits, so let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when doing arithmetic quickly, mistakes can happen. Let me verify the multiplication:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carryover\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, yes, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I should recompute some layers to ensure I didn't have an error earlier.\n\nLet me recalculate Layers 1 through 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is correctly computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is of the form:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))\n\nWhich can be represented recursively. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, actually, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost which was 4, and then each subsequent layer built upon that. It's interesting how each layer's value grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is defined recursively. Maybe it's a type of recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a second. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then the recurrence relation would be: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence might give a closed-form formula, but since I only have nine layers, it's probably quicker to compute each one step by step as I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that. If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nBut if I try to express each layer as a sum, maybe I can see a pattern. Let me try to write out the expansion for a few layers to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to notice that each layer is similar to the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2 or something like that. Let me check. Let's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Hmm, that's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which matches a_3.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the multiplications:\n\n3*29524: 29524 *3.\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\), we find that the general solution is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I'm dealing with only 9 layers, computing each step manually is manageable. But just to confirm, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3: 29,000 * 3 = 87,000 524 * 3 = 1,572 So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572 Wait, is that right?

Each step built upon the previous one, and the numbers seem to grow exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but each term adds 1 before multiplying.

Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that's a pretty big number, but considering the expression is nested nine times, each time multiplying by 3, it makes sense that it's so large. I think I did everything correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say, for example, compute $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))$. So, that's four layers instead of nine. Let's compute that step by step. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 3*121 = 363. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, did I make a mistake? Wait, no, in my step-by-step, I got 121 and then 3*121=363, but when I compute directly, I got 120. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check where I went wrong. Wait, in the expression I gave as an example, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))). So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3(1) = 4. Then, moving out, 1 + 3(4) = 13. Then, 1 + 3(13) = 40. Then, 1 + 3(40) = 121. Then, 3*121 = 363. But when I compute directly, I thought it was 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me parse the expression correctly. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3(1) = 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3(4) = 13. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3(13) = 40. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3(40) = 121. Then, the outermost is 3*(121) = 363. So, my initial step-by-step was correct, but when I computed directly, I thought it was 120, which is wrong. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation when I thought I was computing directly. Let me compute it again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, 3(40) is 120, but according to my step-by-step, it should be 363. There's a problem here. Wait, I think I see the confusion. Let me count the number of layers. The original problem I gave as an example is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))). So, that's four layers: the innermost is 1 + 3(1), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3(1) = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 4) = 3*121 = 363. So, when I thought I was computing it directly, I must have miscounted the layers. So, the correct result is 363, not 120. Therefore, my initial step-by-step method is correct. So, in the original problem, with nine layers, the result should indeed be 88,572. Therefore, I think my earlier calculation is correct, and the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off.

Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Let's compute 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let's do it another way. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.

So, putting it all together: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed correctly. So, the total is indeed 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite a large number, but considering each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1 repeatedly, it's exponential growth. So, it's plausible. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but let's see. Wait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p. So, L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: At n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I can be confident that my solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Well, 3*20,000 = 60,000. 3*9,000 = 27,000. 3*500 = 1,500. 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Still correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Yep. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So reading it from top: 6, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572. Let me confirm: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So yes, 68572? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 2*3=6. So writing it all together: 6 (from the 2*3), then 8 (from 9*3 + carry), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carry), and finally 2 (from 4*3). So that would be 6 8 5 7 2, but that's 68572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 29524. 8 +4=12, 4+2=6, 0+5=5, 9+9=18, 5+2=7, 2+0=2. Wait, that's not right. Let me add digit by digit:\n\n  59048\n+29524\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n8 +4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 +2=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n0 +5=5, write 5.\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8.\nSo the sum is 88572. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. So where did I go wrong? Let me check. When I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it down properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      6 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that's not right because when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572, not 68572. So I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me correct that.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Okay, that matches the addition method. So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364.

Adding: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that right. Each step builds on the previous one, and each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer. It's a geometric progression, maybe? Let me think about that. Each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if that works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me go through the layers again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Correct) So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but in my labeling, Layer 9 is the innermost? No, wait, no. Wait, I think I got confused. Let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, my initial approach was correct, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, then building up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me see if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me recall that the solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can compute it as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me see: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

Because each time you have 1 + 3( until the last one is 1 + 3). So, that would make 9 layers in total. So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, we have 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which we computed as 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = Now, adding these up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 (wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3,280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 (correct). Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct). n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13 (correct). n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 (correct). So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Divide by 2: 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let's do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be growing exponentially, which is expected since each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the numbers get large quickly. Let me verify one of the layers again. Let's pick Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think I've done this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9 gives Layer 9 as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me write this down more systematically. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, looking back at the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Wait, no, hold on. Let me double-check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is inside another 3*(...). So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, but let me make sure. Let me write down the original expression again: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis has a 3 multiplied by it, except the very first one. Wait, no, actually, the very first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(next layer). Therefore, my approach of computing each layer step by step is correct. So, after computing L9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Wait, no, that's not right. Because L9 itself is already the result of 1 + 3*(L8), which was the innermost expression. So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, no, no. Let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is L1=4. Then, moving out, L2=1 + 3*L1=13, and so on, up to L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, but in my earlier steps, I computed L9 as 1 + 3*L8, which is the innermost part. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to visualize the structure again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to Layer 9: which would be 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my earlier computation, I ended up with L9=29524, but that was when I computed up to Layer 9 as 1 + 3*L8. So, does that mean that the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524? Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer step by step carefully.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1,500\n\nThen, 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the entire expression was 3*(Layer 9), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so from Layer1 to Layer9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, Layer9 is the innermost, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).

So, after computing up to Layer9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88,572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524.

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, the total is 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain progression. Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is roughly multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*...)), it's a geometric series or something similar. Wait, in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from 1, each time we add 3 times the previous result.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nIf that's the case, then the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), if c \u2260 1.\n\nIn our case, c = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, our starting point is a_1 = 4, so maybe we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nLet me try to model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_n corresponds to n layers. Let me make sure. Since a_1 is the first layer, which is 4, then a_9 would be the ninth layer, which is 29524 as we computed earlier.\n\nLet me compute (3^{10} -1)/2: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the ninth layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my initial computation. When I computed 3*29524, I got 88,572, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just go through the layers again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
