    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is: Final result: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I write it down, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Wait, but let me verify this with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can break down 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Let's compute each part: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...). Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, it's like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I've got it. The final answer is 88572. Let me just quickly recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3. 4. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation, solve it, and compute the ninth term. 5. Both methods lead to the same result, confirming that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches yielded the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost expression:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a minute, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to recognize the pattern. Let's see: a_1=4= (3^1 +1)\na_2=13= (3^2 +3 +1)\na_3=40= (3^3 +9 +3 +1)\nWait, that seems a bit forced. Alternatively, maybe each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check: For a_1=4: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4, correct. a_2=13: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13, correct. a_3=40: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=40, correct. a_4=121: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=121, correct. a_5=364: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=364, correct. a_6=1093: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=1093, correct. a_7=3280: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=3280, correct. a_8=9841: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=9841, correct. a_9=29524: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=29524, correct. So, indeed, each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the innermost layer a_1=4=(3^2 -1)/2, and the outermost layer a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Since 3^{11}=177147, then (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, using the formula, we get the same answer, 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I didn't make any calculation errors as far as I can tell, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). The outermost layer, Layer 9, is \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the result of 3*(Layer 9) is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, yes. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 24*3 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of A*3^n. Then, we can find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that confirms my earlier calculation. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with nested expressions that can get quite large quickly. So, I think I'm done here. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, finally, we have: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Let me verify this multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; So, 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach would work. The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can compute each term step by step, which is what I did earlier. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to express this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as per earlier calculation. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. I think I've got it right. No mistakes noticed this time. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively calculating each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. The result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, that seems pretty big, but given the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but since each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me see: If I have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then the general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The general form is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's compute a few more terms to find a pattern: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier terms: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 =4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I had to compute it without the formula, I would have to compute each layer step by step as I did before, which also led me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the next layer. Let me write this down systematically:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure:\n\n29524 * 3:\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nHmm, 88572 seems correct. Let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to skip a step or miscalculate. Let me recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll layers check out. So, the outermost multiplication is 3*29524, which is 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps using a formula for such recursive expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recursive relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. To find L_9, I can use this recursive formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can solve this recurrence relation. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, so both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. If I expand this, it's similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut I think the recursive approach was more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each time we're adding a term that's 3^n. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps the total sum can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, same result.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. From the recursive formula, we saw that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4, and we have L_9, then the expression is 3*L_9.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), it's similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, I consistently get 88572 as the result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nCompute each part:\n20000*3 = 60000\n9000*3 = 27000\n500*3 = 1500\n20*3 = 60\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdd them together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times with different methods: step-by-step computation, recursive formula, and breaking down the multiplication. All approaches lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do this step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap to ensure I didn't skip any layers. I started from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiplied by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 12 =13. L(3) =1 +3*L(2)=1+39=40. Hmm, so each L(n) =1 +3*L(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We have L(n) = 1 +3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C =1 +3C => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4. When n=1, L(1)=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)= (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo compute the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me check that again. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because this number seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:  \n20000 * 3 = 60000  \n9000 * 3 = 27000  \n500 * 3 = 1500  \n24 * 3 = 72  \nAdding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:  \n29524  \n\u00d7     3  \n--------  \n88572  \n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. So, each time we have another layer. Let me count how many layers there are. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3(Layer1). Layer3:1+3(Layer2), etc., up to Layer9. So, yes, 9 layers in total. So, my earlier calculation is correct with 9 layers. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4  \nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13  \nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40  \nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121  \nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364  \nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093  \nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280  \nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841  \nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524  \n\nYes, each step checks out. Then, 29524*3=88572. So, I think I can be confident that this is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. If it were more layers, I might look for a pattern or a recursive formula to compute it more efficiently. But for nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. So, to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we then multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. And that gives us 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. After calculating up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1.

That's the same number, just written differently. So, 1 + 3*364 is indeed 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.

I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n can be computed recursively. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^{n} * (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) when r \u2260 1. Wait, let me check that formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this alternative method confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in either method, so I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

It's like each step is following the formula: next_layer = 1 + 3 * previous_layer. Starting from 4, each subsequent layer grows rapidly. I think this approach is solid because each step only depends on the previous one, so as long as I compute each layer correctly, the final result should be accurate. Let me just recap the layers to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that looks right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to follow logically from the previous one. It's interesting how each layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and then adds 1, leading to exponential growth. So, after nine layers, the number becomes quite large, but manageable step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841.

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 multiplied by 3. I can break it down: 29,000 * 3 = 87,000; 524 * 3 = 1,572. Adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, that's right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The general form for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))))). Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to represent the expression as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))))). Let me see if I can find a pattern or express S in terms of itself. Wait, but since each layer is similar, maybe S can be expressed recursively. Let me think. Let me consider that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*next_layer, and the entire expression is 3*(first_layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, then L2 =1 +3*L1, L3=1 +3*L2, and so on, up to L9. Then, S =3*L9. But since each Lk =1 +3*L_{k-1}, starting from L1=4, as we saw earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me start from the innermost layer and work my way out, writing each step as I go. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 +3 =4\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the initial layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, if I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The total number of terms is 9 layers, so perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Starting from the innermost term, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4. The next is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4). If I expand this, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2*4, but wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, maybe the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1. The next layer is 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13. The next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, it's getting a bit messy. Maybe using the formula I found earlier is better. Since we've already confirmed that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by (Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of recursion. If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. The outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which makes me more confident that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see. Starting from the innermost term, which is 4, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the first term is 4, then 13, 40, 121, etc. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. But since each term is defined recursively, perhaps the formula I derived earlier is the most straightforward way to compute it. Either way, I think I've confirmed that the value is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost layer. By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading up to the ninth layer, which is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, but let me try to see if there's a pattern. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me see: (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Well, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; and the last digit is 0. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\nFirst digit: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So, 2, carryover 1.\n\nSecond digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nThird digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Let me verify using another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A\u00d73^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A\u00d73^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A\u00d73^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me continue this process. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so I need to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each layer seems correct. Then, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before. So, maybe it is correct after all. Alternatively, I can use another method to compute 29524 * 3. Let's see:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression had nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. That's a recursive relation. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I did before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result without computing each layer manually. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it's a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let's denote E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand E step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me define each nested expression:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nE = 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's exactly the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. So, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now. Just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer using the closed-form formula. Let's say Layer 5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches what I had earlier. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: L_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

So, I need to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. I can break this down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, right. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, that's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, right. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern in the layers. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me write it down: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for Layer n. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose Layer n = A*3^n + B. Then, Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1) = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have Layer n = A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating the coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + (1 + 3B). Therefore, B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition Layer 1 = 4. Layer 1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For Layer 1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 81 -1 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, since Layer n is defined as (3^(n+1) -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the outermost layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...). So, after computing L9, which is the outermost layer, do I need to multiply it by 3? Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested parentheses. So, after computing the innermost up to the outermost layer, which gives me L9 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*L9, right?\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the parentheses. The parentheses themselves are the entire nested structure, which we've computed as L9 = 29524. So, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +2 =8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm each step again because sometimes when I do arithmetic in my head, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add carryover 1: 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, but earlier, when I computed L9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check each layer again because maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, when I compute L9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...)\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(\" is another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nAfter the first 3(, we have 1 + 3(, then another 1 + 3(, etc., until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is the start of the first layer: 1 + 3(...)\n\nThen, each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- After the first 3(, we have 1 + 3(...\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(\", so let's count how many \"1 + 3(\" there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more ( before the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is the start of the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another (, so that's the second layer, and so on.\n\nLet me count each (:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the entire expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( is after 3, then each subsequent ( is part of the next layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after the first 1 + 3\n3. ( after the second 1 + 3\n...\nContinuing until the innermost ( which is after the 8th 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of ( in the entire expression.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (:\n\n- The first ( after 3: 1\n- Then, inside that, another ( after 1 + 3: 2\n- Inside that, another ( after 1 + 3:3\n- And so on, until the innermost ( after 1 + 3: Let's see.\n\nWait, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another ( after it. So, how many ( are there in total?\n\nLet me count from the start:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of ( is equal to the number of layers. Let me count:\n\n1. The first ( after 3\n2. Then, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another (, so from the first layer, we have 1, then each subsequent layer adds another.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( is part of the next layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to L9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me confirm if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is the first layer: 1 + 3(...)\n2. Inside that, another ( after 1 + 3: second layer\n3. And so on, until the innermost ( which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each time \"1 + 3(\" is another layer.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count each occurrence of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. After the first (, it's 1 + 3(\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count:\n\nFrom the start:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each time \"1 + 3(\" is another layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. The first ( after 3: layer 1\n2. Inside that, another ( after 1 + 3: layer 2\n3. Inside that, another ( after 1 + 3: layer 3\n...\nContinuing until the innermost ( which is after the 8th 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (:\n\n- The first ( after 3: 1\n- Then, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another (:\n\nSo, starting from 1, each time we have a (, we increase the count.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. After 3:\n   - 3(\n   \n2. Inside that, after 1 + 3:\n   - 3(1 + 3(\n   \n3. Inside that, another ( after 1 + 3:\n   - 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(\n   \n4. And so on, until the innermost (.\n\nWait, but the innermost part is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another (. So, how many ( are there in total?\n\nLet me count:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count each (:\n\n1. After 3: 1\n2. After the first 1 + 3: 2\n3. After the second 1 + 3: 3\n4. After the third 1 + 3:4\n5. After the fourth 1 + 3:5\n6. After the fifth 1 + 3:6\n7. After the sixth 1 + 3:7\n8. After the seventh 1 + 3:8\n9. After the eighth 1 + 3:9\n10. After the ninth 1 + 3:10\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another ( after it. So, the number of ( is equal to the number of layers, which is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time I have a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, each time we go outwards, we add another layer.\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(layer2)=1 +3*13=40\n\n...\n\nUp to layer9:1 +3*(layer8)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is layer9. So, that's correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me check the number of layers again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each time \"1 + 3(\" is another layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs, which is 9 times.\n\nTherefore, layer1 to layer9, each computed as above.\n\nSo, layer9 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nL1:1 +3=4\n\nL2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, perhaps I should check if I'm correctly multiplying by 3 at the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the outermost operation is already included in layer9, so I shouldn't multiply by 3 again. Wait, no, because the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression, which we computed as layer9=29524. So, the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me consider a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this.\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 +3)))\n\n=3(1 +3(1 +3*4))\n\n=3(1 +3(1 +12))\n\n=3(1 +3*13)\n\n=3(1 +39)\n\n=3*40=120\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, using the same approach, for the original problem with 9 layers, the result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_i \\) as follows:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...Layer 9...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, that's 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait a second, let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n________\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, that's 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Hmm, let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high. Let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

So, writing it out: 88572. So, yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. To find A and B, we can solve using the initial condition. Let's see: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the total expression is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because L_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. That's a more straightforward approach, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a geometric series pattern. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the solution simplifies to \\(3 \\times \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\\), which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or check with a calculator. Alternatively, I can think about the pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n ranges from 1 to 9. Then, the recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut since each term is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, we can generalize that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince the outermost layer is Layer 9, the value is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps this can be represented as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If we expand this, it's a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to n, but I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, in our case, the layers are 9, so n=9. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait a second, so each Layer n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, for Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =13\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, Layer 2 was 13, which is the sum up to 3^2. Similarly, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is sum_{k=0}^{3} 3^k = (81 -1)/2 =40.\n\nWait, so in general, Layer n is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches our earlier formula.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this approach also confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for a geometric series. The sum S = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, for each Layer n, the sum is S_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly what we have. So, using this formula, Layer 9 is S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524=88572.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each time we add 1 and multiply by 3, it's similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Maybe not necessary, since we've already confirmed it using two methods: step-by-step computation and the geometric series formula.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute the expression again step by step, just in case I made a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let's compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Final multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so each step seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I recall that expressions like a + r*(a + r*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using methods for solving linear recursions. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n9/2 = 3*C\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using the formula for the nth layer, we determine the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the total value should be 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524: 29524*3, let's compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. Another way to approach it might be to recognize a pattern or formula, but I'm not sure. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. It seems similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Let me consider the general form: If we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step was straightforward and manageable, especially since there are only nine layers. It's a good exercise in careful arithmetic and attention to detail to ensure that each step is correct before moving on to the next.

So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3 = 1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, and so on. This recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, the original problem has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result again. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let's think about expanding the expression. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Each time, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). If we expand this, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to write out the entire expression expanded. The innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, and so on. Wait, actually, each layer adds another power of 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3^1, then the next is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2, and so on, up to 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. Because each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so for 9 layers, the innermost would be 3^1, and the outermost would be 3^8. So, the sum inside the outermost parentheses would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is a geometric series with ratio 3. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) where n is the number of terms. Here, n=9 terms (from 3^0 to 3^8), so the sum is (3^9 -1)/2. Wait, but earlier I had L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me think again. If each layer adds another power of 3, starting from 3^1, then after 9 layers, the highest power would be 3^9. Wait, but in my earlier calculation using the recurrence relation, I had L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, which would be the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k. But in the problem, how many terms are we adding? Let me count the number of 1's in the expansion. The innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, etc. So, each layer adds another 1 and another power of 3. Wait, but actually, each time you have 1 + 3*(previous sum). So, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Because each multiplication by 3 adds another power. So, the sum is from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier I had Layer 9 as 29524, which is 3*9841 +1? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers here. Let me clarify. If I have 9 layers, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another power of 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3^1) = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. The next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3^1 + 3^2) = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds a new power of 3. So, after 9 layers, the sum inside would be 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. So, the sum is from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result of 88572. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, no, the problem is that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the sum, which includes the 1 and the inner 3*(...). So, perhaps the sum inside is 1 + 3*(sum of inner terms). So, maybe the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k) which would be 3*(9841) = 29523. But that's not matching my initial calculation where I got 88572. Wait, so where am I going wrong? Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1's. Each time you have a new 1, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 ones, right? Because each layer adds another 1. So, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). So, that sum is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. Which is a geometric series with 9 terms, from 3^0 to 3^8. So, the sum is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523. But wait, in my initial step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 88572, which is 3*29524. So, there's a discrepancy here. I must be miscounting the layers. Let me check again. When I did the step-by-step, I had Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. But according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside should be 9841, and 3*9841=29523, not 29524. So, which one is correct? Let me compute Layer 9 again. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Then Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. So, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, not 9841. So, where did I go wrong in the geometric series approach? Ah, I see. The sum inside the outermost parentheses is not just the sum from 3^0 to 3^8, but it's actually the result of the recurrence relation, which includes each layer adding 1 + 3*(previous sum). So, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is Layer9, which is 29524, not the sum of the geometric series. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the step-by-step approach was correct, and the geometric series approach was misapplied because I didn't account for the fact that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous sum), not just adding another power of 3. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. To double-check, let me compute it using the formula I derived earlier. L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication or in one of the layers. Let me recompute Layer 9: Layer 8 was 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. That seems correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Hmm, same result. Maybe it's correct after all. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses, so nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my initial approach was correct. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my calculation of Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Let me check another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think: If I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I calculated before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, and the recurrence relation approach confirmed the result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form: Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. From the recurrence: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1. Let's substitute the general form into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. From Layer 1: When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, substituting n=1 into the general form: Layer 1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general form is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with Layer 1: (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^(2+1) -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^(9+1) -1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so we have: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. I can compute this step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, that's right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, that's accurate. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which resembles a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me explore that approach to verify. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. This seems to be a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help me compute it more efficiently. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and verifying with a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, I determined that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer.
