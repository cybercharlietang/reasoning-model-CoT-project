    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for such recursive expressions. Let me consider that each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me try to solve it. Assume L_n = C, a constant. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2. 243*243: 200*200=40000, 200*43=8600, 43*200=8600, 43*43=1849. Wait, that's too convoluted. Alternatively, 243*243: (240 + 3)^2 = 240^2 + 2*240*3 + 3^2 = 57600 + 1440 + 9 = 57600 + 1440 = 59040 +9=59049. Yes, correct. So, 3^10=59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The layers seem to follow a recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. On the other hand, according to the general solution, Ln should also be A*3^n + B. Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers are integers. Maybe that's okay, but let me check. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the general solution. Alternatively, maybe the particular solution is a constant, so let me try to find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3 Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0 => r=3. So the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer manually. That's a good way to verify the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a nested pattern where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation $L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}$ with $L_1 = 4$. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form expression $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For the ninth layer ($L_9$), this gives $L_9 = 29524$. Multiplying by 3, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4 (from the innermost layer). Wait, actually, in our case, a_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, which is correct. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The sum of such a series can be represented as (3^{n} - 1)/2, which aligns with the closed-form solution I derived earlier. So, whether I compute each layer manually, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. It's always good to verify the answer using multiple methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the terms again: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost part is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recompute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me do this multiplication carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524*3 in another way to verify. Let's break it down: 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 +1500=88500 88500 +60=88560 88560 +12=88572. Yes, same result. So, the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(...), and inside there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and then we multiply by 3. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, starting from layer 1 = 4, layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a geometric sequence, but with a twist because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of layer n. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. We know that L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's assume L(n) = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: L(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for layer 9: L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, double-checked each layer, and even derived a formula to confirm the result.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, as computed. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let me consider that each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes. It's interesting how the nested structure can be broken down using a recurrence relation, which makes the computation much faster, especially if the number of layers increases. Without recognizing the pattern, computing each layer step by step would still work, but it's more time-consuming. I guess practice helps in noticing these patterns more quickly. Anyway, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4.

But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the expression inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So yes, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, each layer is defined recursively by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's write down the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form expression, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. Let me just verify the final multiplication once more to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524\nx     3\n-------\nStarting from the rightmost digit: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, no, the way we write it is from the last digit to the first, so the first digit we write is 2, then 7, then 5, then 8, then 8. Wait, no, actually, when you write it down, you start from the right. So the rightmost digit is 2, then moving left: 7, then 5, then 8, then 8. So the number is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if that approach would work. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which also matches. So, each term is generated by this recurrence relation. The problem is that with each layer, we're adding another 3*(previous term). So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost one, but wait, in the original problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside is 1+3(...), which is layer 1. Then inside that is another 1+3(...), layer 2, and so on. Let's count the number of layers. From the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see how many times 1+3 appears. Let's write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1+3(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1+3(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1+3(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1+3(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1+3(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. Therefore, Layer 9 is the innermost one, but in the formula I derived earlier, a_n corresponds to the nth layer, starting from a_1 as the innermost. Wait, no, in my earlier computation, a_1 was the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3. Then a_2 was Layer 2, etc., up to a_9 being Layer 9. So, according to the formula, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. That's much quicker. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I can find that the value is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors. 1. I started by computing each layer step by step, which gave me Layer 9 as 29524. 2.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether there's a way to represent this as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. To be thorough, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches Layer 4. Similarly, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the computation is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... Up to L_9. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3, so maybe L_1 is the innermost, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, I get 88572 as the final answer. I think I can confidently say that's the correct value. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recap: Each layer is computed by 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from 4, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 1. The closed-form formula gives me L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the entire expression, it's (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, to save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can express this recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then the final answer is 3*a_9. So, we can see that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.

The key was recognizing the pattern and then either computing each layer step by step or finding a formula to compute it more efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...).

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have been faster, especially for more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recursive formula: Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without doing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me denote the innermost expression as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might save time. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the ninth layer, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_n =3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This looks like a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote L_k as the value of layer k. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_k = a*L_{k-1} + b, the solution is L_k = a^k * C + d, where d is the particular solution. Wait, let me check. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_k^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer k, the value is (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, since L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently through both iterative computation and using the recurrence relation formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can recognize the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. Plug n=1 into a_n = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the initial layers to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach confirmed the result.

Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3*(...). So starting from the innermost, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1+\" before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, maybe a better way is to count the number of times 1+3 appears nested.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since the expression is quite nested. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can recognize it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 / 2 =88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, so whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. So, I think I'm done here. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a general formula for the nth layer, which made the computation much faster, especially since the expression has nine layers. It's interesting how recognizing recurrence relations can simplify such problems. I guess practice makes perfect, and being able to spot these patterns is really helpful in math.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Let me check if there's a formula for a geometric series here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Let me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. According to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.

Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So total is 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then 29524 *3: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a geometric series or recursive sequence. Let me see. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see: The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...), so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, this method also gives 88572. Therefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is the same. I think this confirms that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Suppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each layer is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger n. But since n=9 isn't too large, computing each layer step by step works too. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check Layer 8 again. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer7. Layer7 is 3280. So 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So writing it out: 9841 * 3 = 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but I feel like this number is quite large. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. So, each term can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on up to a_9=29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, so perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, either method works.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find A and B. First, plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Then, plug in n=2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, from the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula to compute L_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time. But since I was just starting out, computing each layer step by step helped me understand the pattern. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the layers form a geometric progression. Let me explore that. If I consider the expression inside the outermost parentheses, it's L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8, and L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7, and so on. So, expanding L_9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. In general, a geometric series is S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-1}. In this case, the series would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, because there are 9 terms (from L_1 to L_9). Wait, actually, L_9 is 1 + 3*L_8, and L_8 is 1 + 3*L_7, etc., so if I expand L_9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would result in 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. So, L_9 is the sum of a geometric series with first term a=1, common ratio r=3, and number of terms n=9. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = (a*(r^n -1))/(r -1). Plugging in the values: S_9 = (1*(3^9 -1))/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier I had L_9 as 29524, which is much larger than 9841. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Let me check where I might have gone wrong. Wait, no, because L_9 is not the sum up to 3^8, but rather, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, actually, the expansion would have more terms. Let me think again. Let's consider L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. So, each L_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, but in L_1, n=1: 1 + 3^0 =1? Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3 =4, which is 1 + 3^1. L_2 is 1 + 3 + 9 =13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. L_3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 =40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k -1? Wait, no, because when n=1, sum is 1 +3=4, which is sum_{k=0}^1 3^k =1+3=4. Similarly, L_2=1+3+9=13=sum_{k=0}^2 3^k=1+3+9=13. So, yes, L_n = sum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier. Therefore, L_9 = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series multiplied by 3. But perhaps that's complicating it more. The step-by-step approach seems manageable. To make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the key steps again. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, L_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all methods lead to the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with our earlier computations: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to think about it. So, either by expanding each layer step by step, or by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, it's perhaps more straightforward to compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier. Another way to think about it is that each time you have 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to building a number in base 3 or something, but I think the step-by-step computation is the most straightforward approach here. So, to recap, by computing each layer from the inside out, I arrived at the final value of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: L1: 4 L2:1 + 3*4=13 L3:1 + 3*13=40 L4:1 + 3*40=121 L5:1 + 3*121=364 L6:1 + 3*364=1093 L7:1 + 3*1093=3280 L8:1 + 3*3280=9841 L9:1 + 3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any calculation errors this time. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1)\\), starting with \\(L(1) = 4\\). This recurrence leads to the formula \\(L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, maybe I should check the computation of 3*29524 again. Let me do it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40 And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n +3B +1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: a_1= A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4. So 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. Suppose we have only one layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. If I compute it as per the method above, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*4 = 12. Correct. Now two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Using the method: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13, then 3*13=39. Correct. Three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Using the method: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:1 +3*13=40, then 3*40=120. Correct. So the method seems to work for smaller numbers, so likely correct for nine layers.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me model it. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming a_n = A*3^n + B, then: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I expand it, maybe it's a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to write it out. Starting from the innermost: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*(4) =12. Then, moving out: 3*(1 + 3*(4))=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. Then, next layer: 3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. Hmm, but wait, this seems similar to the earlier layers. Alternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum. Let me think recursively. Let me denote S as the entire expression. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. But each layer is similar, so perhaps S = 3*(1 + 3*S'), where S' is the inner expression. But wait, that might not be the case because each layer is a separate expression. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), where the inner expression is similar to S but with fewer layers. But since there are nine layers, it's a bit more involved. Alternatively, since I already found a closed-form formula for a_n, which is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, that seems to be the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding each multiplication step by step. Let me try that approach to verify. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent with the previous methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. 29524 *3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 29524\n\u00d7      3\n------------\nStarting from the rightmost digit: 4\u00d73=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit:5\u00d73=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit:9\u00d73=27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit:2\u00d73=6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence relation? Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3 and d = 1. Wait, actually, let me write it correctly. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. Here, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c=3, d=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*a_9 and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. But since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1). Wait, let me check. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s. In this case, r=3, s=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods led me to the same answer, and I double-checked each step.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, let's see: when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. If I take a_0 as the term before the first one, but in our case, a_1 is the first computed term. So maybe the formula is slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as a geometric series. Let's try to expand a few layers to see the pattern. Let's say we have a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + (3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 39 = 40. Similarly, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, but 120 is 3*40, which is 3*(1 + 3*13). Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each a_n as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1 =4, then a_2=13, up to a_9. So, the outermost layer is a_9, and then we multiply by 3. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*29524 =88572, which matches what I computed earlier by expanding each layer step by step. So, this formula gives us the same result without having to compute each layer individually, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers increases.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let's see, the general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check by computing a few more layers manually to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let me compute up to Layer 4 again: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Yes, that's correct. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Then Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation, the solution is confirmed using a formula for the linear recurrence. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the outermost multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recursive sequence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has a root r=3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3C +1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 +1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
