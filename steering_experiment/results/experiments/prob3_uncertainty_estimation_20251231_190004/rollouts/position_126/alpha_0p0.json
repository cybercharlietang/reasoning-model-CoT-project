Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572.

Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, leading to the final result of 29,524 for the innermost expression. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1.

Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let's count the number of layers: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. From the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, it's 9 layers deep. Therefore, n=9 in the formula. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, let's compute using the formula: total = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2 Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, total = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.
