Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the closed-form expression from the start. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer.

Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, but in this case, since we have a closed-form solution, it's more efficient. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step without making a mistake, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   \n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
