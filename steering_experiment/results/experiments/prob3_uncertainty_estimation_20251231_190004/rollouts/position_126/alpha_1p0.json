Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute one more layer step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Let's check Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the closed-form approach seems more efficient. But since I already computed each layer and got the same result, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

Therefore, there are 9 layers, meaning n=9 in the recurrence relation. So, the calculation is correct, leading to a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few layers using the closed-form formula and see if they match my earlier computations.\n\nFor example, layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nLayer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nLayer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nLayer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, correct.\n\nLayer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nLayer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nLayer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the closed-form formula works, and the step-by-step computation is consistent. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the problem.\n\n2. Decide to compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n3. Computed each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n4. Then, noticed that the expression could be modeled as a recurrence relation.\n\n5. Solved the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression.\n\n6. Verified that the closed-form gave the same results as the step-by-step computation.\n\n7. Then, applied the multiplication by 3 to the outermost layer.\n\n8. Double-checked the multiplication to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\n9. Cross-verified using both methods to ensure the answer is correct.\n\nSo, after all these steps, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but it's always good to be thorough, especially with nested expressions that can be easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's similar to 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). This kind of structure can be expressed as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. The closed-form formula we derived earlier is an example of that.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out all the terms, it would be:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with everything else. So, I think that's solid.\n\nI guess another way to see this is that each layer is building up a number that's one more than three times the previous number. So, each time, you're scaling up by 3 and adding 1. That's why the numbers grow so quickly\u2014exponential growth with base 3.\n\nJust to get a sense of how big these numbers get, starting from 4, each layer is roughly 3 times the previous. So, after 9 layers, it's 3^9 times the initial value, which is 19683 times 4, but since we're adding 1 each time, it's a bit more involved. But the closed-form formula accounts for that.\n\nIn any case, I think I've thought this through thoroughly, checked my work in multiple ways, and I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we find the solution step by step.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

There are 9 such layers, with the outermost being multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9):**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me recompute 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's do it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, if I let the entire expression be E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.
