Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the innermost is 4, then 13, which is 1 + 3*4, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps writing out the expansion. Let me try that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote E = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*E, where E is the previous layer. But perhaps expanding all terms would be too cumbersome, but maybe recognizing that each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 is like a geometric progression. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series: The sum S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-1} = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). But in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. As I solved earlier, the closed-form is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds another factor of 3. So, the total number of terms would be 3^9, but that's not exactly accurate because each layer is nested. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. Let me just confirm the calculations once again to be sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572.

Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the final step is multiplying the outermost result by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"
