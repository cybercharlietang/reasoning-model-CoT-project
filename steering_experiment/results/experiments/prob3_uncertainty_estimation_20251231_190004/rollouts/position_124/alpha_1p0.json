Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But since it's a finite number of terms, computing each step or using the closed-form formula both work. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
