So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check the closed-form approach to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging in, we found B = -1/2, and then using a_1 = 4 to find A = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems solid. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so each step is 3*(previous) +1. So starting from 4, each step is 3*prev +1. Let me see: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 3*4 +1 = 13 Layer 3: 3*13 +1 = 40 Layer 4: 3*40 +1 = 121 Layer 5: 3*121 +1 = 364 Layer 6: 3*364 +1 = 1093 Layer 7: 3*1093 +1 = 3280 Layer 8: 3*3280 +1 = 9841 Layer 9: 3*9841 +1 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 +12=88572 Yes, that's correct. So, all methods lead to the same result.

By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 = 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and closed-form, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form solution, confirming the result. The final computation yields the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a closed-form formula and compute the final value.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
