    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, so I need to be careful with the order of operations. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 1s and 3s. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). Each layer seems to be multiplying by 3 after adding 1. So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nI can see that after the first 3(, there are nine layers of 1+3(...). Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1+3, which is the last part: 1+3.\n2. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3)\n3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result)\n4. This continues until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them from the inside out. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\nL2: 1 + 3*L1\nL3: 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9: 1 + 3*L8\nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3*(L9)\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 inside:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3(, there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me write it out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost 1 + 3. That's 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(result from the inner layer).\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step:\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(S9). So:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 29,524.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute directly:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my steps because that's a lot of computation, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, total = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check S7 again because 3*1,093 is 3,279, and 3,279 +1 is 3,280. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, S8: 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Correct.\n\nS9: 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: as computed, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29,524 another way. Maybe using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another approach: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That also checks out.\n\nSo, after computing each step carefully, I arrive at the total of 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) operation.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I compute S1 to S9, that's 9 layers. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original expression:\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... )))\n\nSo yes, 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, my computation seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each step as \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_9 \\), where each \\( S_i \\) represents the result of the \\( i \\)-th layer.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times S_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[ S_9 = 1 + 3 \\times S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times S_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

    "text": " It's this expression with a bunch of nested parentheses and multiplication by 3 each time. Let me write it out to see it more clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. I need to compute this step by step. Hmm, okay, so it's a nested expression where each time, you have 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. Let me see how many layers there are here.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time, there's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and so on. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" parts.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, each subsequent layer starts with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. From the innermost to the outermost, it's:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Let me check again. Each time, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is the 9th layer, then each layer wraps around it. So, actually, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... 9 times ... )).\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, since we have 9 layers, let me start from the innermost and go outward.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say we have an expression E_n, where n is the layer number. Starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, up to E9, which is the innermost part, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that, and the outermost is 3 times that.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to compute starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time computing the value and substituting it into the next layer.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" has a closing parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, computing each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7\n\n24: 5*3=15 +7=22, write down 2, carry over 2\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote E_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, E1 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total is 3*E9 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants.\n\nWe can solve for A and B.\n\nGiven E1 = 4, E2 = 13, etc.\n\nBut maybe it's overcomplicating since we only have 9 layers, and computing step by step is manageable.\n\nBut just to check, let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^{n}\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form E_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\n3^{10} is 59049\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E9 =3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*E9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Okay, so it's like a chain of additions and multiplications. Let me try to break it down from the innermost part because that's usually the best way to handle nested expressions.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part becomes 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Wait, let me make sure I parse this correctly. Each level is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next level. So, it's like a recursive structure.\n\nLet me try to represent each level step by step.\n\nLet me number the levels from the innermost as Level 1 to the outermost as Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, counting the number of 3s might help. Let me count how many times 3 is used as a multiplier. Hmm, I see 9 instances of 3(1 + ... So, that suggests there are 9 layers. Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Level 9: 1 + 3(Level 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3(Level 9). Wait, no, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), which is Level 9. So, actually, the outermost expression is 3(Level 9). Let me structure this properly.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each level as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3 * L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3 * L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3 * L8\n\nThen, the final result is 3 * L9.\n\nSo, I can compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me compute each level one by one.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3 * L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3 * L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3 * L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3 * L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3 * L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3 * L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3 * L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3 * L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the final result is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nWell, 3 * 29524 can be computed as:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, but 29524 is 29000 + 524. Alternatively, let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any errors in computing each level. Let me go through each step again.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if each level is following a certain formula.\n\nLooking at the levels:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nHmm, let's see if there's a recurrence relation here. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since we've already computed up to L9, maybe it's not necessary. But just for fun, let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has solution L_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nSo, yeah, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 +24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +72 = 88572\n\nYes, same result. So, confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each layer step by step without getting confused.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). But wait, the innermost was the last one, so the next layer is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*4. Wait, hold on, is it 3*(result) or just 3 added? Looking back at the problem, it's 3 multiplied by the parentheses. So, each time it's 3*(1 + something). So, the structure is like 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each step is 3*(1 + something).\n\nSo, let me correct that. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). So, that's 4. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Hmm, maybe I should write each step as I go.\n\nLet me try to outline each layer from the inside out.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, hold on. Let me count the layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). So, that's Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, we have Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers? Let me check: starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me count the number of 3s after each parenthesis.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...).

Let me count how many 3s are there:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, each time, we compute the innermost and work our way out. So, as I did before, Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 36084. Let me verify each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check Layer 9 again: 1 + 12027 = 12028; 12028 * 3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000 +84=36084. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), each time there's a 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3s is 9, meaning 9 layers. So, my calculation up to Layer 9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. Let me write the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds on the previous one by adding 1, multiplying by 3, and then moving outward.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15\n\na_3 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48\n\na_4 = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147\n\na_5 = 3 + 3*147 = 3 + 441 = 444\n\na_6 = 3 + 3*444 = 3 + 1332 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3 + 3*1335 = 3 + 4005 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3 + 3*4008 = 3 + 12024 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3 + 3*12027 = 3 + 36081 = 36084\n\nYes, same result. So, the 9th term is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this recurrence relation as a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3 => C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3A - 3/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6.\n\nBut let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5 * 11 = 5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5 from that: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the result is indeed 36084.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 3 each time, but the closed-form approach confirms it.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 36084.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute back into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Okay, so I need to compute this step by step. Let me see if I can break it down from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. Each time, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), which is 4. So, each time we replace the innermost parentheses, we work our way outward. Let me try to count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the original expression, I can see there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me check:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3).\n2. Then moving outward, each subsequent set is (1 + 3(previous result)).\n3. So, starting from the innermost, each step will involve multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each step is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let me compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me count the layers again to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each with a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one step out.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nSo, let me list each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, after computing each layer, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait a minute, let me verify that. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might make a multiplication error. Let me double-check each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nGiven that, starting from L_1 = 4, we can compute each subsequent layer as 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nSo, indeed, the computation as done above is correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing all 9 layers, the final result is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. **Layer 2**: Multiply the result by 3 and add 1.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n3. **Layer 3**: Repeat the process.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n4. **Layer 4**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n5. **Layer 5**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n6. **Layer 6**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n7. **Layer 7**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n8. **Layer 8**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n9. **Layer 9**: Finally, compute the outermost layer.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

It looks like each step involves multiplying by 3 after adding 1. I think I'll need to work from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to break it down layer by layer.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.

Let me check that multiplication again because 9841 seems like a big number, and multiplying by 3 might be a bit off.\n\nWait, 9841 * 3: Let me compute it step by step.\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 1*3 = 3\n- 4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n- 9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29\n\nSo writing it down: 29523.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me confirm:\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 800*3 = 2400\n- 40*3 = 120\n- 1*3 = 3\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 29523.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check all the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nLet me list out each layer's result:\n\nLayer 9: 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is built upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So the process seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So if I denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1 = 4, then a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is a_9 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, and so on, up to a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2, and then the total expression is 3*a_1.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that: the innermost is layer 9, which is a_9 = 4. Then layer 8 is a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, layer 7 is a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on until layer 1 is a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2. Then the entire expression is 3*a_1.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, layer 1 was 3*9841, but according to this notation, a_1 would be 1 + 3*a_2, and the total expression would be 3*a_1. Hmm, perhaps my initial labeling was off. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index from the innermost as a_1, then the next as a_2, up to a_9, and then the outermost is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, you have 1 + 3*(something), and that something is the next inner expression.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4, let's call that a_1.\n\nThen the next layer out is 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is a_2.\n\nThen a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, up to a_9, which would be the result after 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time it's 1 + 3(...), so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So from the innermost, we have 9 layers before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, we had 9 layers, each time moving outward. So perhaps a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the result before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so if a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, and then the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is 9841.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, we had 9 layers, each time moving outward, so a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, ..., a_9 = 9841, and then the total is 3*a_9 = 29523. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but in our earlier calculation, a_9 was 9841, but according to this formula, a_9 would be 29524. Wait, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake in the indexing. Because in our problem, the innermost is layer 9, but according to the formula, a_1 = 4, a_2 =13, etc., up to a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the formula says a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So when n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nBut in our earlier step-by-step calculation, a_9 was 9841, which is (3^8 -1)/2, because 3^8 is 6561, 6561-1=6560, 6560/2=3280, which is a_7.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see: the innermost layer is a_1 =4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2.\n\nThen each layer corresponds to n=1 to n=9, so the outermost layer before the final multiplication is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nBut in our earlier step-by-step calculation, we ended up with 9841 before the final multiplication by 3, which would be 9841 *3 =29523, which is just one less than 29524.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps there's a miscalculation in the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, let me go back to the step-by-step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*4 =13\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 1:3*(9841)=29523\n\nWait, so according to this, the final result is 29523, which is 3*(9841). But according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 =29524, which would mean that 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which is way larger than our step-by-step result.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps the formula is not being applied correctly. Alternatively, maybe the formula is for a different indexing.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a different starting point. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1 +3 is nested. It's 9 times, as each 1 +3 is inside another 1 +3(...) nine times.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for n layers, so a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So if we have 9 layers, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nBut in our step-by-step, we have 9 layers, each time computing 1 +3*(previous), starting from 4, and ending up at 9841 before the final multiplication by 3, giving 29523.\n\nWait, so 29523 is 3*9841, which is 3*(a_8), where a_8 is (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2=9841. So a_8=9841, then the total expression is 3*a_8 =3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, so in this case, the number of layers is 9, but the index in the formula is n=8, because the innermost is a_1=4, and then each layer adds 1, so after 8 layers, we reach a_8=9841, and then the total expression is 3*a_8=29523.\n\nWait, so the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 gives a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841, which is correct. Then, the total expression is 3*a_8=29523.\n\nBut according to the formula, if we have n=9 layers, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, but in our problem, we have only 9 layers, but the final expression is 3*a_8, not 3*a_9. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indexing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is a_1=4, and each layer adds one more, so the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so total would be 3*29524=88572, which is way bigger than our step-by-step result.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because when I compute step by step, I get 29523, which is 3*9841, where 9841 is a_8=(3^9 -1)/2.\n\nSo perhaps the confusion is in how we count the layers. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 instances of 1 +3. So the number of multiplications by 3 is 9, but the number of additions of 1 is also 9.\n\nWait, but each time you have a 1 +3*(...), so the number of layers is 9. So according to the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and the total expression would be 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut that contradicts the step-by-step calculation, which gives 29523.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the outermost operation is a multiplication by 3, not another 1 +3*(...).\n\nSo perhaps the formula is for when the expression is 1 +3*(1 +3*(...)), but in our case, it's 3*(1 +3*(...)), so the formula would be different.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The problem is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo it's 3 multiplied by (1 +3*(...)), which itself is a similar expression with 8 more layers.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula should be adjusted.\n\nLet me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. So E_1 = 3*(1 +3) =3*4=12.\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(13)=39.\n\nE_3=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*40=120.\n\nWait, so E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1})\n\nWait, that seems different from the previous a_n.\n\nWait, let me define E_n as the entire expression with n layers. So E_1=3*(1+3)=12.\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39.\n\nE_3=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*40=120.\n\nE_4=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))=3*(1 +3*40)=3*121=363.\n\nE_5=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))=3*(1 +3*121)=3*364=1092.\n\nE_6=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))=3*(1 +3*364)=3*1093=3279.\n\nE_7=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))=3*(1 +3*1093)=3*3280=9840.\n\nE_8=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))=3*(1 +3*3280)=3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, so E_8=29523, which matches our step-by-step calculation.\n\nSo in this case, E_n =3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), with E_1=12.\n\nLet me see if there's a formula for E_n.\n\nWe have E_n =3*(1 +3*E_{n-1})=3 +9*E_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence: E_n =9*E_{n-1} +3, with E_1=12.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: E_n^{(h)}=C*9^{n}.\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume E_n^{(p)}=A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA=9*A +3 => A -9A=3 => -8A=3 => A= -3/8.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n=C*9^{n} -3/8.\n\nApply initial condition E_1=12:\n\n12=C*9^1 -3/8 =>12=9C -3/8 =>9C=12 +3/8=96/8 +3/8=99/8 =>C=(99/8)/9=11/8.\n\nThus, E_n=(11/8)*9^{n} -3/8.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1:\n\nE_1=(11/8)*9 -3/8=(99/8 -3/8)=96/8=12. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11/8)*81 -3/8=(891/8 -3/8)=888/8=111. Wait, but E_2=39, so this is incorrect.\n\nWait, that suggests an error in the solution.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the recurrence solution.\n\nGiven E_n =9*E_{n-1} +3, E_1=12.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)}=C*9^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say E_n^{(p)}=A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA=9*A +3 => A -9A=3 => -8A=3 => A= -3/8.\n\nThus, general solution is E_n=C*9^{n} -3/8.\n\nNow, apply E_1=12:\n\n12=C*9^1 -3/8 =>12=9C -3/8.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n9C=12 +3/8= (96/8 +3/8)=99/8 => C= (99/8)/9=11/8.\n\nThus, E_n=(11/8)*9^{n} -3/8.\n\nWait, but when n=2, E_2 should be 39, but according to the formula:\n\nE_2=(11/8)*81 -3/8= (891/8 -3/8)=888/8=111, which is not 39. So there's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the particular solution is not a constant. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the particular solution should be of the form A*n + B, since the homogeneous solution is exponential and the nonhomogeneous term is constant.\n\nLet me assume E_n^{(p)}=A*n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*n + B=9*(A*(n-1)+B) +3.\n\nExpanding RHS:9A(n-1)+9B +3=9An -9A +9B +3.\n\nSo equation: A*n + B=9An -9A +9B +3.\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nFor n: A=9A => -8A=0 => A=0.\n\nFor constants: B= -9A +9B +3. Since A=0, this becomes B=0 +9B +3 => B -9B=3 => -8B=3 => B= -3/8.\n\nThus, the particular solution is E_n^{(p)}=0*n -3/8= -3/8.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n=C*9^{n} -3/8.\n\nNow, apply E_1=12:\n\n12=C*9^1 -3/8 =>12=9C -3/8.\n\nSo 9C=12 +3/8=96/8 +3/8=99/8 => C=11/8.\n\nThus, E_n=(11/8)*9^{n} -3/8.\n\nWait, but when n=2, E_2= (11/8)*81 -3/8= (891/8 -3/8)=888/8=111, which doesn't match our earlier calculation of E_2=39.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the recurrence. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem is E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}).\n\nWait, no, actually, in our earlier step-by-step, E_1=3*(1 +3)=12.\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*(1 +36)=3*37=111.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step calculation, we had E_2=39, which was wrong. Wait, no, wait: when I calculated step-by-step earlier, I think I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each 1+3 is a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:3*(1 +3*9841)=3*(1 +29523)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but that contradicts our earlier step-by-step where we had 3*(1 +3*...)=29523.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 +3), which is 4.\n\nThen each layer is 1 +3*(previous).\n\nSo:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that's different from our initial step-by-step where we thought the final result was 29523. So where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nWait, in the initial step-by-step, I stopped at Layer 8:9841 and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, but that's incorrect because the expression continues one more layer.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(...)), where the innermost is (1 +3), so we have 9 layers of 1 +3*(...), and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds one more 1 +3*(...), so Layer 9 would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9=1 +3*Layer8=1 +3*9841=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts our earlier step-by-step where we thought the final result was 29523. So perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 +3) is the innermost, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: (1 +3(...)) nine times.\n\nSo that means there are 9 layers of 1 +3*(...), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo Layer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's the correct result. But earlier, I thought the result was 29523, which was incorrect because I stopped at Layer 8 and multiplied by 3, but actually, the expression has one more layer.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? Let me check.\n\nIn the initial step-by-step, I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 8), but that's incorrect because the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9=1 +3*Layer8.\n\nSo the correct result is 88572.\n\nBut that contradicts the initial step-by-step where I thought the result was 29523. So I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each layer clearly.\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen total expression:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 29523, but that was because I stopped at Layer 8 and multiplied by 3, not realizing that there's one more layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 1 +3 terms.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 +3(\" adds a new layer. So starting from the innermost, each \"1 +3\" is a new layer.\n\nSo let me count the number of \"1 +3(\":\n\nStarting from the first ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 +3(\n2. (1 +3(\n3. (1 +3(\n4. (1 +3(\n5. (1 +3(\n6. (1 +3(\n7. (1 +3(\n8. (1 +3(\n9. (1 +3(\n\nSo that's 9 layers of \"1 +3(\", each nested within the previous one. So Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nThus, Layer 9 is 1 +3*Layer8=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo the correct answer is 8"

Let me try to parse this. It looks like each layer is 3 times (1 plus 3 times something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so now I can replace that innermost part with 4. Let me go one step out.\n\nNow, the next layer is 3(1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, let me see. Let me count the number of layers. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that the innermost part is 1+3, then each layer wraps around with 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, from the expression, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, so I think there are nine layers. Let me confirm:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n2. The innermost is the last (1+3), then each step out adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4.

So:\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*4\n\nFirst, compute 3*4 = 12, then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Step 2 result is 13.\n\nNext layer out is again 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So:\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 3 result is 40.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 4 result is 121.\n\nContinuing this way, let's proceed.\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 5 result is 364.\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 6 result is 1093.\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 7 result is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 8 result is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nStep 9 result is 29524.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result from Step 9.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*29524\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, in Step 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\nx     3\n\n--------\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps before, let me recap:\n\nStep 1: 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step follows correctly. So, I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the innermost expression and substituting it into the next outer layer until the entire expression is evaluated. \n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2.

    "text": " It looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, so I see a bunch of nested parentheses here. It's like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Since it's all nested, the innermost part is the first place I should start working from. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nLet me write this out as a series of operations, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. So, the innermost part is 1+3. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. It looks like there are nine layers in total because I can count the number of opening parentheses, which is nine. So, let me list them out one by one.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the result of the innermost parentheses worked out step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should index the layers differently. Let me try again.\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 2):\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing this way, Layer 4 would be:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3 multiplied by the entire expression, so that would be 3*(Layer 9). But wait, in my earlier breakdown, I thought of Layer 9 as the innermost expression, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times we have 1 + 3(...).\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression, which is Layer 9.\n\nSo, the total would be 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1)\n3. 1+3(2)\n4. 1+3(3)\n5. 1+3(4)\n6. 1+3(5)\n7. 1+3(6)\n8. 1+3(7)\n9. 1+3(8)\n10. 1+3(9)\nWait, but actually, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, but the last one is 1+3, without another (. So, actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...) before the outermost 3*(...). So, that means the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 up to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so in my earlier calculation, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting with 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc., up to Layer 9 being 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the number of layers again. Maybe I miscounted. Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a new ( after 1+3, that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers inside. So, perhaps I have 9 layers inside, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, that would mean that the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 up to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing the 9th term without having to compute each step manually.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier by step-by-step computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with the formula. Alternatively, maybe we can express the entire expression in terms of the formula.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as above. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 59049 * 3 = 177147\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without having to compute each layer step by step. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, we get a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer step by step again, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Okay, so the structure is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus 3 times another something, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me count how many times this happens. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 seems to start a new layer, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost part, I think I should work my way outwards, solving the innermost parentheses first and then moving outward.

Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer9.\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3*(Layer9). So, that would be 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm including the outermost 3 as Layer10? Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3*(...\" inside.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous_layer).\n\nSo, Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me write out each step clearly.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check this because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me see how many layers there are. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each time you have a new opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses. Wait, no, let me count:\n\nStarting after the initial 3, each \"(\" is an opening parenthesis:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have \"(\", then inside that is another \"(\", and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, let me see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. So, 9 layers. So, the outermost layer would be Layer9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer9 being 36084, and then multiplied by 3 to get 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication for Layer9 again: 12028 * 3.\n\n12028 * 3:\n\n12000*3 = 36000.\n\n28*3 = 84.\n\nSo, 36000 + 84 = 36084. Correct.\n\nThen, 36084 * 3:\n\n36000*3 = 108000.\n\n84*3 = 252.\n\nSo, 108000 + 252 = 108252. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: \"(\"\n2. Inside that: \"(\"\n3. Inside that: \"(\"\n4. Inside that: \"(\"\n5. Inside that: \"(\"\n6. Inside that: \"(\"\n7. Inside that: \"(\"\n8. Inside that: \"(\"\n9. Inside that: \"(\"\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. So, Layer1 to Layer9, with Layer9 being the outermost. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the number of operations can be tricky. Let me try a different approach, perhaps using a formula for such expressions.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let's see if we can find a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nWe can write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 3.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2.\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check if this formula holds for the earlier terms.\n\nFor example, n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in the multiplication when I calculated 3*36084.\n\n36084 * 3:\n\n36,000 * 3 = 108,000.\n\n84 * 3 = 252.\n\nAdding together: 108,000 + 252 = 108,252.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each layer, verifying each step, and even deriving a closed-form formula to confirm the result, I'm confident that the solution is 108,252.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and applying each layer step by step, we find that the value of the expression is 108,252.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). The innermost layer is (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108,252.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{108252}"

    "text": " It's this expression with a bunch of nested parentheses and 3s. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. Let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Hmm, starting from the innermost part, each time it's 3 times something in parentheses. I think there are nine sets of parentheses here, so I guess I need to work from the inside out, right?\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. Maybe I'll start by solving the innermost parentheses first and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so now I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Let me rewrite the expression with that substitution:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next innermost parentheses is 1 + 3(1 + 4). Wait, no, actually, after the first substitution, the next innermost would be the next set of parentheses. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider each substitution step by step, moving from the innermost to the outermost. Let me number the parentheses for clarity.\n\nLet me label each set of parentheses from the innermost as step 1, then step 2, and so on until step 9, since there are nine sets.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving out one level, we have 1 + 3(4). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3(4) = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, after step 2, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 13)))))))))\n\nStep 3: Next innermost is 1 + 3(13). Let's compute that.\n\n3(13) = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, now the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 40)))))))\n\nStep 4: Next, compute 1 + 3(40).\n\n3(40) = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 121)))))))\n\nStep 5: Now, compute 1 + 3(121).\n\n3(121) = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nExpression now is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 364)))))))\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3(364).\n\n3(364) = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 1093)))))))\n\nStep 7: Next, compute 1 + 3(1093).\n\n3(1093) = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNow, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3280)))))))\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3(3280).\n\n3(3280) = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nExpression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 9841)))))))\n\nStep 9: Now, compute 1 + 3(9841).\n\n3(9841) = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, now the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 29524)))))))\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the steps because I'm still at step 9, but I have more parentheses to compute. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, each step I'm computing one layer, so after step 9, I should be done, but maybe I'm missing a step. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each step more carefully. Let me try again, perhaps I missed a layer.\n\nWait, let me see. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 sets of parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me number them from the innermost as step 1 to step 9.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next layer is 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer is 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next layer is 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Next layer is 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer is 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer is 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after computing the innermost parentheses all the way out, the entire expression inside the outermost 3( ... ) is 29524.\n\nSo, now I just need to compute 3 times 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 \u00d7 29524.\n\nFirst, compute 3 \u00d7 20000 = 60000.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 9000 = 27000. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, that's 20000 + 9000 = 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 is 3 \u00d7 (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n3 \u00d7 20000 = 60000\n\n3 \u00d7 9000 = 27000\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1500\n\n3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps when I was computing each layer. Sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the steps, which would throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent each time. So, I think my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to compute each step manually, which might help verify the result.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested multiplications by 3 and additions of 1. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each step as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 is the innermost value, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081.\n\nSimilarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers.\n\nSo, each term is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40.\n\nAnd so on up to a\u2089.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form expression for a\u2099.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is:\n\na\u2099 = A \u00d7 3\u207f + B,\n\nwhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, we can solve for A and B.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, whose solution is A \u00d7 3\u207f.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a\u2099 = A \u00d7 3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A \u00d7 3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general term is a\u2099 = (3/2) \u00d7 3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a\u2089 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier after computing each step manually. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 a\u2089 = 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each step manually and by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue substituting and computing each layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nTo verify, we recognize the expression as a recursive sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times the previous term. Using the closed-form formula for the sequence, we find that the innermost value after 9 layers is 29524, leading to the final result.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I need to compute the value step by step. The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's quite a few layers! Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with nested expressions like this, the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. That way, each step simplifies the expression a bit more until we reach the final answer.\n\nSo, looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3( result from the innermost layer ). Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure. The expression after the first innermost is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the second layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is indeed 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*(40). Hmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nWait, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. That's correct.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nWait, 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Correct.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364 first. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so total is 900 + 180 = 1080 +12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nWait, that's a big number, but I think that's correct.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so total is 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 is 29520, +3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, so the ninth layer is 29524.\n\nNow, finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because I don't want to make a mistake in any layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\n3. 1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\n4. 1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\n5. 1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\n6. 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\n7. 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\n8. 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\n9. 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\n10. 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each adding a 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, that would be 9 layers inside and then the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of '1 + 3(' starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, each layer wraps around:\n\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until the ninth layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) nine times, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my computation, I went through nine layers inside and then the outermost 3*(...). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the layers, I had nine layers inside, each step being 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct, ending up with 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 =1, and then the expression is 3*a_9, since there are nine layers inside.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Let me define a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_0 =1.\n\nThen, a_1 =1 + 3*a_0 =1 +3*1=4.\n\na_2 =1 +3*a_1=1+12=13.\n\na_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40.\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1+120=121.\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1+363=364.\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1+1092=1093.\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1+3279=3280.\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1+9840=9841.\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D -3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_0=1:\n\n1 = C*3^0 -1/2 => 1 = C -1/2 => C= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step and even found a general formula, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the result is used in the next outer layer until the entire expression is simplified. The final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**: Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Second Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Third Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Fourth Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Fifth Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Sixth Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Seventh Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Eighth Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Ninth Layer**: Compute 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Outermost Layer**: Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " It's this expression with a bunch of nested parentheses and multiplying by 3 each time. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. So, starting from the inside:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check. Each time I compute a parentheses, I should replace it and then move one step out. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) which is 4. So, the next layer out is (1 + 3(4)).\n\nSo, let's compute that next layer: (1 + 3*4).\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo now, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have 13 in the next layer. Let me compute the next outer parentheses: (1 + 3*13).\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nReplacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))\n\nContinuing this way, next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that.\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nReplacing that, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))\n\nWait, no, let me check. It's (1 + 3*121). So, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\nWait, no, again, I think I might be skipping a step. Let me make sure I'm replacing correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track each step carefully, maybe even number them. Let me try that.\n\nLet me label each step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. Compute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check each step again because I might have made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7.

(1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each step seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, if I denote each step as a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term, then starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nTerm 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nTerm 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nTerm 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nTerm 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nTerm 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nTerm 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nTerm 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nTerm 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nTerm 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested sequence. Let me see.\n\nIf I have a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost term is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, in general, for such a linear recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, the solution can be found using the formula for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where B is a particular solution.\n\nIn our case, k = 3, c = 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = 13.\n\n(3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers of nesting, starting from a_1 up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each step, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but having a formula is useful for deeper nesting.\n\nIn any case, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3.

Substitute and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's break it down step by step. I'll start from the very inside and move out, simplifying each part as I go.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression now becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me check. The innermost was the last (1 + 3), so the one before that would be 3(1 + 3(...)), so yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next innermost expression is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. Wait, no, actually, it's 3 times (1 + something). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should label each step with numbers to keep track. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1 result) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So perhaps I should compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try again, more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer's result).\n\nSo perhaps each layer is computed as 3*(1 + previous layer's result). Let me try that.\n\nLet me list each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer, and each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer. So there are 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, let me write each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check each calculation again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let's compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24, so 300+120=420+24=444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 45*3=135, so 1200+135=1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3:\n\n1000*3=3000\n\n300*3=900\n\n30*3=90\n\n6*3=18\n\nAdd them up: 3000 + 900 = 3900; 3900 + 90 = 3990; 3990 + 18 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3:\n\n4000*3=12000\n\n9*3=27\n\nSo 12000 + 27 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3:\n\n12000*3=36000\n\n28*3=84\n\nSo 36000 + 84 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing it another way or seeing if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each layer is following a pattern where each result is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from 4, each step is 3*(1 + previous). Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recurrence.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3(a_{n-1} + c). Let's set up the equation:\n\na_n + c = 3(a_{n-1} + c)\n\nBut since a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), we can write:\n\n3*(1 + a_{n-1}) + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c)\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n3 + 3a_{n-1} + c = 3a_{n-1} + 3c\n\nSubtract 3a_{n-1} from both sides:\n\n3 + c = 3c\n\nSo, 3 = 2c \u21d2 c = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = 3^n * k + 3/2, where k is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nUsing a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = 3^1 * k + 3/2 \u21d2 4 = 3k + 1.5 \u21d2 3k = 4 - 1.5 = 2.5 \u21d2 k = 2.5 / 3 = 5/6.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 3^n*(5/6) + 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (5/6)*3^n + 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (5*3^{n}) / 6 + 3/2.\n\nSimplify further:\n\na_n = (5*3^{n} + 9) / 6.\n\nWait, let's check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (5*3 + 9)/6 = (15 + 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (5*9 + 9)/6 = (45 + 9)/6 = 54/6 = 9. Wait, but earlier we had a_2 as 15. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps my approach was wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can write a_n = 3 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 3 \u21d2 -2K = 3 \u21d2 K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1.5 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 \u21d2 C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula checks out for each layer up to n=9, which is our desired result.\n\nTherefore, the final value after computing all layers is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed each layer step by step, checked each multiplication, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So I'm confident that 36,084 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n5.

And so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, let's go step by step.\n\n**Layer 1:**\nCompute the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2:**\nNow, moving out one layer, we have:\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that:\n3*4 = 12\n1 + 12 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3:**\nNext layer out:\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating:\n3*13 = 39\n1 + 39 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4:**\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120\n1 + 120 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5:**\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363\n1 + 363 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6:**\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 = 1092\n1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:**\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 = 3279\n1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:**\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 = 9840\n1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:**\n1 + 3*(result from Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 = Let me compute that: 9841 * 3. \n\n9841 * 3:\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 800 * 3 = 2400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\nAdding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n**Layer 10:**\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that:\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break that down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 10:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. Layer 10: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. Let me verify the final multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3 can be computed as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That also checks out.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I need to compute the value step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are here. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time we add another 1 + 3(...). Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...), so by the time we get to the outermost, it's the ninth layer. So, I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me write each step down, starting from the innermost:\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Step 2:** Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(result from Step 1)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, yes, each time, it's 1 + 3*(the result from the previous step).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3(...). So, the first layer is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(the inner expression). So, to compute each layer, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that becomes the new result.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from previous step), and so on.\n\nSo, maybe it's better to think of it as a recursive process, where each layer depends on the previous one. Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, up to E9, where E9 is the outermost expression. Each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1), except for E1, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no. E1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, so E1 = 4.\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on until E9.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again:\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is E9, and so on. So, yes, the outermost layer is 3*E9, where E9 is the result of the innermost expression.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*(E8), and E8 is 1 + 3*(E7), and so on until E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, to compute the entire expression, I need to compute E1 through E9, then multiply the final E9 by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the first multiplication by 3 is outside the entire inner expression. So, yes, the outermost operation is 3*(E9), where E9 is the inner expression.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Compute E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Compute E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Compute E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Compute E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Compute E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Compute E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Compute E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Compute E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLet me go step by step again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the E steps correctly.\n\nE1=4\n\nE2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nE3=1 +3*13=40\n\nE4=1 +3*40=121\n\nE5=1 +3*121=364\n\nE6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. It looks like each step is a recurrence relation: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition. When n=1, E1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\nE9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nBut since the problem asks to compute it step by step, I think the first method is more appropriate, but it's good to verify with the formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but given that it's only 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. Let me recompute each E step:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps are correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's quite a few layers! Let me see how I can tackle this. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each set starts with a 1, then adds 3 multiplied by another expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, I'll start from the innermost part and move outward, simplifying each layer as I go.\n\nLet me number each layer for clarity. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me compute each layer one by one.\n\n**Layer 1: 1 + 3**\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nLayer 1 = 4\n\n**Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4**\n\nCompute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then add 1.\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 2 = 13\n\n**Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13**\n\nCompute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 = 40\n\n**Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40**\n\nCompute 3*40: that's 120.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 = 121\n\n**Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121**\n\nCompute 3*121. Hmm, 121 is 120 + 1, so 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3. So, 360 + 3 = 363.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 = 364\n\n**Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364**\n\nCompute 3*364. Let's break it down: 364 is 300 + 64. So, 3*300 = 900, and 3*64 = 192. Adding those together: 900 + 192 = 1092.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 = 1093\n\n**Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093**\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's see, 1093 is 1000 + 93. So, 3*1000 = 3000, and 3*93 = 279. Adding them gives 3000 + 279 = 3279.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 = 3280\n\n**Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280**\n\nCompute 3*3280. 3280 is 3000 + 280. So, 3*3000 = 9000, and 3*280 = 840. Adding them: 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 = 9841\n\n**Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841**\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9841 is 9000 + 841. So, 3*9000 = 27000, and 3*841. Hmm, 841 is 800 + 41. So, 3*800 = 2400, and 3*41 = 123. Adding those: 2400 + 123 = 2523. Now, add 27000 + 2523: 27000 + 2000 = 29000, 29000 + 523 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll steps seem correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that requires simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, so I need to take it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me try to break it down from the innermost parentheses outward. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the inside and work your way out. So, let's identify where the innermost part is.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another expression: 1 + 3( that result ). So, the next step is to compute 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. So, inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4). So, 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we're moving one step out, multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to list these steps systematically to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me number the levels from the innermost to the outermost as Level 1 to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3s before each parenthesis: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine layers. So, let's go step by step from Level 1 to Level 9.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. Because the original expression is 3 times the entire expression starting from the first parenthesis. So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Level 9, which gives 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Wait, no, actually, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me parse the expression again carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). But wait, the outermost is 3*(entire expression). So, perhaps I need to compute the innermost first, then each layer, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the levels. Let me try to write the expression step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is computed as 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost.\n\nLet\u2019s define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, if a_9 is the result of the innermost expression, then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 would be the final result.\n\nWait, but let me check: When I computed a_9, I thought that was the innermost expression, but perhaps I misapplied the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...) and so on, and finally, the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous value). So, let's compute each step:\n\nLet me list them as a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nWait, from a_8: 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3 = 24 +1 = 25 \u21925, carry 2.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u21929, carry 2.\n\nNo more digits, so 2 carried over becomes 2.\n\nSo, 9841 *3 = 29523.\n\nThen, a_9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's see how many times we have 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is applied:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify each step once more to be sure.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me see if that applies here.\n\nWait, for n=1, a_1=4. Let's see:\n\n(3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe my formula is off.\n\nWait, let's try solving the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found as a constant. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A =1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as above.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't find any errors in the calculations, and the alternative method using the recurrence relation formula gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each level starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost level: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next level: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost expression up to the ninth level, we get the result 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I need to compute the value step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's quite a few layers. It looks like each layer is another set of parentheses where we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. I'll start from the very inside and compute each part one by one.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, let me check that. The very innermost part is the last (1 + 3). So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is the last (1 + 3), which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result of the innermost. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list the layers from innermost to outermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = (1 + 3*4)\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1 + 3(...)), there are 9 layers because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the last one ends with (1 + 3). So, 9 layers in total.\n\nLet me assign each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8), and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer9, we'll multiply that result by 3.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nI can compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to miscompute a layer.\n\nLet me verify each layer again.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize that this is a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of expression.\n\nLet me think about that. The expression is of the form:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...)))\n\nWhich is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\na3 =1 +3*a2=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a9, which we found to be 29524.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recursive sequence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*r^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nIn this case, r=3, c=1.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since c is a constant, assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1.\n\nSolving for B: B -3B =1 \u2192 -2B=1 \u2192 B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. The first term a1=4.\n\nSo, a1 = A*3^1 -1/2 =3A -1/2=4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this method also gives the same result, confirming that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which is similar to base 3 numbers or something, but the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be modeled using a geometric series. Solving this step by step or using the recurrence relation both lead to the same result.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me see how I can tackle this. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Let's compute that first. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let me replace the innermost part with the result I just got.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12, then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now that part simplifies to 13. Let me go another layer out.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So 1 + 3*13. Compute 3*13 first: 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit bigger each time. Let's keep going.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). So 3*40 is 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 121? That's a nice number, a perfect square. Interesting.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute 3*121 first. 121*3 is 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). So 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's a big number. Let me make sure I did that right. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Yeah, that's correct. Then 1092 + 1 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093: Let me check that again. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 3279 + 1 is 3280. Yep, that seems right.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, 3*3280: Let me compute that differently. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So yes, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 9840 + 1 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 29523 + 1 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Let's compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n- 20000*3=60000\n- 9000*3=27000\n- 500*3=1500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me recap all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations. So, I think 88572 is the right answer.\n\nI guess another way to approach this is to recognize a pattern or a formula, but since it's only 9 layers deep, manually computing each step might be the most straightforward way. If it were deeper, maybe I could find a geometric series or something, but here, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can compute it from another angle. Let me try to see if each step is correct.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5.

Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(4)).\n\nCompute inside first: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nSo, that's the result of the second level.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(39)).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 3*39 = 1 + 117 = 118.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*118 = 354.\n\nThird level done.\n\nNext level out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*354).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 3*354 = 1 + 1062 = 1063.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nFourth level.\n\nNext level:\n\n3*(1 + 3*3189).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 3*3189 = 1 + 9567 = 9568.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nFifth level.\n\nNext level:\n\n3*(1 + 3*28704).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 3*28704 = 1 + 86112 = 86113.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*86113 = 258339.\n\nSixth level.\n\nNext level:\n\n3*(1 + 3*258339).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 3*258339 = 1 + 775017 = 775018.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*775018 = 2325054.\n\nSeventh level.\n\nNext level:\n\n3*(1 + 3*2325054).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 3*2325054 = 1 + 6975162 = 6975163.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*6975163 = 20925489.\n\nEighth level.\n\nNext level:\n\n3*(1 + 3*20925489).\n\nCompute inside: 1 + 3*20925489 = 1 + 62776467 = 62776468.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*62776468 = 188329404.\n\nNinth level.\n\nWait, but now I'm at the ninth level, which is the outermost parentheses. So, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the levels correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses inside the outermost 3, right? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each 3*(1 + ...) adds another level. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3*\" is a level, and there are 9 such levels inside the outermost 3. So, yes, 9 levels, which I computed correctly.\n\nTherefore, the result is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is computed by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3189\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 28704\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 258339\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 2325054\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 20925489\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 188329404\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{188329404}$"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me write it down to get a better look:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. I think I'll need to solve this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually seems to work with these kinds of expressions.\n\nOkay, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first.\n\nFirst step:\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, that was the innermost part. Let me replace that in the expression. So, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost was (1 + 3), so the next layer is 1 + 3*(result). So, maybe I should handle each layer one by one.\n\nLet me try to break it down layer by layer. There are nine layers of 3 multiplied by something. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Hmm, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3 multiplied by a sum, which itself contains another sum. So, maybe I can work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list the layers from the innermost to the outermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\n... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, the problem has 9 layers because each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step is (1 + 3*(...)). So, if I have 9 layers, I need to compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer as I compute it.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. That seems like a lot, but let me check each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 gives us 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it makes sense. Let me double-check the multiplication:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost (Layer 1) as (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 introduces a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, each followed by a (1 + ...). Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is 3(1 + ...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s. So, total layers would be 9, right? Because each 3 corresponds to a layer.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I had Layer 1 as (1 + 3), and Layer 9 as the outermost. So, that aligns with 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, the final result after 9 layers is 29524, and then multiplied by the initial 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step checks out. I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's a recurrence relation. But since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by the outermost 3:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, so I need to take it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's quite a few 3s and parentheses! Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up from the inside out, with each step adding another layer of multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. That makes sense because in order to solve expressions with parentheses, we always start with the innermost ones.\n\nLet me write down the expression again for clarity:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving out each layer.\n\nLet me label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. That might help me keep track.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nBut wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the outermost operation is multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis, so let me count the number of times that happens.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 inside another parenthesis. So, starting from the first 3, then each 3 is inside another set. Let me see:\n\n- The first term is 3*(...), so that's Layer 9? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, calculating each step as I go.\n\nSo, let's start at the very inside.\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nBecause 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nBecause 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nBecause 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nBecause 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841.\n\nSo, Layer 9: 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*9841: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*800 = 2400\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29523.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 29523.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the last step where I just multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula here that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in our case, the outermost operation is 3*a_9, not a_10.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThis recursive relation is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p is a constant. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWait, but earlier I computed a_9 as 9841, which was before multiplying by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I confused the layers.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step calculation, I had Layer 1 through Layer 9, with Layer 9 being the outermost, which was 3*(Layer 8). But in the recurrence, a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, does that correspond to a_9?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = a_1\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*a_1 = a_2\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*a_8 = a_9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, so in the recurrence, a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8, and the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, according to the recurrence, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut wait, that's conflicting with my initial step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 29523.\n\nSo, something is wrong here. There must be a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's check the recurrence.\n\nIf a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had the innermost as 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, until I reached Layer 8 as 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523.\n\nWait, so in the initial approach, I considered the outermost operation as multiplying by 3, which would be 3*(Layer 8), but according to the recurrence, the layers go up to a_9, which is 1 + 3*a_8, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nExpression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"3(\" appears.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3))\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"3(\", meaning 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except the outermost which is just multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but in the recurrence, a_n corresponds to the expression after n layers, starting from a_1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9, which is 1 + 3*a_8.\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, according to the recurrence, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so in this approach, I only went up to Layer 8 and then multiplied by 3, but according to the recurrence, it should be up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the discrepancy is because in the recurrence, a_n is defined as the expression after n layers, which includes the 1 + 3*... So, in the initial step-by-step, I stopped at Layer 8 and then multiplied by 3, which would correspond to 3*a_8, but according to the recurrence, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, meaning that the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, in the recurrence, a_n corresponds to Layer n, which is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nTherefore, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9\n\nSo, according to the recurrence, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n\nThus, total expression = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 8 as 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523, which is different.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute a_9 using the recurrence.\n\nFrom a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, so a_9 = 29524\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at Layer 8 and multiplied by 3, getting 3*9841 = 29523\n\nSo, the confusion is whether the total expression is 3*a_9 or 3*a_8.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression.\n\nThe nested expression is: 1 + 3*(...), which is a_9\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9\n\nThus, the correct value should be 3*a_9 = 88572\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I thought the outermost was 3*(Layer 8), but that's incorrect.\n\nInstead, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is a_9 = 29524\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572\n\nWait, but let's verify this by computing step-by-step again, but this time making sure to go all the way to Layer 9.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my initial mistake was stopping at Layer 8 and multiplying by 3, but actually, the structure of the expression requires going one layer further to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's compute it manually step by step without using the recurrence.\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, to verify, let's compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, so the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think my initial confusion was whether the outermost operation was 3*(Layer 8) or 3*(Layer 9). But upon careful analysis, it's 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

It looks like each layer is 3 multiplied by something inside parentheses, which itself contains another similar expression. So, this seems like a nested expression where each step involves computing the innermost parentheses first and working our way outwards.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. I'll start from the innermost part and work my way outward. So, the innermost expression is:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward.

Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, the final result is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Substitute and compute the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer, resulting in the final value after all substitutions and computations.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{797160}"

It seems like each step involves multiplying the result of the innermost parentheses by 3 and then adding 1.

The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3 * 4, which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that part simplifies to 13. Now, moving another step out, the next expression is (1 + 3(13)).

That's interesting. Let me note that down. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3(121)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, that's 364.

Yes, that's correct. So, 1 + 1092 is indeed 1093.\n\nMoving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3(1093)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 1093. Hmm, let's break that down: 3 * 1000 = 3000, 3 * 93 = 279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3 * 93 is 279? Let me check: 90 * 3 is 270, 3 * 3 is 9, so yes, 270 + 9 is 279. So, 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3(3280)). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 3280. Let's compute that: 3 * 3000 = 9000, 3 * 280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, 3 * 280 is 840? Let me confirm: 200 * 3 = 600, 80 * 3 = 240, so 600 + 240 = 840. Yes, that's correct. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3(9841)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 9841. Hmm, let's break that down: 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 800 = 2400, 3 * 41 = 123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication step by step. 9841 * 3: 9000 * 3 is 27000, 800 * 3 is 2400, 40 * 3 is 120, and 1 * 3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3(29524)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3 * 29524: 20000 * 3 is 60000, 9000 * 3 is 27000, 500 * 3 is 1500, 24 * 3 is 72. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3(88573)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 88573. Let me compute that: 3 * 80000 = 240000, 3 * 8000 = 24000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 73 = 219. So, adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 219 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. 3 * 88573: 80000 * 3 = 240000, 8000 * 3 = 24000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 70 * 3 = 210, and 3 * 3 = 9. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3, right? So, 3 * 70 is 210, not 219. So, 3 * 73 is actually 219, because 70 * 3 is 210, and 3 * 3 is 9, so 210 + 9 is 219. So, that part is correct. So, 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 219 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. Correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3(265720)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 265720. Let me compute that: 3 * 200000 = 600000, 3 * 60000 = 180000, 3 * 5000 = 15000, 3 * 700 = 2100, 3 * 20 = 60. So, adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that. 265720 * 3: 200000 * 3 = 600000, 60000 * 3 = 180000, 5000 * 3 = 15000, 700 * 3 = 2100, 20 * 3 = 60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 = 795000, plus 2100 = 797100, plus 60 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. Correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3(797161)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 797161. Hmm, let's compute that step by step. 700000 * 3 = 2100000, 90000 * 3 = 270000, 7000 * 3 = 21000, 100 * 3 = 300, 60 * 3 = 180, 1 * 3 = 3. So, adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 = 2391000, plus 300 = 2391300, plus 180 = 2391480, plus 3 = 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 797161 * 3: 700000 * 3 is 2100000, 90000 * 3 is 270000, 7000 * 3 is 21000, 100 * 3 is 300, 60 * 3 is 180, and 1 * 3 is 3. So, 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 = 2391000, plus 300 = 2391300, plus 180 = 2391480, plus 3 = 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 is 2391484. Correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3(2391484)). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 2391484. Let me compute that: 2000000 * 3 = 6000000, 300000 * 3 = 900000, 90000 * 3 = 270000, 1000 * 3 = 3000, 400 * 3 = 1200, 80 * 3 = 240, 4 * 3 = 12. So, adding them up: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 = 7170000, plus 3000 = 7173000, plus 1200 = 7174200, plus 240 = 7174440, plus 12 = 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 2391484 * 3: 2000000 * 3 = 6000000, 300000 * 3 = 900000, 90000 * 3 = 270000, 1000 * 3 = 3000, 400 * 3 = 1200, 80 * 3 = 240, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me write it down to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested expressions. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, each time I see a 1 + 3, and then that gets multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer adds another 3 multiplication. Let me see, how many times does this happen?\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer wraps another 3(1 + ...) around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. From the expression, I can see that there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So that means there are 9 layers of multiplication by 3, each time adding 1 + 3 to the previous result.\n\nSo maybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems manageable. Let me try that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(...), so each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. So perhaps it's better to think of each step as:\n\nStart with the innermost expression, compute it, then plug that into the next layer, and so on until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo reading the numbers from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, that gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute it without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo for layer n=9, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then noticed a pattern and used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed the result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step. Each layer follows the pattern of adding 1 and multiplying by 3, leading to a geometric progression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately resulting in the final value after multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), multiplied by 3 at the outermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Layer:**\n   - Final Result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to compute 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I stopped at Layer 9 as 29524, but actually, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524).\n\nSo, let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again because 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841, that's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n= ?\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n= 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

I think I need to solve this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll count how many layers there are.

Let me go through each layer again quickly to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3\u00d74=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3\u00d713=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3\u00d740=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3\u00d7previous result, which seems to be a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where i is from 1 to 9.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3\u00d7a1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3\u00d7a2 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A\u00d73^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C\u00d73^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3\u00d7K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C\u00d73^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition at n=1: a1=4.\n\nSo 4 = C\u00d73^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for layer 9, n=9:\n\na9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3\u00d7a9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, so both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

Since it's a series of nested expressions, I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting confused.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3. Let me write that down.\n\nFirst step: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3( result from above ). So, let me compute that.\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, hold on. I need to compute 3*(previous result) first, right? Because multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So, 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now that expression simplifies to 13. Let me note that.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\n- 1 + 3 = 4\n- 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNow, moving one more level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's compute that.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*13.\n\nAgain, multiplication first: 3*13 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, I'll keep track of each step:\n\n4.

Next level: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next level: 1 + 3*29524.\n\n3*29524 = 88572, then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\n11. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*(result from above).\n\nSo, 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*88573.\n\nHmm, 3*80000 = 240000\n\n3*8000 = 24000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nWait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let me do it properly.\n\nActually, 88573 can be broken down as 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3.\n\nSo, 3*80000 = 240000\n\n3*8000 = 24000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any errors in the multiplication or addition.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that it's only 9 levels deep, computing each step manually might be more straightforward and less error-prone, especially since I can verify each step as I go.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this process. Each step is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each step as a_i, where i starts from 1.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each a_i follows the recurrence relation:\n\na_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_i = A*3^i + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way.\n\nGiven the recurrence:\n\na_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the solution a_i^{(h)} = C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_i^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_i = C*3^i - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen i = 1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is:\n\na_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each a_i, we have a formula.\n\nIn our problem, starting from a_1, we have 10 levels:\n\nWait, actually, let's count how many a_i's we have.\n\nLooking back, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, each subsequent a_i is built up until the outermost, which is a_10 = 88573\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_10.\n\nGiven that, we can compute a_10 using the formula:\n\na_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nThus, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146 / 2 = 88573\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719\n\nSo, using the formula, we can see that each a_i is (3^{i+1} - 1)/2, which is a much faster way to compute it without having to go through each step manually.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each step manually and verify that it's correct, I can be confident that the final answer is indeed 265,719.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and looked for a pattern or formula to solve it more efficiently. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I feel confident that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. By recognizing the pattern, we can use a formula to find the result more efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a bunch of 1s and 3s. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think I need to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3\", that's one layer, and then it's multiplied by 3 again. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, I have another 1 + 3, but wait, is that correct? Let me look again. Actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the inner expression. Hmm, maybe I need to write this out more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write this as a series of steps, starting from the innermost bracket and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., up to S9, since there are nine layers of 1 + 3 multiplied by 3.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is:\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, that would be 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3(...). So the first layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4), which is 1 + 12 = 13. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nLet me define each step:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 times the entire expression. So after computing S9, which is the innermost expression, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by S9.\n\nWait, let me see: the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So after computing S9, which is the innermost, the next step would be to compute 3*S9, but let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, right? Because each (1 + 3(...) is a layer, and there are nine of them. So starting from the innermost, S1 is 1 + 3, then each subsequent S is 1 + 3*S_prev.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's 3 multiplied by the entire expression, so after computing S9, the total expression is S9, and then the outermost 3 multiplies that. So the final result is 3*S9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, S9 was 29524, so 3*29524 would be 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in my steps. Let me go through each S step again.\n\nStarting over:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI notice that each step is S_{n} = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is S^{(h)}_n = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution S^{(p)}_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nS1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo S9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3^10 is 59049, so S9 is (59049 -1)/2=29524, correct.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers.\n\nBut I think my step-by-step calculation and the formula both lead to the same result.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost is 3*(result of the ninth layer).\n\nSo, using the formula, S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let me compute S9 step by step:\n\nS1 =4\n\nS2=1 +3*4=13\n\nS3=1 +3*13=40\n\nS4=1 +3*40=121\n\nS5=1 +3*121=364\n\nS6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nS7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nS8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nS9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*S9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049, correct.\n\nSo S9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost layer outward.

Let me write it down to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it will make more sense.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so I can replace that part with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Wait, so that's 1 plus 3 times 4. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, I should do the multiplication before the addition. So, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, adding 1 gives me 13. So, that middle part simplifies to 13. Let me write that down.\n\nNow, moving out another level, I have 1 + 3(13). Again, I need to do the multiplication first. 3 times 13 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 40. Okay, so this part simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next level is 1 + 3(40). Let's compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext level up: 1 + 3(121). Hmm, 3 times 121. Let me calculate that. 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3 times 121: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60=360, 360+3=363. Then, 363 +1=364. Yes, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another level: 1 + 3(364). Let's compute 3 times 364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3(1093). Let me compute 3 times 1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280.\n\nAnother level out: 1 + 3(3280). Calculating 3 times 3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841.\n\nNext up: 1 + 3(9841). Let me compute 3 times 9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 9841 times 3: 9*3=27, 8*3=24, 4*3=12, 1*3=3. So, writing it down:\n\n9841\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, adding 1: 29523 +1=29524.\n\nMoving out another level: 1 + 3(29524). Let's compute 3 times 29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me write it out properly.\n\n88573 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n3\u00d73 = 9\n3\u00d77 = 21, write 1, carry over 2\n3\u00d75 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry over 1\n3\u00d78 = 24 +1 =25, write 5, carry over 2\n3\u00d78 =24 +2=26, write 6, carry over 2\n\nWait, but there are no more digits, so we write the carryover 2 before the 6? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the number is 88573, so the digits are 8 (ten thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 3 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n3\u00d73=9 (units)\n3\u00d77=21, write 1, carry 2 (tens)\n3\u00d75=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1 (hundreds)\n3\u00d78=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2 (thousands)\n3\u00d78=24 +2=26, write 6, carry 2 (ten thousands)\nBut there are no more digits, so we write the carryover 2 before the 6. So the result is 265719.\n\nWait, but 88573 \u00d73: Let me compute it differently. 80,000 \u00d73=240,000, 8,000\u00d73=24,000, 500\u00d73=1,500, 70\u00d73=210, 3\u00d73=9. Adding them together:\n\n240,000 +24,000=264,000\n264,000 +1,500=265,500\n265,500 +210=265,710\n265,710 +9=265,719.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 88573 \u00d73=265,719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265,720.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the expression, it's 1 + 3(88573). So, 3\u00d788573=265,719, then adding 1: 265,719 +1=265,720.\n\nOkay, so that part simplifies to 265,720.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost level: 3 times that result. So, 3\u00d7265,720.\n\nLet me compute that. 200,000\u00d73=600,000, 60,000\u00d73=180,000, 5,000\u00d73=15,000, 700\u00d73=2,100, 20\u00d73=60.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to compute 265,720 \u00d73.\n\n265,720 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n0\u00d73=0\n2\u00d73=6\n7\u00d73=21, write 1, carry over 2\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17, write 7, carry over 1\n6\u00d73=18 +1=19, write 9, carry over 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n265,720\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n797,160\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n265,720 \u00d73:\n\n0\u00d73=0\n2\u00d73=6\n7\u00d73=21, write 1, carry 2\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1\n6\u00d73=18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n0\n6\n1 (from 21), carry 2\n7 (from 17), carry 1\n9 (from 19), carry 1\n7 (from 6 +1)\n\nSo, the result is 797,160.\n\nWait, let me confirm with another method. 265,720 \u00d73:\n\n200,000 \u00d73=600,000\n60,000 \u00d73=180,000\n5,000 \u00d73=15,000\n700 \u00d73=2,100\n20 \u00d73=60\n0 \u00d73=0\n\nAdding them together:\n\n600,000 +180,000=780,000\n780,000 +15,000=795,000\n795,000 +2,100=797,100\n797,100 +60=797,160\n797,160 +0=797,160\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3\u00d7265,720=797,160.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times that big nested expression. So, after simplifying all the inner parentheses, we ended up with 265,720, and then we multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3\u00d7265,720=797,160.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me recount the levels:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n2. 1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13\n3. 1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40\n4. 1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121\n5. 1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364\n6. 1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093\n7. 1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280\n8. 1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841\n9. 1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524\n10. 1 +3\u00d729524=1+88572=88573\n11. 1 +3\u00d788573=1+265719=265720\n12. Finally, 3\u00d7265720=797,160\n\nWait, so that's 12 steps, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3) parts: Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time it's 1 +3(...). So, how many times does that happen? Let's count the number of (1+3) inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 (1+3) expressions. So, each step I did above corresponds to each layer.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, I had 11 steps after the initial 3(.... So maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4\n2. Next: 1 +3\u00d74=13\n3. Next: 1 +3\u00d713=40\n4. Next: 1 +3\u00d740=121\n5. Next: 1 +3\u00d7121=364\n6. Next: 1 +3\u00d7364=1093\n7. Next: 1 +3\u00d71093=3280\n8. Next: 1 +3\u00d73280=9841\n9. Next: 1 +3\u00d79841=29524\n10. Next: 1 +3\u00d729524=88573\n11. Next: 1 +3\u00d788573=265720\n12. Finally, multiply by 3: 3\u00d7265720=797,160\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 797,160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Sometimes when doing multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 1 +3\u00d729524=1+88572=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n11. 1 +3\u00d788573=1+265719=265720 \u2714\ufe0f\n12. 3\u00d7265720=797,160 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll steps check out. So, the final answer is 797,160.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that it's only 9 layers, it's manageable to compute step by step as I did.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each step is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7(previous result). So, starting from 4, each step is 1 + 3\u00d7(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nI think I've done it correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few steps again.\n\nFor example, step 5: 1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 6: 1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 7: 1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 8: 1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 9: 1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 10: 1 +3\u00d729524=1+88572=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 11: 1 +3\u00d788573=1+265719=265720 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 12: 3\u00d7265720=797,160 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, everything adds up. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence of additions and multiplications. By systematically simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward, each step involves computing the innermost expression and substituting it into the next level until the entire expression is simplified. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n10. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\)\n11. Substitute back: \\(1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\)\n12. Finally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 265720 = 797160\\)\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{797160}$"

Let me write it out again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but it's done multiple times. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me label each part to keep track. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving outwards, each step will take the result from the previous step, multiply by 3, add 1, and then use that in the next parentheses.\n3. I'll do this repeatedly until I reach the outermost part.\n\nLet me start:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me check that. I think I might have miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount the number of times the pattern repeats.\n\nLooking back, the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(result). So, I need to compute this 9 times, each time using the result from the previous step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a recursive expression. Let me define it as such.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1), and so on, up to f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(...). So, the outermost multiplication by 3 is applied after computing all the inner layers. So, if I compute f(9) as the innermost expression, then multiply by 3, that would give me the result.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure it as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1) = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer).

That's correct.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Use this result in the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer.\n4. After computing the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up from the inside out, with each layer being 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and working my way outwards.\n\nLet me write down each step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That should make it manageable.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3 * (Layer 1) + 1\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(previous layer) + 1? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, looking at the problem:\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo each time, you have 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next inner expression). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the next layer is 3*(Layer 1). But looking at the structure, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from Layer 1, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). Wait, no, that's not correct because the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, that seems too big.

The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is one more 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer. Let's count the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...):\n\n1. 3*(1+3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nLooking at the original problem, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses. So, that suggests there are 9 layers in total. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...)) adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first 3 after the initial 3, each subsequent 3 adds a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each next is 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s in the expression. The initial 3 is outside, then each (1+3(...)) has a 3. So:\n\n- 3(1+3(...))\n- Then inside, 3(1+3(...))\n- So, each layer adds another 3.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3s. So, the innermost is 3, then each layer adds another 3. So, that would make 9 layers in total? Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nThen, moving out another layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))) So, the outermost layer is the 9th layer. So, the total value would be 36084.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without manually calculating each step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me denote the value after k layers as a_k. Then, the recurrence relation would be:\n\na_k = 3*(1 + a_{k-1})\n\nwith the base case a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for each layer, a_k = 3 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_k^{(h)} = C*3^k\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_k^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3\n\n-2A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_k = C*3^k - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdd 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nSo, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_k = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_k = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2\n\nWe can factor 3^k as (3^k), so:\n\na_k = (11*3^{k})/6 - 3/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, k=9.\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*3^9)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*19683)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nThus,\n\na_9 = 216513 / 6 - 3/2\n\nSimplify 216513 / 6:\n\nDivide 216513 by 6:\n\n6*36085 = 216510\n\nSo, 216513 - 216510 = 3\n\nSo, 216513 / 6 = 36085 + 3/6 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nWhich matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3. By applying this method step by step, we find that the value of the expression is 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's see. This looks like a series of nested additions and multiplications. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That's usually how these kinds of problems are solved.\n\nSo, let me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the inside, each time there's a 1+3, and then that result is multiplied by 3, and added to another 1, and so on. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: 1+3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another 1+3. Wait, but that's part of the same expression? Hmm, no, actually, each level is a separate 1+3. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each level is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous parentheses. Let me look again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, no, actually, let's see: each time we have 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is at Level 9: 1 + 3.\n\nThen Level 8 is 1 + 3*(Level 9 result).\n\nThen Level 7 is 1 + 3*(Level 8 result), and so on, until Level 1, which is multiplied by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them from the innermost as Level 1 to Level 9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's just start from the innermost and work our way out.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one level, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*(13). Compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost level is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 is 60000.\n\n3*9000 is 27000.\n\n3*500 is 1500.\n\n3*24 is 72.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps.\n\nLet me go through each level again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me see: each level n is 1 + 3*(level n+1). So, starting from level 9, which is 4, then level 8 is 13, level 7 is 40, level 6 is 121, level 5 is 364, level 4 is 1093, level 3 is 3280, level 2 is 9841, level 1 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me think: Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, starting from a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, that might not be the standard way, but perhaps we can express it as a recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series, but let me see.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(next expression). So, if we denote E as the entire expression inside the outermost 3, then E = 1 + 3*(next E). But since it's nested multiple times, perhaps we can model this as E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's more straightforward to compute each level as we did before, since there are only nine levels, so it's manageable.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the calculations. Let me verify each step again.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here where each level is 1 + 3*previous, so we can model this as a geometric progression.\n\nWait, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nBut starting from a_9 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc.\n\nThis looks like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nWait, but actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, which is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a linear recurrence.\n\nBut maybe it's more straightforward to compute each level as we did before.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, for example, the innermost level is 4, then each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series with a ratio of 3, but let me check.\n\nWait, let's think about the expression without the outermost 3. Let's denote E as the entire inner expression, so E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) eight more times.\n\nWait, but in our problem, it's 3*(E), where E is the expression with nine levels of 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a formula for E.\n\nLet me consider that E = 1 + 3*E', where E' is the expression with one fewer level.\n\nBut in our case, since there are nine levels, E_9 = 4, E_8 = 1 + 3*E_9, E_7 = 1 + 3*E_8, and so on, up to E_1, which is the entire inner expression, then the total is 3*E_1.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a general formula for E_n.\n\nWait, perhaps each E_n can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nFor example, E_1 would be (3^9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 - 1)/2 is 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, E_1 was 29524, which is 3*9841 + 1? Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nWait, if E_n is defined as the expression with n levels, then perhaps E_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: E_1 = 1 + 3*E_0, where E_0 = 1.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nBut (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. So that formula doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but starting from n=0.\n\nWait, E_0 = 1, E_1 = 4, E_2 = 13, E_3 = 40, etc.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nE_0 = 1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. Okay.\n\nE_1 = 4. (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. That works.\n\nE_2 = 13. (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. That works.\n\nE_3 = 40. (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. That works.\n\nE_4 = 121. (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121. That works.\n\nE_5 = 364. (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364. That works.\n\nE_6 = 1093. (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093. That works.\n\nE_7 = 3280. (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280. That works.\n\nE_8 = 9841. (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841. That works.\n\nE_9 = 29524. Wait, but according to this formula, E_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that matches our calculation.\n\nSo, in general, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each level, starting from n=0, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for our problem, the innermost level is E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm this with the step-by-step calculation we did earlier.\n\nYes, each E_n was matching the formula, so that's a good check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous, starting from 1.\n\nWait, but the expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but each term is added as 1, then 3, then 9, etc.\n\nWait, but in our case, each step is 1 + 3*previous, so the total sum would be a finite geometric series.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to use the formula we found.\n\nIn any case, both the step-by-step calculation and the formula give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down step by step:\n\n1. Innermost level: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers. It looks like each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, but it's nested multiple times. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nI think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer one at a time without getting confused. So, let's start from the inside.\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So the next layer is 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nAlright, so now that layer simplifies to 12. The next layer out is another (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting 12 in, we have:\n\n1 + 3*12\n\nLet me compute 3*12 first.\n\n3 * 12 = 36\n\nNow, add 1 to that:\n\n1 + 36 = 37\n\nSo, that layer simplifies to 37. Moving another layer out, we have 3 times 37.\n\n3 * 37 = 111\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication. 3*30 is 90, and 3*7 is 21, so 90 + 21 is 111. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(111)). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*111. Hmm, 3*100 is 300, 3*10 is 30, and 3*1 is 3. So, 300 + 30 + 3 = 333.\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 333 = 334.\n\nSo, that layer is 334. Next layer out is 3*334.\n\nLet me compute 3*300 first, which is 900, then 3*34 is 102. So, 900 + 102 = 1002.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. 3*334 is actually 1002? Wait, 334*3: 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 90 + 12 = 1002. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*1002). Let me compute 3*1002 first.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, and 3*2 is 6, so 3000 + 6 = 3006.\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 3006 = 3007.\n\nSo, that layer simplifies to 3007. Next, we have 3*3007.\n\nHmm, 3*3000 is 9000, and 3*7 is 21, so 9000 + 21 = 9021.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again. 3007*3: 3000*3=9000, 7*3=21, so yes, 9021.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*9021). Let me compute 3*9021 first.\n\n3*9000 is 27,000, and 3*21 is 63, so 27,000 + 63 = 27,063.\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 27,063 = 27,064.\n\nSo, that layer is 27,064. Next, we have 3*27,064.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*20,000 is 60,000, 3*7,000 is 21,000, 3*64 is 192. So, adding those together: 60,000 + 21,000 = 81,000, plus 192 is 81,192.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me do it step by step.\n\n27,064 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n\n64 * 3 = 192\n\nNow, add them all together: 60,000 + 21,000 = 81,000; 81,000 + 192 = 81,192.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*81,192). Let me compute 3*81,192.\n\n3*80,000 = 240,000\n\n3*1,000 = 3,000\n\n3*192 = 576\n\nSo, adding those together: 240,000 + 3,000 = 243,000; 243,000 + 576 = 243,576.\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 243,576 = 243,577.\n\nSo, that layer is 243,577. Next, we have 3*243,577.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*200,000 = 600,000\n\n3*40,000 = 120,000\n\n3*3,000 = 9,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*77 = 231\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n600,000 + 120,000 = 720,000\n\n720,000 + 9,000 = 729,000\n\n729,000 + 1,500 = 730,500\n\n730,500 + 231 = 730,731\n\nSo, 3*243,577 is 730,731.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*730,731). Let me compute 3*730,731 first.\n\n3*700,000 = 2,100,000\n\n3*30,000 = 90,000\n\n3*700 = 2,100\n\n3*31 = 93\n\nAdding them together: 2,100,000 + 90,000 = 2,190,000; 2,190,000 + 2,100 = 2,192,100; 2,192,100 + 93 = 2,192,193.\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 2,192,193 = 2,192,194.\n\nSo, that layer simplifies to 2,192,194. Next, we have 3*2,192,194.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*2,000,000 = 6,000,000\n\n3*192,000 = 576,000\n\n3*194 = 582\n\nAdding them together: 6,000,000 + 576,000 = 6,576,000; 6,576,000 + 582 = 6,576,582.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 2,192,194 is a big number.\n\nAlternatively, let me break it down:\n\n2,192,194 * 3:\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n\n192,000 * 3 = 576,000\n\n194 * 3 = 582\n\nSo, 6,000,000 + 576,000 = 6,576,000\n\n6,576,000 + 582 = 6,576,582\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*6,576,582). Let me compute 3*6,576,582 first.\n\n3*6,000,000 = 18,000,000\n\n3*500,000 = 1,500,000\n\n3*70,000 = 210,000\n\n3*6,000 = 18,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*82 = 246\n\nAdding them together:\n\n18,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 19,500,000\n\n19,500,000 + 210,000 = 19,710,000\n\n19,710,000 + 18,000 = 19,728,000\n\n19,728,000 + 1,500 = 19,729,500\n\n19,729,500 + 246 = 19,729,746\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 19,729,746 = 19,729,747.\n\nSo, that layer is 19,729,747. Next, we have 3*19,729,747.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*10,000,000 = 30,000,000\n\n3*9,000,000 = 27,000,000\n\n3*700,000 = 2,100,000\n\n3*29,000 = 87,000\n\n3*700 = 2,100\n\n3*47 = 141\n\nWait, maybe breaking it down differently:\n\n19,729,747 * 3:\n\n10,000,000 * 3 = 30,000,000\n\n9,000,000 * 3 = 27,000,000\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n29,000 * 3 = 87,000\n\n700 * 3 = 2,100\n\n47 * 3 = 141\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n30,000,000 + 27,000,000 = 57,000,000\n\n57,000,000 + 2,100,000 = 59,100,000\n\n59,100,000 + 87,000 = 59,187,000\n\n59,187,000 + 2,100 = 59,189,100\n\n59,189,100 + 141 = 59,189,241\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute 19,729,747 * 3 step by step:\n\n19,729,747 * 3:\n\n7 * 3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\n\n1 * 3 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, writing it all together from the last step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n7*3=21 \u2192 1, carry 2\n\n4*3=12 +2=14 \u21924, carry1\n\n7*3=21 +1=22 \u21922, carry2\n\n4*3=12 +2=14 \u21924, carry1\n\n7*3=21 +1=22 \u21922, carry2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29 \u21929, carry2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23 \u21923, carry2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry0\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carry2\n\n1*3=3 +2=5 \u21925\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, the result is 59,189,241.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my previous sum. Hmm, let me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn the step-by-step multiplication:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n7 * 3 = 21 \u2192 write 1, carryover 2\n\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14 \u2192 write 4, carryover 1\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 write 2, carryover 2\n\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14 \u2192 write 4, carryover 1\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 write 2, carryover 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write 9, carryover 2\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 write 3, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n\n1 * 3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \u2192 write 5\n\nSo, writing the digits from last to first: 5, 7, 8, 3, 9, 2, 4, 1.\n\nWait, that seems like 59,189,241.\n\nBut when I did the other way, adding up the parts, I got 59,189,241 as well. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*19,729,747 is 59,189,241.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*59,189,241). Let me compute 3*59,189,241 first.\n\n3*50,000,000 = 150,000,000\n\n3*9,000,000 = 27,000,000\n\n3*189,000 = 567,000\n\n3*241 = 723\n\nAdding them together:\n\n150,000,000 + 27,000,000 = 177,000,000\n\n177,000,000 + 567,000 = 177,567,000\n\n177,567,000 + 723 = 177,567,723\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 177,567,723 = 177,567,724.\n\nSo, that layer is 177,567,724. Next, we have 3*177,567,724.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*100,000,000 = 300,000,000\n\n3*70,000,000 = 210,000,000\n\n3*7,000,000 = 21,000,000\n\n3*500,000 = 1,500,000\n\n3*67,000 = 201,000\n\n3*700 = 2,100\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nWait, maybe breaking it down differently:\n\n177,567,724 * 3:\n\n100,000,000 * 3 = 300,000,000\n\n70,000,000 * 3 = 210,000,000\n\n7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n\n500,000 * 3 = 1,500,000\n\n67,000 * 3 = 201,000\n\n700 * 3 = 2,100\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n300,000,000 + 210,000,000 = 510,000,000\n\n510,000,000 + 21,000,000 = 531,000,000\n\n531,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 532,500,000\n\n532,500,000 + 201,000 = 532,701,000\n\n532,701,000 + 2,100 = 532,703,100\n\n532,703,100 + 72 = 532,703,172\n\nWait, that seems correct.

Let me write it down properly:\n\n177,567,724 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n7 * 3 = 21 \u2192 write 1, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\n7 * 3 = 21 \u2192 write 1, carryover 2\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 write 3, carryover 2\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20 \u2192 write 0, carryover 2\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 write 2, carryover 2\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 write 3, carryover 2\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n\n1 * 3 = 3 + 1 = 4 \u2192 write 4, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 4, 7, 3, 2, 0, 8, 1, 7, 3, 2, 4.\n\nWait, that seems like 532,703,172. Wait, let me read it properly.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n4 \u21922\n\n2 \u21927\n\n7 \u21921\n\n2 \u21928\n\n7 \u21921\n\n7 \u21923\n\n6 \u21920\n\n5 \u21927\n\n7 \u21922\n\n7 \u21923\n\n5 \u21927\n\n1 \u21924\n\nSo, writing the digits in order: 4, 7, 3, 2, 0, 8, 1, 7, 3, 2, 4.\n\nWait, that would be 473,208,172? No, that can't be right because the number is 177,567,724.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the order. Let me list them in reverse order:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nFirst digit: 4*3=12 \u21922, carryover1\n\nSecond digit:2*3=6 +1=7\n\nThird digit:7*3=21 \u21921, carryover2\n\nFourth digit:2*3=6 +2=8\n\nFifth digit:7*3=21 \u21921, carryover2\n\nSixth digit:7*3=21 +2=23 \u21923, carryover2\n\nSeventh digit:6*3=18 +2=20 \u21920, carryover2\n\nEighth digit:5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1\n\nNinth digit:7*3=21 +1=22 \u21922, carryover2\n\nTenth digit:7*3=21 +2=23 \u21923, carryover2\n\nEleventh digit:5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1\n\nTwelfth digit:1*3=3 +1=4\n\nWait, so the digits from right to left are:\n\n2 (from 4*3), 7 (from 2*3), 1 (from 7*3), 8 (from 2*3), 1 (from 7*3), 3 (from 7*3), 0 (from 6*3), 7 (from 5*3), 2 (from 7*3), 3 (from 7*3), 7 (from 5*3), 4 (from 1*3)\n\nSo, writing them in order from left to right, the number is 4 (from the last multiplication) followed by 7, 3, 2, 0, 8, 1, 7, 3, 2, 4.\n\nWait, that would be 473,208,172, but that doesn't match 532,703,172.\n\nHmm, I must be making a mistake here. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial calculation using the broken-down parts was correct: 300,000,000 + 210,000,000 = 510,000,000; 510,000,000 + 21,000,000 = 531,000,000; 531,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 532,500,000; 532,500,000 + 201,000 = 532,701,000; 532,701,000 + 2,100 = 532,703,100; 532,703,100 + 72 = 532,703,172.\n\nBut when I do the step-by-step multiplication, I get 532,703,172 as well. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step, I was getting confused with the digit order. Let me confirm once more.\n\n177,567,724 * 3:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n     177,567,724\n   x          3\n   -------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n\n7 * 3 = 21 \u2192 write down 1, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 0\n\n7 * 3 = 21 \u2192 write down 1, carryover 2\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 write down 3, carryover 2\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20 \u2192 write down 0, carryover 2\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 1\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 2\n\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 write down 3, carryover 2\n\n1 * 3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \u2192 write down 5\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left as we computed:\n\n2, 7, 1, 8, 1, 3, 0, 7, 2, 3, 5\n\nBut wait, that's 11 digits. The original number is 177,567,724 which is 9 digits. So, when multiplied by 3, it's 9 digits, so the result should be 9 or 10 digits. Wait, 177,567,724 is approximately 177 million, so 3 times that is approximately 531 million, which is 9 digits.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of digits.\n\nWait, 177,567,724 is 9 digits. Multiplying by 3, the result can be up to 10 digits, but in this case, it's 532,703,172, which is 9 digits. Wait, 532,703,172 is 9 digits.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I got 5 (from the first digit) and then 2,3, etc., which seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused because I'm writing the digits from right to left. Let me try to write them in the correct order.\n\nSo, after multiplying each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0\n\n7*3=21 \u2192 write1, carryover2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8, carryover0\n\n7*3=21 \u2192 write1, carryover2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23 \u2192 write3, carryover2\n\n6*3=18 +2=20 \u2192 write0, carryover2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17 \u2192 write7, carryover1\n\n7*3=21 +1=22 \u2192 write2, carryover2\n\n1*3=3 +2=5 \u2192 write5\n\nSo, writing the digits in the order they were computed (right to left):\n\n2,7,1,8,1,3,0,7,2,5\n\nWait, that's 10 digits. So, the result is 532,703,172, which is 9 digits, but I have 10 digits here. That suggests I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 177,567,724 is 9 digits: 1,7,7,5,6,7,7,2,4.\n\nMultiplying by 3, the result should be:\n\n1*3=3, 7*3=21, 7*3=21, 5*3=15, 6*3=18, 7*3=21, 7*3=21, 2*3=6, 4*3=12.\n\nBut when I add the carryovers, it's possible that the first digit becomes two digits, making it 10 digits.\n\nWait, let me do it properly:\n\n177,567,724\n*          3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carryover0\n\n7*3=21 \u2192 write1, carryover2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8, carryover0\n\n7*3=21 \u2192 write1, carryover2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23 \u2192 write3, carryover2\n\n6*3=18 +2=20 \u2192 write0, carryover2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17 \u2192 write7, carryover1\n\n7*3=21 +1=22 \u2192 write2, carryover2\n\n1*3=3 +2=5 \u2192 write5\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are: 2,7,1,8,1,3,0,7,2,5.\n\nBut that's 10 digits. So, the number is 532,703,172.\n\nWait, 532,703,172 is 9 digits, but according to this, it's 10 digits. I must have messed up the placement.\n\nWait, no, 532,703,172 is 9 digits: 5 (hundred millions), 3 (ten millions), 2 (millions), 7 (hundred thousands), 0 (ten thousands), 3 (thousands), 1 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 532,703,172 is 9 digits.\n\nBut according to the multiplication, I have 10 digits: 5,3,2,7,0,3,1,7,2,4. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, no, the digits from the multiplication are:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover0\n\n7*3=21 \u21921, carryover2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover0\n\n7*3=21 \u21921, carryover2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23 \u21923, carryover2\n\n6*3=18 +2=20 \u21920, carryover2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1\n\n7*3=21 +1=22 \u21922, carryover2\n\n1*3=3 +2=5 \u21925\n\nSo, writing them from left to right as we go:\n\nFirst digit (units place): 2\n\nTens place:7\n\nHundreds place:1\n\nThousands place:8\n\nTen thousands place:1\n\nHundred thousands place:3\n\nMillions place:0\n\nTen millions place:7\n\nHundred millions place:2\n\nBillions place:5\n\nWait, that can't be right because 177,567,724 is less than 200,000,000, so 3"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, so I need to take it step by step. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me try to parse this. It looks like there are multiple layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3 each time. So, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. I think that's the right approach because of the order of operations\u2014parentheses come first.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Maybe I'll start from the innermost part and compute each layer one by one. Let's see, the innermost part is 1+3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 3 multiplied by that result, plus 1, right? Wait, no, actually, looking closer, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Hmm, maybe I should write each step separately.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That equals 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, hold on, no. Let me check. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me look again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))).\n\nSo each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each step is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write each step clearly.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost. So, layer 1 is 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer 1). Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and compute each step, moving outward. So let me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, S1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*S1.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define each step as S_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as S1.\n\nSo, S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, S2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the order. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let's write down each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, but that seems different. Wait, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step).\n\nWait, let me test this.\n\nLet me try with a smaller version to see if I'm on the right track.\n\nSuppose the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nSo, the result is 39.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, in this case, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, for the original problem, which has nine layers, I need to compute each step from the innermost outwards.\n\nSo, let's go back to the original problem, which has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, let me list each step:\n\nLet me define S1 as the innermost, S2 as the next, up to S9 as the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's S1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this S2.\n\nThen, next layer out: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Let's call this S3.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. S4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. S5.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. S6.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. S7.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. S8.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. S9.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing S9, which is 29524, the outermost operation is 3*S9.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting with S1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by S9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each step manually.\n\nWait, each step seems to follow a pattern where each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for S_n.\n\nThe recurrence is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be expressed as S_n = a*r^n + b, where r is the common ratio.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution S_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, S_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nS_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: S1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: S3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: S4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: S5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: S6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: S7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: S8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: S9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, S9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*S9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost operation is 3*S9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves calculating 1 plus three times the result of the next innermost expression. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows a pattern, allowing us to compute the final result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)).

    "text": " It's a bit of a long expression, but I think I can handle it step by step. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Okay, so it's a series of additions and multiplications. Since there are so many layers, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's one layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps around that. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost:\n\n- The very first innermost is (1 + 3) which is layer 1.\n- Then, moving outwards, each \"1 + 3(...)\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, it's 3 multiplied by a sum, which itself contains another 3 multiplied by a sum, and so on. So, each layer is a \"1 + 3(...)\", and each of those is multiplied by 3 in the outer layer.\n\nSo, the structure is like this:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * ... * (1 + 3) ) ) )\n\nI think there are 9 layers here. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n3. So, each layer is built by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then multiplying by 3 again in the next layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a recursive structure. Each layer is defined by the previous one. So, perhaps I can denote each layer as a term and compute them one by one.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say L1 is the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3).\n\nThen, L2 is (1 + 3*L1)\n\nL3 is (1 + 3*L2)\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, which would be the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, L2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL3 = 40.\n\nNow, L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL4 = 121.\n\nNext, L5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL5 = 364.\n\nNow, L6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL6 = 1093.\n\nMoving on to L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL7 = 3280.\n\nNext, L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nL9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9. So, the final result is:\n\n3 * L9 = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 29,524.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 3 * 29,524 directly.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n__________\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\nUnits place: 4 * 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000.\n\nSubtract 476 * 3 because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524.\n\n476 * 3 = 1,428.\n\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, L9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or see if there's a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9, so L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. We define each layer \\( L_n \\) as follows:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_2 \\)\n- ...\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_8 \\)\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot L_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. It looks like each layer is a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's a repeated pattern. Maybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out.\n\nLet me write this out more clearly. The expression is a series of 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Each \"something\" is another 3 multiplied by (1 + another something), and this goes on until the innermost part, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, let's compute the next layer.\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\n3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So that's 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of 3*(1+... terms.\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 8 more 3*(1+...) terms. So, starting from L1 to L9?\n\nWait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then 1+3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. Continuing until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3(...).\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each step out is another layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times we have 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, we have 1+3*(layer1), which is layer2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(layer2) is layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3*(1+... terms:\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are 8 more 3*(1+...) terms, because each opening parenthesis after the first one corresponds to a new layer. Let me check:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3*(...))\n- Inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- And so on, until we reach 1+3, which is the innermost.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost 1+3 as layer1.\n\nThen each step out is a new layer, so let's count the number of layers.\n\nWait, the expression has 9 sets of (1+3*(...)), because starting from the innermost, each time you have a (1+3*(...)), and you have to go out 8 more layers beyond the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think that the innermost is layer1, then each step out is layer2, layer3, etc., up to layer9.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by 8 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer1, then each time we go out, it's another layer, so 8 layers in total beyond the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 9 layers because each (1+3(...) is a layer, including the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer9, which is the result of the innermost expression, we have to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the first (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, after computing Layer9, which is the innermost (1 + 3), and working outwards, the result of the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, but that might be the result of the innermost expression. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem step by step, writing each layer:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524.\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, because the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is Layer1, and the outermost is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer9.\n\nSo, the total result is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n-------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3(...)).\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another layer.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we can go inwards, which is 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, that was 29524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get the final result as 88,572.\n\nBut let me check: If the innermost is Layer1, then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, the expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, not 9, because the expression starts with 3*(1+3*(...)), and the innermost is 1+3, which would be Layer1. Then, each layer after that is another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by 8 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, including the innermost, that's 8 layers beyond the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I think I included the initial 3 as Layer1, but that might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3 is outside the first layer. Let me think.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and so on, until Layer9 is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because Layer9 would be the innermost. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, with Layer9 being the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me define each layer starting from the innermost as Layer1, then each step out is Layer2, Layer3, etc.\n\nSo, Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which evaluates to Layer9.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check: How many layers are there? Each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so starting from Layer1 as the innermost, we have 9 layers, with Layer9 being the result of the innermost expression.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which has 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of times we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nThe expression starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ...) terms.\n\nSo, that would mean 8 layers beyond the initial 3. So, perhaps the total number of layers is 8, and the final result is 3*(Layer8).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nIf the expression is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and so on, with Layer8 being the innermost.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The innermost is 1 + 3, which would be Layer1, then each step out is another layer. So, with 8 layers beyond the initial 3, that would mean Layer1 is 1 + 3, Layer2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, up to Layer9, which is the result of the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of layers being 9, with the initial 3 being outside, so the total expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should compute the layers step by step, keeping track of each one, and see where I end up.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside, which evaluates to Layer9.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me see how many times I applied the 1 + 3*Layer operation.\n\nI applied it 9 times, from Layer1 to Layer9, each time taking 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nBut the original expression has 8 layers beyond the initial 3, so maybe Layer9 is incorrect, and I should stop at Layer8.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer.\n\nThus, the innermost expression is 1+3, which is Layer1, then each step out adds another layer, so total layers beyond the initial 3 are 8, meaning Layer1 to Layer8.\n\nWait, so that would mean that the result inside the initial 3's parentheses is Layer8, which is 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer8 = 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but 9841 is four digits, so let's compute:\n\n9841\nx   3\n------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 becomes 2000.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 9841 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it properly:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 as 2000.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 9841 * 3 is actually 29,523.\n\nBecause 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, so if Layer8 is 9841, then the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, I think I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct number of layers is 8, leading to Layer8 = 9841, and the total expression is 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses: each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer1, and each step out adds another layer.\n\nSo, Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, yes, Layer8 is 9841, which is the result inside the initial 3's parentheses.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to Layer9, I had 29524, which seems to be one layer too many.\n\nWait, perhaps I included an extra layer. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of times I have (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to how many?\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have another (1+3(...)), and the number of such layers is 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses.\n\nTherefore, Layer1 is 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4 is 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5 is 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6 is 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7 is 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8 is 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, yes, Layer8 is 9841, and the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to Layer9, I had 29524, which was one layer too many because the original expression only has 8 layers beyond the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to Layer8, giving 9841, then multiplying by 3 to get 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me compute each layer step by step, making sure I don't go beyond the required layers.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer8 is 9841, and then the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier when I computed up to Layer9, I thought I had 9 layers, but perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3 is not part of the layer count, so the number of layers is 8, leading to 9841, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by another method.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the sequence is defined as:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, a_8 = 9841, which is the result inside the initial 3's parentheses. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nThe general formula for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=8, a_8 = (3^{9} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the result inside the initial 3's parentheses is 9841, and the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_8 \\) starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n3. The result of the innermost expression is \\( L_8 = 9841 \\).\n\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final value:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 9841 = 29523\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{29523}\\)."

The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's quite a chain of operations. Let me try to break it down. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting lost in the complexity.\n\nOkay, so let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then being multiplied by 3. So, it's like a series of nested 1 + 3(...) expressions, each time multiplied by 3 on the outside.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), then\n2. Next layer is 1 + 3*(result of above),\n3. Then another layer, and so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but let me check: each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. So, it's like a recursive expression, each time building on the previous result.\n\nLet me try to represent this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, S1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, S2 = 1 + 3*S1\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2\n\nAnd so on, up to S9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(the previous S). So, each S is defined as 1 + 3*(previous S).\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is S1, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, in the original problem, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the 1, there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer. Then each step out adds another layer.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.

And so on, until step 9.\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 9 layers here, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, S1 to S9.\n\nWait, let me check again. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is the number of times this happens.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out is 1 + 3*(previous), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first \"1 + 3(\" is at the innermost, then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" is one layer out.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(innermost), then another 1 + 3*(previous), etc.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n4. 1 + 3*(3)\n5. 1 + 3*(4)\n6. 1 + 3*(5)\n7. 1 + 3*(6)\n8. 1 + 3*(7)\n9. 1 + 3*(8)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total, from S1 to S9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(S9), where S9 is 1 + 3*S8.\n\nSo, to compute the entire expression, I need to compute S1 through S9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.

Let me just verify with a different approach to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each step is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for S_n.\n\nGiven S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is S_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume S_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nS_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition S_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nS_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's check this formula with n=1:\n\nS_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nS_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nS_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, S_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, after computing each step carefully and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires computing from the innermost parentheses outward. By breaking it down step by step and using a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let S\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent term is defined as S\u2099 = 1 + 3*S\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\n3. **Compute Each Step**:\n   - S\u2081 = 4\n   - S\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - S\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - S\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - S\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - S\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - S\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - S\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - S\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply S\u2089 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
