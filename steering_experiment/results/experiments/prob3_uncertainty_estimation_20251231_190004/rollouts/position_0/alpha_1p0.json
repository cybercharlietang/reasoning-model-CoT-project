    "text": " It's a bit of a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right: \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like each layer is a 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses seem to be (1 + 3). So, let me start there.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n\nStarting from the very inside:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) \n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost part is at the end, right? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3) at the very end. So, starting from there:\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) \n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, let me think of it as layers. Maybe I should number them from the inside out.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, starting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out to L2, which is 1 + 3*(L1). So,\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit fast. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write each step more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this A.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: (1 + 3*A) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this B.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*B) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Let's call this C.\n\nContinuing: (1 + 3*C) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Let's call this D.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*D) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Let's call this E.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*E) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Let's call this F.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*F) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Let's call this G.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*G) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Let's call this H.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*H) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Let's call this I.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times that outermost layer, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing I, which is 29524, we need to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous), and finally, the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I called the outermost layer I as 29524, which is (1 + 3*H). But actually, the outermost expression is 3*(I). So, I think I made a mistake in my earlier calculation because I included the 3 multiplication as part of each layer.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the entire thing is multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost, and then finally multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*...). So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524).\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n500*3 = 1500. 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n20*3 = 60. 88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n4*3 = 12. 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my earlier steps again because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each 3*(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is one layer. Let's see:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a function f(n) where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, but in this case, the number of layers is fixed at 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nWait, in general, an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be expressed in terms of a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define x_k as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, x_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nx_2 = 1 + 3*x_1.\n\nx_3 = 1 + 3*x_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to x_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9.\n\nSo, we can compute x_1 through x_9 step by step.\n\nLet me compute them:\n\nx_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nx_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nx_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nx_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nx_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nx_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nx_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nx_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nx_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier layers, let me recompute a few steps.\n\nCompute x_1 to x_9 again:\n\nx_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nx_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nx_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nx_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nx_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nx_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nx_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nx_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nx_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the original problem was correctly interpreted.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(...), and there are 9 such layers, starting from (1 + 3) and going outwards.\n\nSo, yes, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = C*3^{n-1} + d,\n\nwhere d is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find d, set a_{n+1} = a_n = d.\n\nSo, d = 1 + 3*d.\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd = 1 + 3d\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2d\n\n=> d = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1,\n\na_1 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561.\n\nSo, 3^8=6561.\n\nThus,\n\na_9 = (9*6561 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 9*6561:\n\n9*6000=54000\n\n9*500=4500\n\n9*61=549\n\nWait, 9*6561:\n\nLet me compute 6561*9:\n\n6000*9=54000\n\n500*9=4500\n\n60*9=540\n\n1*9=9\n\nSo, 54000 + 4500 = 58500.\n\n58500 + 540 = 59040.\n\n59040 + 9 = 59049.\n\nSo, 9*6561=59049.\n\nThus,\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, using a recurrence relation, and finding a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 one more time.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous result. After computing all layers, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, so I have to be careful with the order of operations. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers. It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(...)\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Inside that, there's another 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and this repeats multiple times. Let me try to figure out how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) and it seems like there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, let me count the number of 3s inside each layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just start simplifying from the inside out, step by step, and see where that takes me. That might be clearer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, no. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The innermost part is the last (1 + 3). So actually, the very last parentheses is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then moving one layer out, that 4 is inside another (1 + 3(...)), so the next layer is 1 + 3*(4).\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps I should approach it step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to write this down step by step, simplifying each layer as I go outwards.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nThen, L3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer, and there are nine such layers, right? Because after the first 3, there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, there's another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the last one is (1 + 3). So how many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost is the last one, which is (1 + 3). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the first 3, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, so each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another layer, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is the ninth layer. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Because each time, I'm adding a new layer, but perhaps I miscounted how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time, moving outward, we have another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because after the first 3, there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to layer 9, I got 29524, and then the outermost layer is 3*(29524). Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each layer correctly, because that seems like a big number, but maybe that's correct.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524). Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 total so far: 87,000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 total: 88,500\n\nThen, 24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 total: 88,572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I counted the layers correctly. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers there are.\n\nIn the original expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, right? Let me check:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nYes, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. So, starting from that, each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1.\n\nSo, with 9 layers, we end up with 29524 before multiplying by the outermost 3, giving 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but given that it's only 9 layers, step-by-step computation might be the most straightforward way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*next_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, the layers form a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, L_1 was 4, L_2 was 13, L_3 was 40, etc. So, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with my earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is L_1, and the outermost layer is L_9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me test n=5.\n\nFrom earlier, L_5 was 364.\n\nUsing the formula: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems solid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\" and each of those is a layer. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears after the initial 3. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the pattern is \"1 + 3(...)\", and the number of such patterns is 9, because the innermost is the 9th one.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sequences, I think it's 9. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first layer is (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the last one, which is (1 + 3). So, that's 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, and just computed each layer step by step, I would get the same result, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe simplify each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter simplifying all layers, we have the outermost layer:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It says:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and threes. It looks like a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that involve 1s and 3s. Hmm, maybe I can simplify it step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually seems to work with these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me count the number of 1 + 3 terms to make sure I'm replacing the correct innermost one. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3 times the next parentheses. So, the innermost is the last (1 + 3), which is the ninth one, right? So, yeah, replacing that with 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. So, inside this, it's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. So, the innermost was (1 + 3) = 4, then the next one is (1 + 3*4) = 13. So, yeah, that part becomes 13. So, moving out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\n3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, after the first two steps, we had (1 + 3) = 4, then (1 + 3*4) = 13, then the next one is (1 + 3*13) = 40. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nContinuing outward, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))))\n\nWait, hold on, let me count. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nSo, yes, the next one is (1 + 3*121). Let me compute that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. So, after 121, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*121) = 364. So, replacing that, the next level is (1 + 3*364). Let me compute that.\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))))\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, so after (1 + 3*121) = 364, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*364). Let me compute that again.\n\n3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, moving out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute that.\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(3280))\n\nWait, let me check. So, after (1 + 3*1093) = 3280, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute that.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3*9841)\n\nWait, but actually, let me see. So, the next parentheses after 3280 is (1 + 3*3280) = 9841. So, then moving out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute that.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3*29524)\n\nWait, so now, the next step is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(88573)\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me see. So, after (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute that.\n\n3*88573: Let's compute 88573*3. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, but hold on. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which we just computed as 3*(265720). So, 3*265720.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip a step. So, the expression was:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWe started from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then each step moving out, we computed each parentheses as follows:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n\n11. (1 + 3*88573) = 265720\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of 1 + 3 terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is the ninth one, so when we compute up to the ninth one, we get to 265720. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that.\n\nSo, 3 * 265720.\n\nLet me compute that. 265720 * 3.\n\nCompute 200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000\n\n5000*3=15000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n20*3=60\n\n0*3=0\n\nWait, no, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20 + 0.\n\nWait, actually, 265720 is 2*100000 + 6*10000 + 5*1000 + 7*100 + 2*10 + 0*1.\n\nSo, 2*100000=200000\n\n6*10000=60000\n\n5*1000=5000\n\n7*100=700\n\n2*10=20\n\n0*1=0\n\nAdding them up: 200000 + 60000 = 260000, 260000 + 5000 = 265000, 265000 + 700 = 265700, 265700 + 20 = 265720.\n\nSo, 265720 * 3: Let's compute 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 + 15000 = 795000\n\n795000 + 2100 = 797100\n\n797100 + 60 = 797160\n\nSo, 265720 * 3 = 797160.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check 265720 * 3 again.\n\n265720 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3=0\n\n2*3=6\n\n7*3=21, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n\n6*3=18 + 1 = 19, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n0\n\n6\n\n1 (from 21, but we carryover 2, so next digit is 1 + 2=3? Wait, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nWait, actually, let's compute 265720 * 3:\n\n3 * 0 = 0\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n3 * 6 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, writing it together: 797160.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the steps again because this seems like a lot, and I might have missed a step earlier.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n\n11. (1 + 3*88573) = 265720\n\n12. Finally, 3 * 265720 = 797160\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to make this easier, maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) nine times. So, it's like a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\na_11 = 1 + 3*a_10 = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_11 = 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can find A.\n\nWait, hold on, in our case, a_1 = 4, but according to the definition, n starts at 1, so let's see.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, the innermost term is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nSo, using n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, let's check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, that seems to work.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, we have 11 layers of a_n, starting from n=1 to n=11.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let's see: the innermost is a_1 =4, then a_2=13, up to a_11=265720.\n\nWait, but according to our formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=11, a_11 = (3^{12} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{12}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147, 3^12=531441.\n\nSo, 3^{12}=531441.\n\nTherefore, a_11 = (531441 -1)/2 = 531440/2 = 265720. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_11 = 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 797160.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{12} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\n3^12=531441\n\nYes, correct. So, 531441 -1=531440, divided by 2 is 265720, times 3 is 797160.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication steps again.\n\nCompute 265720 * 3:\n\n265720\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3=0\n\n2*3=6\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15 + 2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, the result is 797160.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 265720 * 3 as (200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20) * 3 = 600000 + 180000 + 15000 + 2100 + 60 = 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 797,160.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{797160}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse it step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, that's a layer. Let me see... starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then that's multiplied by 3 in the next layer.\n2. Then, the result of that is inside another (1 + ...), which is multiplied by 3 again.\n3. This pattern continues until the outermost 3.\n\nI think I need to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3 * (result from Layer 1) = 3 * 4 = 12. But wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Hmm, maybe I should think of each step as computing the innermost expression first and then moving outward.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 3 multiplying a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\nHow many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3s before each parenthesis. Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each time it's 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12, but wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n\nSo, let me structure it as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since I think there are 9 layers. Wait, let me count the number of 3s. Each 3 is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we have another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 L1\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 L2\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s before each parenthesis. Each 3 corresponds to a layer.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12, but actually, it's 1 + 3*(Layer1). Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer1). Let me correct that.\n\nSo, Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of times I see a 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time I add another layer. Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent 3(1 + ...) adds a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s before the parentheses:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n- 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n\n- 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 layer 3\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by a parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each 3*(...) adds a layer. Let me count how many 3*(...) there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3) \u2192 layer 2\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 layer 3\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 layer 4\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s before the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers as the number of 3s before the parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n\nWait, no, that might not be the correct way. Let me think again.\n\nActually, each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, let's list them:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a layer. Let me count the number of times I have 1 + 3*(...). Each time I go outward, it's another layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1\n\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer1) \u2192 Layer2\n\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer2) \u2192 Layer3\n\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer3) \u2192 Layer4\n\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer4) \u2192 Layer5\n\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer5) \u2192 Layer6\n\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer6) \u2192 Layer7\n\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer7) \u2192 Layer8\n\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer8) \u2192 Layer9\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*.\n\nSo, Layer1 = 4\n\nLayer2 = 13\n\nLayer3 = 40\n\nLayer4 = 121\n\nLayer5 = 364\n\nLayer6 = 1093\n\nLayer7 = 3280\n\nLayer8 = 9841\n\nLayer9 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 7.\n\n52 * 3 = 156 +7 = 163 \u2192 write down 3, carryover 16.\n\n95 * 3 = 285 +16 = 301 \u2192 write down 1, carryover 30.\n\n29 * 3 = 87 +30 = 117 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 11.\n\nFinally, 0 * 3 = 0 +11 =11 \u2192 write down 11.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n---------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a(1 + a(1 + a(1 + ...))) can be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me try to find the particular solution. Assume L_n = C, a constant.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nBut since our initial condition is L1=4, which is positive, and the terms are increasing, maybe this approach isn't directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recognize that each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute each layer step by step as I did before, which seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute it using a formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = K*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = K*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4.\n\nAt n=1: L1 = K*3^1 -1/2 = 3K -1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3K =4 +1/2 =9/2 \u2192 K= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1.\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) \u00d73\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n\n=60,000 +27,000 +1,500 +60 +12\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n60,000 +27,000 =87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've got it right. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, applying the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) for each layer.

    "text": " It looks like a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the innermost expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so now I can replace the innermost part with 4. Let me rewrite the expression with that substitution. The next layer out would be 3 times that result. So, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n3(1 + 3( ... )) where the innermost ... is now 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, let me number the layers from the inside out.\n\nLet me try to parse this correctly. Let's count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result from 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from 2)\n4. 1 + 3*(result from 3)\n5. 1 + 3*(result from 4)\n6. 1 + 3*(result from 5)\n7. 1 + 3*(result from 6)\n8. 1 + 3*(result from 7)\n9. 1 + 3*(result from 8)\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(result from 9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis is part of a new layer. So, starting after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, that means there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it as a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it more carefully.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number:\n\n- The digits are: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 + 1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the multiplication again because that's where I might have made a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me check L9 again.\n\nL8 was 9841, so L9 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is 9 thousands, 8 hundreds, 4 tens, 1 unit.\n\nWait, 9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 before the 9? Wait, no, that would be incorrect.\n\nWait, actually, 9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 in front, making it 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841=29523. Then, L9=1 + 29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, so I think I did it right. But just to be thorough, let me check each step once more.\n\nL1: 1+3=4\n\nL2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nFinal step:3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each ( corresponds to a new layer. So, that would be 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers, so L1 to L9, each time computing 1 + 3*previous layer.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, I started with L1=1+3, then L2=1+3*L1, up to L9, then multiplied by 3. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the number of layers. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n\nThen, each time we have a new 1+3*(...). Let's see:\n\nAfter the innermost, we have 3(1+3(...)), then another 3(1+3(...)), etc. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3 in the expression, which is 9 times, right?\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9. So, that would mean 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L1 to L9, each time computing 1 + 3*L_prev.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, my calculations should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me try computing L9 again just to be sure.\n\nL8 was 9841. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step.\n\nWait, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*(a)^n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = a*K + b => K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nAt n=1, L_1=4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. So, L9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got this. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute and compute each subsequent layer:\n   - L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost 3 by L9: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Because each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So let me check my calculations again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That's correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total 3000+279=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 *3 = 27,000\n\n500 *3 = 1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, but 20,000 +9,000 is 29,000, plus 500 is 29,500, plus 20 is 29,520, plus 4 is 29,524.\n\nSo 20,000*3 = 60,000\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524\n*       3\n---------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the number is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n29,524 *3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n*  3\n-------\nFirst, 4*3=12, so write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again, just to be sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, all layers look correct. So 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer step by step.\n\nWait, let me think. The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) n times. So each time, it's a geometric series perhaps?\n\nWait, so let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} =1.\n\nWait, but actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found as the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} =0, which has solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A =1 +3A => 0 =1 +2A => A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, so let me check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, so I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3^{10} is 59049, right? Because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo the formula gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I should double-check my initial approach where I computed each layer step by step because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3(1+3))))))))))).\n\nWait, let me count the number of 1+3 expressions inside.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time you have 1+3, and each time it's inside another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is at the end, then each layer adds another 1+3 before that.\n\nWait, so perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. Because each time you have another 1+3, so 9 layers, meaning n=9.\n\nSo that would mean a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again by actually computing each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, and each step seems correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The formula I derived was a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, which is correct. So 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the expression without using the formula, but by expanding each layer step by step, to ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*(13)=1 + 39=40\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps by expanding it.\n\nWait, but expanding 9 layers manually would be time-consuming, so maybe I can think in terms of the formula I derived earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can also compute the value using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, since each layer is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, which we already solved, giving a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3 multiplied by a sum that's a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me consider S = 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but S itself is 1 +3*S', where S' is the next layer. But maybe this approach complicates things more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but given that each layer is 1 +3*previous, it's more efficient to use the recurrence formula.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Let me consider that each time we add a layer, we're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*previous +1.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the recurrence relation we had before.\n\nSo, I think using the formula is the most efficient way.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n*     3\n---------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 *3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost layer is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards? Yeah, that seems like a good approach because otherwise, it's too confusing with all those layers.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part. So, the innermost part is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing the innermost (1+3) with 4, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is the last (1+3), which is at the very end. So, when I replace that, the next layer up becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me make sure I'm replacing correctly.\n\nMaybe it's better to number each layer from the inside out. Let's see, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many 3s are there. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1. Wait, maybe I should count how many times 3 is multiplied.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that each time, starting from the innermost, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is a multiplication by 3 of (1 + something). So, let's count how many layers there are.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3( is the outermost, then each time another 3( inside.

Hmm, but when I look at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3( is the outermost, and each subsequent 3( is nested inside. So, how many 3( are there? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nYes, 9 times. So, 9 layers. Each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, let's compute each step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1 to L9, where L9 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L8: 3*(1 + L9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, hold on. Each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, L8 is 3*(1 + L9). So, if L9 is 4, then L8 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, L7: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL1: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so the final result is 36084? Hmm, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from L9:\n\nL9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. Let me verify each multiplication:\n\n- 3*5 is 15, correct.\n\n- 3*16: 16*3 is 48, correct.\n\n- 3*49: 49*3 is 147, correct.\n\n- 3*148: 148*3. Let's compute 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 300+120=420, 420+24=444. Correct.\n\n- 3*445: 400*3=1200, 45*3=135. 1200+135=1335. Correct.\n\n- 3*1336: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 36*3=108. So, 3000+900=3900, 3900+108=4008. Correct.\n\n- 3*4009: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\n- 3*12028: Let's compute 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So, 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each time, we're doing 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3. Hmm, maybe we can model this as a geometric series or find a formula.\n\nLet me see, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nIf I let a_1 = 4 (the innermost), then a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, that's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C. Assume a_n = C, then C = 3*(1 + C).\n\nSo, C = 3 + 3C\n\nSubtract 3C from both sides: -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5\n\nAdd 1.5 to both sides: 5.5 = 3A => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11*3^{n}) / 6\n\nAnd subtract 3/2, which is 9/6.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 as the innermost. So, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the problem, the innermost is a_1, and each layer outwards is a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9. So, the final result is a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6\n\nCompute that:\n\n6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3\n\n6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0\n\n6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5\n\n6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2\n\n6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute step by step:\n\n216,504 \u00f7 6\n\nFirst, 216 \u00f7 6 = 36\n\nThen, 504 \u00f7 6 = 84\n\nSo, 36 and 84 together make 36,840.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent because 6*36,840 = 221,040, which is more than 216,504. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me compute 216,504 \u00f7 6:\n\nDivide each digit by 6:\n\n2 \u00f7 6 = 0 with remainder 2\n\n21 \u00f7 6 = 3 with remainder 3\n\n36 \u00f7 6 = 6 with remainder 0\n\n0 \u00f7 6 = 0\n\n5 \u00f7 6 = 0 with remainder 5\n\n50 \u00f7 6 = 8 with remainder 2\n\n24 \u00f7 6 = 4 with remainder 0\n\nSo, writing the digits: 0 3 6 0 0 8 4, but we can ignore leading zeros.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as:\n\n6 | 216,504\n\n6 into 2 is 0, remainder 2.\n\nBring down 1: 21. 6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3.\n\nBring down 6: 36. 6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0.\n\nBring down 5: 05. 6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5.\n\nBring down 0: 50. 6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2.\n\nBring down 4: 24. 6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0.\n\nSo, the quotient is 36,084.\n\nSo, 216,504 \u00f7 6 = 36,084.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = 36,084.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nGoing back:\n\nL9: 4\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, each step is correct. So, I'm confident the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(3(1 + \\text{previous layer})\\). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer's value is computed and substituted into the next outer layer. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached, resulting in the final value of 36,084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to parse it step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me see if I can break it down from the inside out. Nested expressions usually require starting from the innermost parentheses and working your way outward. So, the innermost part here is 1 + 3, right?\n\nLet me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the inside, each time there's a 1 + 3 inside another set of parentheses multiplied by 3. Hmm, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, so I think the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression.\n\nWait, maybe I should write this out step by step. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNext, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Plus 1 is 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Plus 1 is 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So after computing L9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit is 2*3=6 +2=8.\nAnd the next digit is 0, since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, maybe I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because this seems a bit large, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9, so 9 layers. So starting from L1 as 1+3, then L2 as 1 + 3*(L1), up to L9 as 1 + 3*(L8). Then the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, but when I computed L9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I should check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So the final answer should be 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in each step.\n\nWait, let me check L7 again: 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 3279 +1 is 3280. That seems correct.\n\nL8: 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 3*9841. Let me compute this again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 29523 +1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n2\u00d73=6, 5\u00d73=15, 9\u00d73=27, 2\u00d73=6, 4\u00d73=12.\n\nWait, but writing it out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because the number seems quite large. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nLet me think: the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). So each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with the exponents. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo a_9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nOkay, that seems solid. I think I've got the right answer here.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution which confirms the result. The final value is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It looks like each part is 3 times something, and inside each something, there's another 1 plus 3 times another expression. So it's like a chain of these 3(1 + ...) expressions. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built recursively, meaning each part repeats the same structure. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. Let me try to break it down.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one level out, each expression is 3 times (1 + the result of the inner expression).\n3. I'll need to compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me write down each level separately. I'll start by assigning variables to each level to keep track.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Level 1: (1 + 3)\n- Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1)\n- Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2)\n- And so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses.

Let me try to parse it.\n\nStarting from the outermost 3:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo each time, it's 3*(1 + next level). Let me see how many levels there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3*(...). So how many times does this happen?

Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of levels is 9, as there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)) inside each other.\n\nWait, maybe I should just compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, each level is 3*(1 + previous level). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, that's the first innermost part.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have 3*(1 + previous level). So let's list them step by step.\n\nLet me try to write each level clearly:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Level 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Level 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Level 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Level 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Level 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Level 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so after 9 levels, the value is 36,084.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the levels correctly because the problem seems to have 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so starting from the first 3, the number of \"1+\" sections is 9, meaning there are 9 levels of nesting.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, after 9 levels, the value is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Level 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Level 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Level 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Level 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Level 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Level 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Level 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize? Each level seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the results:\n\nLevel 1: 4\nLevel 2: 15\nLevel 3: 48\nLevel 4: 147\nLevel 5: 444\nLevel 6: 1335\nLevel 7: 4008\nLevel 8: 12027\nLevel 9: 36084\n\nHmm, each time, the value is 3*(1 + previous value). So, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me see if I can find a general formula for this recursion.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at level n.\n\nThen, a_1 = 4\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n > 1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nWait, no, wait: 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nTo solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nWait, because 3/2 is 9/6, so:\n\n(11/6)*3^n - 9/6 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9 first:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = let's compute:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196,830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19,683\n\nSo, total is 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n216,504 \u00f7 6\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nYes, 3^9 is 19,683. 11 times that is 216,513. Subtract 9 gives 216,504. Divided by 6 is 36,084. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as each step being 3*(1 + previous step). So, starting from 4, each time we multiply by 3 and add 3.\n\nBut since I've already calculated it step by step and also derived the formula, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, the computed value is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, using the recurrence relation $a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1})$ with $a_1 = 4$. After computing each level up to $a_9$, we find the result to be 36,084.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " It's a bit of a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me take a look:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can work from the inside out? That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. I think the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let's start there.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me see. The innermost part is the last (1 + 3), so actually, each level is a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me try to write down each layer. There are nine layers of 3(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times that entire expression. So after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. When I was computing the layers, I started with Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, and so on. But the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, is that the correct approach?\n\nWait, let me verify. Each time, I computed Layer n as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3*(something). So, if I compute Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut maybe I should check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something. Let me see if there's a pattern.\n\nEach layer seems to follow a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the first layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nYes, so the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum. Let me see:\n\nEach time, we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, which is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer numerically, keeping track of the value as I go.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nCompute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, compute (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext, (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext, (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext, (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext, (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext, (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext, (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents.\n\nSince each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, expanding it, it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, because each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^9.\n\nWait, but let me think.\n\nWait, actually, when you have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), it's similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n.\n\nBut in this case, how many terms do we have?\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, which is 3, then each layer adds a term.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12.\n\nThen, next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39.\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous value).\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value after 9 layers.\n\nWhich we found to be 29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that includes 1 and another term.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to stick with the step-by-step approach.\n\nSo, to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, total expression: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4, and we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer numerically again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - Final result: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nAnswer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I need to compute the value step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse this. It seems like each part is a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions, right?\n\nSo, starting from the very inside, I see the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. Then, moving one step out, I'll have another (1 + 3(something)), and so on until I get to the outermost part.\n\nLet me write down each step as I go. I'll number them from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3)\n2. Then, compute the next one out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Continue this process until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nLet me start.\n\n**Step 1: Compute (1 + 3)**\nThat's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1)**\nSo, we have 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3*4, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the next layer is 13.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that.\n\n3*13 is 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, the next layer is 40.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that.\n\n3*40 is 120. Then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, the next layer is 121.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(121). Let me calculate that.\n\n3*121 is 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, the next layer is 364.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 5)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that.\n\n3*364: Hmm, 364*3. Let me break that down. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1093.\n\n**Step 7: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that.\n\n3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, the next layer is 3280.\n\n**Step 8: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, the next layer is 9841.\n\n**Step 9: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8)**\nSo, 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that.\n\n3*9841: Let me break this down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the next layer is 29524.\n\n**Step 10: Compute the outermost layer: 3*(result from Step 9)**\nSo, 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in that last multiplication. 3*29524. Let me compute it another way to verify.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each step is just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, except for the innermost step which is just adding 3. It's like a geometric progression but each term is built by the previous one. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression?\n\nWait, let me think. If I have an expression like a + a(a + a(a + ...))), it's similar to a continued multiplication and addition. But I'm not sure if I can find a closed-form formula for it. Maybe it's just easier to compute step by step as I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this expression can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each step as a term a_n, where n is the depth from the inside. So, starting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier steps.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all the steps. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this makes sense. Each time, the value is tripling and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth. It's interesting how quickly the numbers grow. Using the recurrence relation helped me verify the result without having to compute each step manually, which might have been error-prone, especially with so many layers.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and decide to compute from the inside out.\n2. Computed each layer step-by-step, starting with the innermost parentheses.\n3. After computing each layer, used the result in the next outer layer.\n4. Reaching the outermost layer, multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n5. Verified the result using a recurrence relation approach, confirming that each step was correct.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also showed the power of mathematical formulas in simplifying what initially seems like a tedious computation.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check one of the middle steps again. Let's take step 5: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Then step 6: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, step 7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nAnd step 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524: 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost outwards:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\n10. Compute the outermost layer: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThus, the value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression starts with 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, there's a 1 plus another 3 multiplied by another parenthesis, and this pattern continues.

That means I'll have 9 steps to compute from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLet me write each step down, starting from step 1 as the innermost.\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to step 2: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4.\n\n3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 2 result: 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 3 result: 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 4 result: 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 5 result: 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So, 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 6 result: 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 7 result: 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 8 result: 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 = let's compute that. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 9 result: 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from step 9. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to get lost with so many levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But wait, let me check one of the multiplication steps again to be sure. For example, step 9: 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nAnd then 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I did it right. Each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, each step is three times the previous plus one. That seems like a geometric progression or something.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each step is 1 + 3*(previous), starting from 4, then 13, 40, etc. Maybe it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step, and each step checks out, I think 88572 is the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another approach or check with a calculator, but since I can't use a calculator, I'll try to see if the pattern makes sense.\n\nLet me list the results again:\n\nStep 1: 4\n\nStep 2: 13\n\nStep 3: 40\n\nStep 4: 121\n\nStep 5: 364\n\nStep 6: 1093\n\nStep 7: 3280\n\nStep 8: 9841\n\nStep 9: 29524\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each step is 3 times the previous step plus 1. So, it's like a recurrence relation where a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1.\n\nIf I recall, such a recurrence has a closed-form solution. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a(n) = k*a(n-1) + c is a(n) = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, k=3, c=1. So, the closed-form would be a(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the initial conditions. Let's say n starts at 1, where a(1)=4.\n\nSo, a(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nAnd for n=0, maybe? Wait, but in our case, the innermost step is step 1, which is 4. So, if we think of step 1 as n=1, then step 9 is n=9.\n\nWait, maybe I can express a(n) as A*3^n + B.\n\nBut let's see, if n=1, a(1)=4=3A + B.\n\nIf n=2, a(2)=13=9A + B.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nThen, plugging back into equation 1: 3*(1.5) + B = 4 => 4.5 + B = 4 => B = -0.5.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for step n, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWow, that works! So, the closed-form formula is a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for step 9, a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Using the closed-form formula, I can compute it directly without going through each step, which might be faster for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, both methods work.\n\nI think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down into 9 levels of nesting, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Use the result from the previous step:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. \n\nLet me try to break it down. The expression is a series of 3 multiplied by (1 plus another expression). Each time, the expression inside the parentheses is similar but has one fewer layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. \n\nLet me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1 + 3. So, that's 4. \n\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\n3. Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's see, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 is 88572.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me check each step again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\n10. 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000=87000, 87000 + 1500=88500, 88500 + 72=88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it before, I thought 3*29524 was 88572, but let me confirm:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing up to 9 layers because the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\). So, counting the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections: starting from the innermost, each time you have a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\nStarting from the first after the 3: 1 + 3(...\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen each layer wraps another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time you have a new 1 + 3(...). So, let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n- And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Each time you have a new 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each additional layer adds another 1 + 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is for the first 1 + 3(...)\n\nThen each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, how many ( are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3\n\nWait, so from the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", right? Because each time you have a new \"1 + 3(\", except the last one which ends with 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer, so how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur?\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(, then inside that another 1 + 3(, and so on until the last one which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, which is 9 times? Wait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n3. Then: 1 + 3(\n4. Then: 1 + 3(\n5. Then: 1 + 3(\n6. Then: 1 + 3(\n7. Then: 1 + 3(\n8. Then: 1 + 3(\n9. Then: 1 + 3\n\nSo, that's 9 layers in total. So, I computed 9 layers, each time starting from the innermost and moving outward. So, the final result is 88,572. \n\nWait, but when I computed step by step, I went through 10 steps, but maybe that's because I included the final multiplication by 3 as the 10th step. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to the innermost being layer 1 up to layer 9, and then the final 3*result.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the initial 3 is multiplied by the 9th layer's result. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to compute it again, perhaps in a table form, to make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nLet me create a table where each row represents a layer, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds upon the previous one, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller version: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, three layers.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 3*(13) = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, the result is 120, which matches the step-by-step approach.\n\nSo, if I apply the same method to the original problem, which has 9 layers inside, I should get the correct result.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct: 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one more layer and see.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). As above, that's 120.\n\nIf I add another layer: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) = 3*121 = 363? Wait, no, wait: Let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, no, in the four-layer example, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nSo, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each additional layer adds another multiplication and addition.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, which has 9 layers inside, the result is 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident enough that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to parse it step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like a recursive kind of problem, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can compute it from the innermost part outwards. That seems like a good strategy because each step only depends on the one before it.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, we add 1 to that result. So, the next step is 1 + 12.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAgain, moving outward, we have 3 times this result.\n\nFourth layer: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAdding 1 again.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\nSixth layer: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAdd 1.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\nEighth layer: 3*121 = 363.\n\nAdd 1.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nMultiply by 3.\n\nTenth layer: 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds a layer. Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I replace the innermost part with its value, so each step reduces the number of layers by one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see:\n\nEach time it's 3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step wraps another 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one. Let's see:\n\nEach 3 corresponds to a layer. The innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds a 3 outside. So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time you have a 3(...), so let's count the number of 3s after the initial one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is one pair, then each layer adds another pair. So, let's count the number of closing parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's a closing parenthesis after each 3. Let me count the number of closing parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another ). So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time you have a 3 multiplied by something, which is (1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me try to write down each step with the corresponding layer.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 3*9841 = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like 10 layers, but when I count the number of 3s, it's 9. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to compute each step one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me number each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12; then (1 + 12) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*13 = 39; then (1 + 39) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*40 = 120; then (1 + 120) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) = 3*121 = 363; then (1 + 363) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*364 = 1092; then (1 + 1092) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) = 3*1093 = 3279; then (1 + 3279) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*3280 = 9840; then (1 + 9840) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523; then (1 + 29523) = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost 3 multiplies Layer 9's result.\n\nSo, Layer 10: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841 = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here. Let me think.\n\nEach layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, but starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, that doesn't match what I had before. Wait, maybe I'm misdefining the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define it differently. Let me think again.\n\nLet me define a_1 as the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer outwards is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, but in my previous step-by-step, after a_1=4, I had a_2=3*4=12, then 1 + 12=13. So, perhaps the formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier steps. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), so starting from a_1=4.\n\nThen, a_2=3*(1 + a_1)=3*(1+4)=15.\n\nBut in my step-by-step earlier, after a_1=4, I had 3*4=12, then 1 + 12=13, which would be a_2=13.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIf a_1 = 4,\n\nThen a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had a_2=13, which is 3*4 +1=13.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nLet me test that.\n\nIf a_1=4,\n\na_2=3*4 +1=13,\n\na_3=3*13 +1=40,\n\na_4=3*40 +1=121,\n\na_5=3*121 +1=364,\n\na_6=3*364 +1=1093,\n\na_7=3*1093 +1=3280,\n\na_8=3*3280 +1=9841,\n\na_9=3*9841 +1=29524,\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1), but I need to check.\n\nWait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nWait, actually, in the standard form, it's a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, so here k=3, c=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1.\n\nSo, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify with a smaller example to make sure my approach is right.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute that step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 =4\n\nNext: 3*4=12; 1 +12=13\n\nNext: 3*13=39; 1 +39=40\n\nOutermost: 3*40=120\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, n=3 layers.\n\na_1=4\n\na_2=3*4 +1=13\n\na_3=3*13 +1=40\n\nThen, outermost 3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, applying it to 9 layers gives a_9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\), then \\(1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\), then \\(1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\), then \\(1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 121 = 363\\), then \\(1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times 364 = 1092\\), then \\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7.

    "text": " It's a bit of a long expression with a lot of nested parentheses and multiplication by 3 each time. Let me try to break it down step by step because it looks a bit intimidating at first glance. \n\nThe problem is: Compute \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a 1 + 3(...), so I think each layer is another set of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3( result from step 1 )\n3. 1 + 3( result from step 2 )\n...\nAnd this continues until the outermost layer. I think there are nine layers in total because each \"1 +\" is followed by another 3 times something, and I can see nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 has another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis is part of a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nI think each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let's see, the expression is 3 times something, and that something is 1 + 3 times something else, and so on. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write down each step. Let me try to write each layer one by one.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's see, 29524 * 3. 29,524 times 3. Let's compute that.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nSo adding those up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo the total would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because I might have miscounted. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't skip any layers. Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) operation. Starting from the innermost, each time I go out one layer, I add another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) until Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so I think I have 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then the final 3*(Layer 9 result). So that would be 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut let me check again because sometimes when I count layers, I might miscount the number. Let me try to see how many times the expression 1 + 3*(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo that's 9 layers. So, each time, I have to compute from the innermost to the 9th layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I did the layers, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the sequence would be:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, as before.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88,572. So that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when I'm dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, so 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did earlier, and arrived at the same result. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFrom a_8=9841, a_9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524, which matches the formula.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nwe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " Let me read it again: Compute 3 times a big expression with a lot of nested parentheses. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. I think I need to simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should note that the expression is a series of nested 1+3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. It looks like each level is 3 times (1 plus something). So maybe each step is similar, and perhaps there's a pattern I can exploit instead of computing each layer one by one. But maybe I should just start computing from the inside out to see what happens.\n\nLet me write down the expression more clearly. Starting from the innermost part:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1+3. Then, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))... Hmm, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So the total expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))... So how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3(1+3(...) appears.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo starting from the innermost, 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So the number of layers is 9? Because each time you have a new 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of 3(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1+3) = 3*4 = 12, but in the expression, it's 3*(1+3*(...)), so perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So let me list each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3: Let's do 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, so the total expression is 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo each 3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. So the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) terms.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo starting from the innermost, 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3(1+3(...) appears.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3(, we have 1+3(, which is another layer, and so on. So let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 8 more 3(1+3(...) terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but when I counted before, I had 9 layers, ending at Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recurrence relation. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3^{10} to be sure.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, so 3^{10} is indeed 59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by computing each layer using the formula.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = 121, correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = 364, correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = 1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = 3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nExpanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0.\n\nWait, but a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but using the formula, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_0.\n\nWait, but a_0 is undefined here, because our initial term is a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence and the closed-form solution.\n\nIn any case, I think I've verified it enough times.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer, used a closed-form formula, and verified the arithmetic. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\nWe define each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).\n\nCalculating \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n\n\\[\n29524 \\times 3 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers. It looks like each layer is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1 inside another set of parentheses. I think I need to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me see how that goes.\n\nStarting from the very inside, I see the expression: 1 + 3. That's the innermost part. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, I see another 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Wait, no, let me check. The next layer is 1 + 3*(the result of the innermost expression). So, substituting the innermost result, it's 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Hmm, maybe I should represent this as a recursive expression or something.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward.\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n3. Then: 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n5. And so on, until we go through all nine layers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to number each layer from the inside out. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, there's a 1 + 3(...) multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is the last one, let's say that's layer 1, and then each previous one is another layer.\n\nWait, actually, I think there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is the last 1 + 3, then each previous one adds another layer. So, perhaps there are nine layers total. Let me count the number of 3's multiplied by the parentheses: each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(that), then 3*(that), and so on. Maybe it's better to work step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer after the innermost is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, we compute the inner expression first, then plug it into the outer one.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Let's compute that:\n\nInnermost expression (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, moving another layer out, we have 3*(Layer 2) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but hold on, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, after computing the inner part, we have 3*(1 + 3*(inner)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, that seems different from what I thought earlier. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)). So, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, Layer 3 would be 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nWait, that seems like a big jump. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to visualize the structure more clearly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, perhaps? Wait, no, let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...) terms.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time, moving outward, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of times we apply this 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is equal to the number of layers minus one, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work step by step, computing each layer and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nWait, that seems correct so far. Let me continue.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that last step carefully.\n\nFirst, 3*20925489: Let me compute that.\n\n20925489 * 3:\n\n20,000,000 * 3 = 60,000,000\n\n925,489 * 3: 900,000*3=2,700,000; 25,489*3=76,467\n\nSo total: 60,000,000 + 2,700,000 + 76,467 = 62,776,467\n\nSo, 3*20925489 = 62,776,467\n\nThen, 1 + 62,776,467 = 62,776,468\n\nNow, 3*62,776,468 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\n\n2,776,468 * 3: Let's compute 2,000,000*3=6,000,000; 776,468*3=2,329,404\n\nSo, 6,000,000 + 2,329,404 = 8,329,404\n\nAdding to 180,000,000: 180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 3*62,776,468:\n\nCompute 62,776,468 * 3:\n\n62,000,000 * 3 = 186,000,000\n\n776,468 * 3: 700,000*3=2,100,000; 76,468*3=229,404\n\nSo, 2,100,000 + 229,404 = 2,329,404\n\nAdding to 186,000,000: 186,000,000 + 2,329,404 = 188,329,404\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so does that mean that Layer 9 is the entire expression? Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost (Layer 1: 1 + 3), then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)), Layer 3 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is applied, it's 8 times, right? Because starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there are 8 more layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), right? Because starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each time moving outward, you have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 188,329,404. But let me check: how many times do we apply 3*(1 + 3*(...))?\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time moving outward, we apply 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, the number of applications is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count them.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). Let's count how many times we have this structure.\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*86113 = 258339\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*775018 = 2325054\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*6975163 = 20925489\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*62776468 = 188,329,404\n\nSo, according to this, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of these steps.\n\nLet me verify each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704\n\nWait, 3*9568: 9000*3=27,000; 568*3=1,704. So, 27,000 + 1,704 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339\n\nWait, 86,113 * 3: 80,000*3=240,000; 6,113*3=18,339. So, 240,000 + 18,339 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nWait, 775,018 * 3: 700,000*3=2,100,000; 75,018*3=225,054. So, 2,100,000 + 225,054 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nWait, 6,975,163 * 3: 6,000,000*3=18,000,000; 975,163*3=2,925,489. So, 18,000,000 + 2,925,489 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing so rapidly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this without computing each layer step by step, which might help confirm if 188,329,404 is the correct answer.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1})\n\nWait, so a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a recursive formula, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*9^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3 + 9*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 9*C = 3 => -8*C = 3 => C = -3/8\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*9^n + (-3/8)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*9^1 + (-3/8) = 9A - 3/8 = 4\n\nSo, 9A = 4 + 3/8 = 35/8\n\nThus, A = (35/8)/9 = 35/(72)\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nWe can write 9^n as 9*9^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to compute it directly.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8\n\nWait, let me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute 9^9.\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489\n\nNow, (35/72)*387,420,489\n\nCompute 387,420,489 * 35 = ?\n\nWell, 387,420,489 * 35 = 387,420,489 * (30 + 5) = 387,420,489*30 + 387,420,489*5\n\n387,420,489 * 30 = 11,622,614,670\n\n387,420,489 * 5 = 1,937,102,445\n\nAdding together: 11,622,614,670 + 1,937,102,445 = 13,559,717,115\n\nNow, divide by 72:\n\n13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n72 * 188,329,404 = ?\n\nWait, 72 * 188,329,404\n\nLet me compute 188,329,404 * 70 = 13,183,058,280\n\n188,329,404 * 2 = 376,658,808\n\nAdding together: 13,183,058,280 + 376,658,808 = 13,559,717,088\n\nWait, but our numerator was 13,559,717,115, which is 27 more than 13,559,717,088.\n\nSo, 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72 = 188,329,404 + 27/72 = 188,329,404 + 3/8\n\nSo, (35/72)*9^9 = 188,329,404 + 3/8\n\nNow, subtract 3/8: 188,329,404 + 3/8 - 3/8 = 188,329,404\n\nSo, a_9 = 188,329,404\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by step-by-step computation. So, that seems to confirm that the answer is indeed 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the general formula, let me test it for a smaller n.\n\nFor example, let's check n=2.\n\na_2 should be 39.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = (35/72)*9^2 - 3/8\n\n9^2 = 81\n\nSo, (35/72)*81 = (35*81)/72 = (2835)/72 = 39.4375\n\nThen, subtract 3/8: 39.4375 - 0.375 = 39.0625\n\nWait, that's 39.0625, but a_2 is 39. Hmm, that's a problem. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me go back.\n\nWait, when I solved the recurrence, I got a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nBut when n=2, a_2 should be 39.\n\nCompute (35/72)*81 - 3/8:\n\n35/72 * 81 = (35*81)/72 = (35*9*9)/(8*9) )= (35*9)/8 = 315/8 = 39.375\n\n39.375 - 0.375 = 39. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me check again.\n\n35/72 * 81 = (35 * 81) /72\n\n81 divided by 72 is 9/8, so 35 * 9/8 = 315/8 = 39.375\n\nThen, 39.375 - 0.375 = 39, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=3.\n\na_3 should be 354.\n\nCompute (35/72)*9^3 - 3/8\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n35/72 * 729 = (35*729)/72\n\n729 \u00f7 72 = 10.125\n\n35*10.125 = 354.375\n\n354.375 - 0.375 = 354, which is correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. So, for n=9, a_9 = 188,329,404.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was computing the layers step by step, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2 as 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39, and so on up to Layer 9 as 188,329,404.\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich, when starting from the innermost, is 1 + 3, then each time, moving outward, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the initial 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I considered that the first layer is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous)). So, after 9 layers, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nBut let me make sure that the initial 3 is included correctly. Because in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the very first 3 is outside the entire inner expression. So, if I have 9 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then the total number of 3* operations would be 9, leading to the result being 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but in the formula, I considered a_n where n=9, which gives 188,329,404, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1})\n\nWhich is a_n = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, which I solved earlier, leading to a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to express this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous). So, each step is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous). So, perhaps the total expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nWait, but in any case, my step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution both give me 188,329,404, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a few more layers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nWait, I've already computed up to Layer 9, and the result matches both the step-by-step and the formula, so I think I'm confident that 188,329,404 is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value grows exponentially. Using both step-by-step computation and a derived closed-form formula, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{188329404}$"

    "text": " It's this long expression with a bunch of nested parentheses and 3s. Let me write it down to see it more clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. It looks like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern or something I can exploit instead of just computing each one step by step. But since it's only 9 layers deep, maybe computing each step isn't too bad. Let me try to break it down from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's simple, right? 1 plus 3 is 4. So I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4.\n\nSo now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Wait, that's 1 plus 3 times 4. Hmm, I need to remember the order of operations: multiplication before addition. So 3 times 4 is 12, then add 1. So 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3(13). Again, I'll do the multiplication first. 3 times 13 is 39, then add 1, which gives me 40.\n\nMoving another layer out, it's 1 + 3(40). Let's compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3(121). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nThen, the next one: 1 + 3(364). 3 times 364 is... let me calculate that. 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1, so 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3(1093). Hmm, 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Add 1, so 3280.\n\nMoving another step out: 1 + 3(3280). Let's compute 3 times 3280. 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1, so 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3(9841). Let's see, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Add 1, so 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3 times that result. So 3 times 29524. Let me break that down. 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. Wait, actually, maybe I should do it more carefully.\n\nWait, 29524 times 3. Let's compute:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 x 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 x 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 x 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 x 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 x 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 x 3:\n\n20000 x 3 = 60000\n\n9000 x 3 = 27000\n\n500 x 3 = 1500\n\n20 x 3 = 60\n\n4 x 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches.\n\nSo the final result is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYeah, that seems consistent each time. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step.\n\n1.

It looks like each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and then multiplied by 3 again. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually seems to be the strategy with these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to parse this. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So, starting from there.

So, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I compute a layer, I'm going one step out. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Or is it 9 layers inside and then the outermost 3? Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, in the original expression, I see that after the first 3*(, there are nine instances of (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the innermost is Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, there are nine layers inside, and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, let me try again, perhaps I overcomplicated it before.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many times 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are nine \"1+3(\" instances, right? So, that would mean nine layers inside, and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I'm a bit concerned that maybe I miscounted the layers, because sometimes it's easy to miscount the number of nested parentheses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions of the form a + a*r + a*r^2 + ... + a*r^n can be represented as a geometric series, but in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(...), which seems to be a recursive structure.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Assume L_n = d, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nd = 3*d + 1\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd - 3d = 1 \u2192 -2d = 1 \u2192 d = -1/2.\n\nHmm, so the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=0 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is L_0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is (1 + 3) = 4, which would be L_1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer adds another exponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the indices. Let me define L_1 as the innermost layer, which is 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the general solution L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, how many layers do we have? Let's see, starting from the innermost as L_1 = 4, then L_2, up to L_9, because there are nine \"1 + 3(\" layers. So, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nNow, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144.\n\nThen, 177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before, 88572.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent with my step-by-step computation earlier. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify the number of layers. The original expression has nine \"1 + 3(\" layers, so n=9, which would mean L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nAnd 3^{11} is indeed 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{11} directly:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go back to my initial step-by-step computation. I had nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer), and ended up with 29524 at Layer 9, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the formula approach. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the step-by-step computation, but let me just verify one or two layers again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that's all correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like each layer is a 3 multiplied by something inside parentheses, and inside each set of parentheses, it's 1 plus another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these operations. I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outward because that's how parentheses usually work\u2014you solve the innermost ones first.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. Let's see, starting from the innermost part:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that innermost part with 4. So, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I should number each layer so I don't get confused. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplying a parenthesis, that's a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n... and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" starts a new layer, so how many are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are nine layers here. So, I need to compute starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, and work my way out to Layer 1.\n\nSo, Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). So, after computing Layer 1 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3.\n\nLet me write it down step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the number is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm that 29524*3 is indeed 88572.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Because when I was computing Layer 1 as 29524, that was 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and Layer 2 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helps prevent mistakes. I don't see any errors in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

It looks like a recursive expression where each part is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. I'll start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3).

Let me try to compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36084. So, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me try to compute it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the 9th term is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, because a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 3\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 3/2 = (8/2 + 3/2) = 11/2.\n\nThus, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nNow, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. I'll just recap:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 3. After 9 layers, the result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I also get 36084.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, we arrive at the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 3*(1 + previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute from Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. Solving this gives a closed-form solution, confirming that a_9 = 36084.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. So, let me write it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Wait, no, let me check again. The next level is 1 + 3 times something. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number the parentheses to make it clearer. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, maybe there are 8 layers here? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, the next one is 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next one is 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost one.\n\nWait, let me count how many times this happens. Let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. Each time, inside the 3*(...), there's another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many levels are there?\n\nLet me try to count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, the next level is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Then, the next level is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next, 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next, 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Finally, the outermost is 3*(9841) = ?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted correctly. Each time, I'm moving one level out, so maybe there are 9 levels? Let me see: starting from the innermost, each step is a new level.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time you go in, you add another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside each other:\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and this happens 8 times, with the outermost being multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the innermost is the 9th level? Hmm, maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me try to break it down from the inside out, writing each step.\n\nStep 1: Innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next level is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next level is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next level is 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Next level is 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Next level is 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next level is 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next level is 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost expression is 3*(9841) = ?\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That's correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*9841. Let me compute that.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, the final result is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. Let me check the last multiplication again.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, adding:\n\n27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 9841 * 3 directly:\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\n3 * 4 = 12 (carryover 1)\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 (carryover 2)\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 2 = 29.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n3\nx9841\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 29,523.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about how many levels there are. Let me count again to make sure I didn't miss a step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 3*(9841) = 29,523\n\nWait, so that's 9 steps. But the original problem seems to have 8 layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nEach time after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting with the first 3*(...), the inside is 1 + 3*(...). Each time, the inside is another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new level. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n\nSo, 8 opening parentheses after the first 3. Therefore, the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each level adds another 1 + 3*(...), so that would be 8 layers, right? So, that would mean 8 steps from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I did the steps earlier, I went up to 9 steps, including the outermost multiplication by 3. So, maybe I have 8 inner steps and then the outermost multiplication. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the innermost being the first step, then each time moving outwards, so 8 times 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, that would make 8 inner expressions, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the final 3*(last result).\n\nWait, so in that case, the innermost is step 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, step 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\nThen, step 9: 3*(9841) = 29,523.\n\nBut since the problem says 3*(1 + 3*(...)), with 8 layers, that would mean 8 times 1 + 3*(...), so that would be 8 steps before the outermost 3*(...). So, in that case, the final step is 3*(result after 8 steps). So, yes, 9 steps in total, but 8 inner steps and then the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of 1 + 3 expressions, there are 8 of them inside the 3*(...). So, maybe my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, if I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_8, and then the final result is 3*a_8.\n\nSo, let me try that approach.\n\nDefine a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with what I did earlier. So, the answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me recompute each a_i step by step.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*9,841 = 29,523. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, right?\n\nWait, no, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_8 = 9841, and the final result is 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the final result would be 3*a_8 = 3*(3^9 - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59,049, so (59,049 - 3)/2 = 59,046/2 = 29,523. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without expanding each step. But since the problem is about computing it step by step, maybe I should stick to the iterative approach.\n\nBut just to make sure, I can compute 3^{10} as 59,049, then subtract 3 to get 59,046, divide by 2 to get 29,523. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs inside the 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers inside the 3*(...) is 8, meaning that a_8 is the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...):\n\nEach time after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3*(...), and each of those has another 1 + 3*(...), and so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 8) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that's 8 levels inside the 3*(...), so the final result is 29,523.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, the answer should be 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1.

    "text": " It's this long expression with a bunch of nested parentheses and threes. Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. It looks like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit instead of just brute-forcing it step by step. But since I'm not sure, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the innermost, the first one is (1 + 3), then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are nine sets of parentheses. That means I need to compute the innermost one first and then work my way outward, each time substituting the result back into the next layer.\n\nAlright, let's start with the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So I can replace the innermost (1 + 3) with 4. So the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe I should work from the inside out, replacing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step, layer by layer. Maybe I can write each step down to keep track.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo starting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out to L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So L2 is 13.\n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So L3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So L4 is 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. So L5 is 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. So L6 is 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. So L7 is 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. So L8 is 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841 is... let me calculate that. 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 1 + 29523 is 29524. So L9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nI can break this down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3 = 1572. So adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again to see if I made any mistakes.\n\nStarting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not right. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nSo 2*10000*3 = 6*10000 = 60000\n\n9*1000*3 = 27*1000 = 27000\n\n5*100*3 = 15*100 = 1500\n\n2*10*3 = 6*10 = 60\n\n4*1*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot, but let me check if each step was correct.\n\nWait, another way to compute 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly, because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo that's nine layers, right? Each time, you have 1 + 3*(next layer). So I started from the innermost, which was (1 + 3), and worked my way out through each layer, computing each L1 to L9 correctly.\n\nWait, but let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 L1=4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(L1) \u2192 L2=13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(L2) \u2192 L3=40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(L3) \u2192 L4=121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(L4) \u2192 L5=364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(L5) \u2192 L6=1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(L6) \u2192 L7=3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(L7) \u2192 L8=9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(L8) \u2192 L9=29524\n\nSo yes, that's nine layers, each computed correctly. Then the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in each step.\n\nLet me verify each computation:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinal step: 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So I think I did it correctly. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\n=> -2A = 1\n\n=> A = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and solving it, which gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So each time, I compute the innermost and substitute.\n\nSo:\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me define the innermost as a0 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so a8 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a8, which would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is 3*(a8), so that would be 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem has nine sets of parentheses, so from a0 to a8, which is nine layers. So that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3(...). So the problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time adding another 1+3*(...). So from the innermost, that's nine layers. So a0 to a8, which is nine layers, so a8 is the outermost inside the initial 3*(...). So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*(a8) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe it's a geometric series or something, but the way it's built up with each step multiplying by 3 and adding 1 seems like each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence.\n\nLet me see if I can model this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, a0 was 1 + 3 = 4, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if this recurrence has a closed-form solution, just to verify.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where B is a particular solution.\n\nIn this case, c=3, d=1.\n\nSo the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume B is a constant.\n\nSo substituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a0 = 4.\n\nAt n=0: a0 = A*3^0 - 1/2 = A - 1/2 = 4 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo the closed-form solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=8, a8 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo a8 = (9*6561 - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So a8 = 29,524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a8 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the steps.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n\n\nWait, but that's not exactly the case here because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so the expansion would be:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n+1}\n\nWait, no, let me think. If we have a recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then expanding:\n\na1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{-1}), but a_{-1} is undefined here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form solution, which we found as a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=8, a8 = (9*6561 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a8 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't find any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer (L9): \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer (L8): \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer (L7): \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer (L6): \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer (L5): \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer (L4): \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer (L3): \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer (L2): \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer (L1): \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me read it again: Compute 3 times this big expression, which is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression, and this seems to go on for a while. Let me write it out step by step so I can see it better.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think I need to work from the innermost part outwards. Let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something, and this seems to happen multiple times. Let me see, starting from the innermost, there's a 1 + 3, then each time we go out, it's 1 + 3 times the previous expression. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: after the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) is another layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3). Then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s after each opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's see how many times this happens. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...)) is another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLet me parse this:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is outside the first (1 + 3(...)).\n\nInside that, we have 1 + 3(...), and then inside that another 1 + 3(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by the next expression. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"3(\" appears, right? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), so that's the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another 1 + 3(...), that's the second layer.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me try to count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. So, each time I go in, I see another 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me try to count the number of 3s inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times the pattern 1 + 3(...) repeats. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3.\n\nThen moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous expression).\n\nSo, the first innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n\nThen the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nSo, each time, we add another layer. Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression, I think there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time you go in, you have another 1 + 3*(...), and there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's 8 layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside is (1 + 3(...)), and each time we have another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, let me count the number of opening parentheses: after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, because each time you have a new (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let me look again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try to count the number of times \"3(\" appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see the number of times 3 is multiplied by something. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is the last part: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nSo, each time we move out, we add another layer of 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 more layers of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside that, we have 8 more layers of 1 + 3*(...). Because the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the ninth layer? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outwards.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote E_n as the expression at the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2.\n\nAnd so on, until E_9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E_9).\n\nWait, maybe it's 8 layers? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3s inside the expression.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because each time you have a 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer, then each 3*(...) is another layer.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so the innermost expression is E_1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So, if I go up to E_9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*E_9, right?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's E_1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*E_n, so E_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(E_9), right? So, yes, 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524: let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, no, wait: 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nSo:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, so 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nYes, because 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E_9.\n\nSo, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might miscount the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3.\n\nThen, each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it's (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer, then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers is that?\n\nWell, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each time you have another layer.\n\nSo, in the original expression, after the first 3, there are 8 more layers of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, so that would make it 9 layers in total, right? Because starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each time you go out, you add another layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to E_9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of times \"3(\" appears.\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each time there's a \"3(\", so let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n\nSo, each time, we have a \"3(\".\n\nLet me count how many \"3(\" there are.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, the next is 3(, then another 3(, and so on.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nThen inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), so that's 2.\n\nContinuing, 3(1 + 3(...)), that's 3.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3.\n\nLet me see:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have a \"3(\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nThen, inside that, another 3(, so that's 2.\n\nContinuing, each time we have another 3(.\n\nSo, counting each \"3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nAnd then the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another \"3(\", so total \"3(\" after the first 3 is 8.\n\nTherefore, the number of layers is 8.\n\nWait, so that would mean that E_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_8, right?\n\nWait, because after 8 layers, the expression is 3*(E_8).\n\nWait, so then the total expression is 3*E_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E_9 was 29524, but maybe I was wrong because the number of layers is 8.\n\nWait, this is where I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, if there are 8 layers after the initial 3, then the total expression is 3*E_8, where E_8 = 9841.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier calculation, I went up to E_9 = 29524, which would make the total expression 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut now, I'm confused because I'm not sure whether the number of layers is 8 or 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it's (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer.\n\nThis continues until the innermost, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have an opening parenthesis, so let's count them.\n\nAfter the first 3, the first ( is at position 1: (1 + 3(...)).\n\nThen, inside that, another ( at position 3: (1 + 3(...)).\n\nContinuing, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, which is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting after the first 3:\n\n1.

(1 + 3(...\n\nAnd then the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, total layers are 8.\n\nTherefore, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E_9 was 29524, but that was based on 9 layers. Now, I'm seeing that it's 8 layers, so the total expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because when I computed E_9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572, but now I'm thinking that perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out the entire expression step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, after 8 layers, we have 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, but that seems incorrect because the original expression only has 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of times \"3(\" appears after the first 3 is 8, as I counted earlier.\n\nTherefore, the layers are 8, so the total expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, which would be 3*29524 = 88572, but that's because I added an extra layer.\n\nTherefore, the correct total is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by computing the expression step by step.\n\nLet me write the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nSo, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n9841 * 3.\n\nCompute 9000*3 = 27000.\n\n800*3 = 2400.\n\n40*3 = 120.\n\n1*3 = 3.\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400.\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520.\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572, but that was because I miscounted the layers as 9 instead of 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by substituting the layers step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute the expression from the innermost outwards.\n\nCompute the innermost part first:\n\nStart with 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think earlier I added an extra layer by mistake, thinking there were 9 layers instead of 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost expression and work our way outwards.

Let me write it down again to make sure I have it right:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each step is 1 + 3*(next inner expression). Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each level is 3*(1 + something). So maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me number each layer from the inside out. Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to write down each step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write each step as starting from the innermost and moving outwards, computing each step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4). Because each layer is 1 + 3*(inner expression).\n\nWait, so let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each step as:\n\nLet\u2019s say the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the first 3(, there's a 1 + 3(...). So starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. The initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each 3 inside is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each 3 inside adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each 3 as a new level. So starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each time we go out, we add another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write each step as a function. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4, since the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that might be a good approach. So, if I define f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4, then f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5=15, f(3)=3*(1 + 15)=3*16=48, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count how many times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 1 layer.\n- Then, moving out, each 3(1 + ...) adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 inside adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer.\n- Then inside that, another 3(...), so that's two layers.\n- Continuing, I think there are 9 layers in total, but I'm not sure. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times 3(1 + 3 occurs. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the initial 3, there's a 3(1 + 3(...)), so each of those is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, so that's 8 layers? Because after the initial 3, there are 8 more 3s. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps each time we have a 3(1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is 8? Or maybe 9?\n\nWait, perhaps I should just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and see how many steps I need to take.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 8 layers after the initial 3. So, the expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each step clearly.\n\nLet me define each step as f(n), where n is the number of layers from the innermost.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to just compute each step one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 8 layers after the innermost. So the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed a layer because the original expression has 9 layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the initial 3, there's a 3(1 + ...), so how many 3s are there after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, each layer from 9 down to 1, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 9: 4, then layer 8:13, layer7:40, layer6:121, layer5:364, layer4:1093, layer3:3280, layer2:9841, layer1:29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that each step is correct.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as f(n), then f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). With f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to solve it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, we can write the first few terms and see a pattern.\n\nf(1) = 4.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*f(9), where f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, 3*f(9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049, so 3^11 = 177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, I'll verify the steps again.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*f(9) = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost outwards:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost expression:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of layers. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). Maybe I can work from the inside out, peeling off each layer step by step. Let me try to break it down.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me compute that: 3 * 4 is 12.\n\nWait, but hold on, each layer is 3 times (1 + something). So, the next layer out would be 3 times (1 + 12). Let me check: 1 + 12 is 13, and then 3 * 13 is 39.\n\nHmm, okay, so each time I go out a layer, I'm adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. Let me see if I can find a pattern or maybe a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step because there are nine layers in total, which could take a while.\n\nBut maybe I should just compute each layer step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13; then 3 * 13 = 39\n4. Next: 1 + 39 = 40; then 3 * 40 = 120\n5. Next: 1 + 120 = 121; then 3 * 121 = 363\n6. Next: 1 + 363 = 364; then 3 * 364 = 1092\n7. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093; then 3 * 1093 = 3279\n8. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280; then 3 * 3280 = 9840\n9. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841; then 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so after each layer, the value is increasing significantly. Let me verify each step carefully because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13; multiply by 3: 13 * 3 = 39\n4. Next: 1 + 39 = 40; 40 * 3 = 120\n5. Next: 1 + 120 = 121; 121 * 3 = 363\n6. Next: 1 + 363 = 364; 364 * 3 = 1092\n7. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093; 1093 * 3 = 3279\n8. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280; 3280 * 3 = 9840\n9. Finally: 1 + 9840 = 9841; 9841 * 3 = 29523\n\nHmm, that seems consistent each time. Each step adds 1 to the previous result and then multiplies by 3. So, each step is kind of a geometric progression, but with an added 1 each time before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to model this. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a\u2081 = 3(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12, but wait, no. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13, then 3*13 = 39, etc. So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a\u2080 = 1. Then each subsequent term is a\u2099 = 3*(1 + a\u2099\u208b\u2081). So, starting from a\u2080, we compute a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers after the initial 1.\n\nWait, let me check: the original expression has nine 3s after the initial 3, so maybe it's eight layers? Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, there are nine layers of 3(...). So, perhaps a\u2080 = 1, then a\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2080), a\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081), and so on up to a\u2089. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to 9 layers and got 29523. Let me see if this approach gives the same result.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 3*(1 + a\u2099\u208b\u2081), with a\u2080 = 1.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na\u2080 = 1\n\na\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2080) = 3*(1 + 1) = 3*2 = 6\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, after the first innermost layer, I had 4, then 12. Hmm, perhaps my indexing is off. Maybe I need to adjust the initial term.\n\nWait, perhaps a\u2080 is the innermost expression. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on. Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then 3*(1 + 12) = 39, etc. So, maybe I'm not indexing correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start with a\u2080 = 1, then a\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2080) = 3*2 = 6, a\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 3*7 = 21, a\u2083 = 3*(1 + 21) = 3*22 = 66, a\u2084 = 3*(1 + 66) = 3*67 = 201, a\u2085 = 3*(1 + 201) = 3*202 = 606, a\u2086 = 3*(1 + 606) = 3*607 = 1821, a\u2087 = 3*(1 + 1821) = 3*1822 = 5466, a\u2088 = 3*(1 + 5466) = 3*5467 = 16401, a\u2089 = 3*(1 + 16401) = 3*16402 = 49206.\n\nWait, but that's different from my initial step-by-step where I ended up with 29523. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. There are nine 3s, each starting a new layer. So, that would mean nine layers, right? So, perhaps my initial step-by-step approach was correct, but my recurrence approach is not aligning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it as a\u2081 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, a\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, a\u2083 = 3*(1 + a\u2082) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120, and so on up to a\u2089.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\na\u2081 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\na\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\na\u2083 = 3*(1 + a\u2082) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\na\u2084 = 3*(1 + a\u2083) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\na\u2085 = 3*(1 + a\u2084) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\na\u2086 = 3*(1 + a\u2085) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\na\u2087 = 3*(1 + a\u2086) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\na\u2088 = 3*(1 + a\u2087) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\na\u2089 = 3*(1 + a\u2088) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but this is different from my initial step-by-step, where I stopped at a\u2088 = 29523. So, perhaps the problem is that I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, so there are nine layers after the initial 3. So, the total number of 3s after the initial one is nine, meaning that the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, in terms of the recurrence, we have a\u2081 through a\u2089, with a\u2081 being the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I only went up to a\u2088, so maybe I missed the last layer.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Multiply by 3: 3*4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13; 3*13 = 39\n4. Next: 1 + 39 = 40; 3*40 = 120\n5. Next: 1 + 120 = 121; 3*121 = 363\n6. Next: 1 + 363 = 364; 3*364 = 1092\n7. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093; 3*1093 = 3279\n8. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280; 3*3280 = 9840\n9. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841; 3*9841 = 29523\n10. Next: 1 + 29523 = 29524; 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so if I include all nine layers after the initial 3, I end up with 88572 as the final result. But in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at 29523 because I thought there were nine layers, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the initial expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and the number of layers is eight, not nine. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each time, it's a new layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, that's nine \"3(\" instances after the first 3, which would mean that there are nine layers. So, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29523, but then when I tried the recurrence approach, I ended up with 88572. Hmm, so perhaps I misapplied the recurrence.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the indices. Let me try to model this correctly.\n\nLet me define a\u2080 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2080) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na\u2083 = 3*(1 + a\u2082) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na\u2084 = 3*(1 + a\u2083) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na\u2085 = 3*(1 + a\u2084) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na\u2086 = 3*(1 + a\u2085) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na\u2087 = 3*(1 + a\u2086) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na\u2088 = 3*(1 + a\u2087) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\na\u2089 = 3*(1 + a\u2088) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, that's different again. Hmm, so I'm getting conflicting results based on how I index the layers. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem using the concept of a geometric series or some kind of expansion.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the expression step by step, carefully, without trying to find a formula yet.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\n10. Finally: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but the original expression only has nine layers after the initial 3. So, perhaps the initial 3 is the outermost layer, and then each \"3(...)\" is a layer, so nine layers in total.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 108255, but earlier I had 29523 and 88572. I'm confused now. Maybe I need to count the number of layers again.\n\nWait, let me visualize the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, nine layers after the initial 3, meaning that the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)) where the innermost is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, in terms of the step-by-step, I should have nine layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*4 = 12\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13; 3*13 = 39\n\n4. 1 + 39 = 40; 3*40 = 120\n\n5. 1 + 120 = 121; 3*121 = 363\n\n6. 1 + 363 = 364; 3*364 = 1092\n\n7. 1 + 1092 = 1093; 3*1093 = 3279\n\n8. 1 + 3279 = 3280; 3*3280 = 9840\n\n9. 1 + 9840 = 9841; 3*9841 = 29523\n\nSo, nine layers after the initial 3, giving 29523 as the result. But when I tried the recurrence approach, I ended up with 108255, which is way higher. So, I must be making a mistake in the recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial definition of a\u2080 is incorrect. Let me try to define a\u2080 as the value inside the first 3, so:\n\na\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2080) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na\u2083 = 3*(1 + a\u2082) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na\u2084 = 3*(1 + a\u2083) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na\u2085 = 3*(1 + a\u2084) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na\u2086 = 3*(1 + a\u2085) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na\u2087 = 3*(1 + a\u2086) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na\u2088 = 3*(1 + a\u2087) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\na\u2089 = 3*(1 + a\u2088) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, but that's nine layers after a\u2080, which would correspond to the nine layers in the problem. So, according to this, the total expression is 108255. But in my initial step-by-step, I got 29523. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers in the initial step-by-step. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n10. 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, so if I count from the innermost as step 1, then the outermost layer is step 10, which would be the result. But the problem only has nine layers after the initial 3, so maybe I'm including an extra step.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3 is the outermost, so the expression is 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is the ninth layer. So, in that case, the result would be the ninth term in the sequence, which is 36084. But in my initial step-by-step, I had 29523 as the ninth layer. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a multiplication by 3 and addition of 3, but let's see.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me try to represent the entire expression as a sum. Each layer adds a term that is 3 raised to a certain power. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me try to express the entire expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nThere are nine 3s after the initial 3, so nine layers. Let me try to expand this.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer contributes a term of 3^n, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me consider that each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, if I denote the innermost as a\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is a\u2099 = 3*(1 + a\u2099\u208b\u2081). So, with a\u2080 = 4, a\u2081 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a\u2082 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on up to a\u2088, since we have nine layers (a\u2080 to a\u2088). Wait, that would make sense if we have nine layers, starting from a\u2080 as the innermost.\n\nWait, so:\n\na\u2080 = 4\n\na\u2081 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na\u2082 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na\u2083 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na\u2084 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na\u2085 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na\u2086 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na\u2087 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na\u2088 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after nine layers, the value is 36084. Therefore, the total expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 29523 as the ninth layer. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I counted the layers. Let me check:\n\nIf the innermost layer is a\u2080 = 4, then the next layer is a\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2080) = 15, which is the second layer. Then a\u2082 = 48, third layer, and so on until a\u2088, which is the ninth layer. So, the total expression is a\u2088 = 36084.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I started with 1 + 3 = 4 as the first step, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, which I considered as the first layer. Then 1 + 12 = 13, multiplied by 3 to get 39 as the second layer, and so on. So, in that case, after nine layers, I would have:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 12\n\nLayer 3: 39\n\nLayer 4: 120\n\nLayer 5: 363\n\nLayer 6: 1092\n\nLayer 7: 3279\n\nLayer 8: 9840\n\nLayer 9: 29523\n\nSo, in this case, the ninth layer is 29523. But in the other approach, using a\u2080 to a\u2088, I got 36084.\n\nHmm, so which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I should write out the expression step by step, layer by layer, to see where the confusion is.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, Layer 9 is 36084. Therefore, the total expression is 36084.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I had Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 12, etc., which seems to be a different starting point. So, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3 is considered part of Layer 1 or not.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, in terms of layers, the outermost is Layer 1, and the innermost is Layer 9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think: the innermost is the deepest nested part, so it's Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I had Layer 1 as innermost, which might be causing confusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should define Layer 1 as the outermost 3*(1 + ...), and Layer 9 as the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + Layer 2)\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 3)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, starting from Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, in this case, the total expression is 36084.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nStarting from innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after nine layers, I end up with 36084. Therefore, the total expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had a different result because I considered the first multiplication by 3 as Layer 1, but perhaps that was incorrect. So, the correct approach is to recognize that each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1, starting from the innermost 1 + 3 = 4, and building up nine layers from there, resulting in 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nBut wait, I'm still confused because earlier I thought the answer was 29523. Maybe I should check with a smaller example to see where I went wrong.\n\nLet me take a smaller version of the problem with fewer layers to see which approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). According to the problem structure, this should have three layers after the initial 3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nSo, the result is 48.\n\nNow, using the recurrence approach:\n\na\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2080) = 15\n\na\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 48\n\nSo, yes, it works. Therefore, for three layers after the initial 3, the result is 48.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem, there are nine layers after the initial 3, so the result should be a\u2088 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial step-by-step approach was incorrect because I didn't correctly count the number of layers. The correct answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my first step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 12\n\nWait, that's different from the correct approach where the second layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. In my initial step-by-step, I mistakenly thought that the first layer after the innermost is 3*(1 + 4) = 12, but actually, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. So, I must have made a mistake in that step.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the initial step where I thought 3*(1"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I'm supposed to compute it step by step. Let me try to understand it first. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It seems like it's a chain of multiplications and additions. Let me see if I can break it down.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused. So, let's start by identifying the innermost part.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so that innermost part is 4. Now, let's move one level out. The next part is 3 times that result. So, the next expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), but since we just computed the innermost, it's 3(4). Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not skipping anything.\n\nWait, actually, each level is 1 + 3 times the next level. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next level is 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we get to the outermost level.\n\nSo, maybe I should write each step as a separate computation, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to write down each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, let me count the levels to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level, and there are 9 such levels. So, I think I did 9 levels, from Level 1 to Level 9. So, the outermost level is 3 times Level 9 result.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the outermost expression is 3*(...), where ... is the Level 9 result. So, after computing Level 9, which is 29524, the outermost operation is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, each level adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, I think I correctly went through 9 levels, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the final result after Level 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524).\n\nWait, but hold on, in my initial computation, I stopped at Level 9, which is 29524, but that is the result inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, I need to compute that.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, but that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*       3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify my steps again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many levels.\n\nLet me list out each level again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check each multiplication step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLevel 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nLet me denote the nth level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the outermost 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, this seems to confirm that the result is correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10} again to be absolutely sure.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing one more level manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's compute a_3 using the formula.\n\na_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression**: Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Compute each subsequent level**:\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by the final level result**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I'm supposed to compute the value step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me try to break it down. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions, right?\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so now I can replace that innermost part with 4. So the next layer out is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. The innermost was (1 + 3), which is 4. Then moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*(previous result)). Hmm, maybe I need to write this step by step.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the inside out. Let's see, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So each layer is a (1 + 3(...)) expression, starting from the innermost one.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each innermost expression as E1, then moving outward as E2, E3, up to E9, and then the outermost 3*(E9).\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until E9, and then the total expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So I can compute each E step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCompute E1 to E9 step by step.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the total expression is 3*E9, so:\n\nTotal = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations step by step because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me recast it:\n\nCompute E1 to E9:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each step again to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, but given the time, I might stick with the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, another thought: Each Ei can be represented as Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1), with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula, but perhaps it's overcomplicating for now. Alternatively, maybe I can see if each Ei is following a geometric progression or something.\n\nWait, let me check the values again:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 13\n\nE3 = 40\n\nE4 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE6 = 1093\n\nE7 = 3280\n\nE8 = 9841\n\nE9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, but wait, no, it's 3 times the previous term plus 1, but starting from 4.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nYes, so each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ei = A*3^i + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is Ei = 3*E(i-1) + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the recurrence is Ei = 3*E(i-1) + 1, but starting at E1 = 4. So, let's model it as Ei = 3*E(i-1) + 1, for i >= 2.\n\nTo solve this, the homogeneous solution is Ei^h = C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ei^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ei = C*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is Ei = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, Ei = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for E1.\n\nE1 = (3^{1+1} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, Ei = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes when computing 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each step, the final value is 88572.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*previous_result).\n\n3. Calculated each Ei up to E9, using both step-by-step computation and then verified with a closed-form formula from the recurrence relation.\n\n4. Then multiplied E9 by 3 to get the final result.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost expression:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous step:\n   \\[\n   E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   E_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot E_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

So each layer is correct up to Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572, which matches.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-A = 1\n\nThus, A = -1.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1) => 4 = 3C -1 => 3C = 5 => C = 5/3.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is L_n = (5/3)*3^n - 1 = 5*3^{n-1} - 1.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nAt n=1: L_1 = 5*3^{0} -1 = 5*1 -1 = 4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2: L_2 = 5*3^{1} -1 = 15 -1 =14. Wait, but earlier I computed L_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps my particular solution assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the particular solution. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAssuming a particular solution of the form A, a constant:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nWhich gives A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the previous calculation.\n\nWait, let me go through it again.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant A, so:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's a new layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...) in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which itself is followed by another (1 + 3(...)), etc.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because I started counting layers from the innermost, but maybe I should count how many times we have 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29,524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers? Because from the innermost to the outermost, each step adds a layer. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as a sequence of operations where each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, then 13, then 40, etc., up to 9 layers, and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, no, actually, each time we have 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), and each time we add a layer of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as a loop, where each iteration is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define a variable, say, current_value, starting with 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each step, current_value = 1 + 3*current_value.\n\nLet me do that 8 more times because the innermost is step 1, and then each layer adds another step.\n\nWait, so:\n\nStep 1: current_value = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: current_value = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nStep 3: current_value = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nStep 4: current_value = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nStep 5: current_value = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nStep 6: current_value = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: current_value = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: current_value = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: current_value = 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 steps of 1 + 3*current_value, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(...).\n\nSo, perhaps the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is 9, meaning that after 9 steps, we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I did 9 steps of 1 + 3*current_value, starting from 4, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check: if I have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), then the outermost is 3*(...). So, that would mean that after 9 steps, we have the innermost as 4, and each step adds another layer, so after 9 steps, we have the value before the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the count is off by one.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 1 + 3*(...) layers is 9, meaning that after 9 steps, we have the value that is inside the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, starting from (1 + 3) as the innermost, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we add another 3*(1 + ...), so the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is layer 2.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), which would correspond to 9 steps, each time computing 1 + 3*previous_value.\n\nSo, perhaps I'm correct with 9 steps, each time computing 1 + 3*previous_value, starting from 4, and then the final step is 3*result.\n\nWait, let me list out each step again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524.\n\nThen, Layer 10: 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, but the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 10.\n\nBut in the original expression, how many 3*(...) are there? Let me count the number of 3*(...) in the expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(...), so:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after a 3 indicates a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a new 3*(...), so how many times does 3*(...) occur?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(...) in the expression:\n\n1. The first 3*(...).\n\nThen, inside that, another 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many 3*(...) are there?\n\nEach time, after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis, so let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a ( after the 3, except for the innermost one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which itself has another ( after the 3.\n\nSo, each time, except the innermost, there's a ( after the 3.\n\nSo, let me count the number of times 3( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time after a 3, there's a (, except for the innermost one.\n\nSo, how many times does 3( occur?\n\nLet me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, so up to 9 times 3( occurs, but the innermost one is just 3, without a (.\n\nWait, so that suggests that there are 9 layers of 3*(...), each time except the innermost.\n\nWait, that might mean that I have 9 layers of 3*(...), each time computing 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is just (1 + 3).\n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier approach is correct with 9 layers, and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should just compute each step carefully.\n\nLet me try again, writing each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's 10 steps, with the first step being the innermost (1 + 3), and the 10th step being the multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of layers was 9, but perhaps it's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then one more multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as having 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, regardless, my step-by-step computation leads me to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check with a different approach, perhaps using a formula for such expressions.\n\nWait, this seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me consider the general form: Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let me compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the result is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found as follows.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nWait, let me solve the recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say, a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems solid. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each step using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19,683-1=19,682/2=9,841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59,049-1=59,048/2=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, that's consistent with each step.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the computations now.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to parse it step by step. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. It looks like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There's one at the very beginning, but then each layer adds another. Wait, actually, let me see:\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3, then that's inside another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the outermost 3(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each time adding another layer. So the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 around it, up to 9 layers. So the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the 9th layer. So, let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, the final value is 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3(...)), so yes, after computing L9, which is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but when I computed L9, I think I may have made a mistake. Let me go through each step again, more carefully.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nWait, 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let me compute that.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400.\n\n40 * 3 = 120.\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\nAdding them together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nThen L9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nSo the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29,524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29,524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. As before, 9841*3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(29,524). As before, 29,524*3=88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3...))) and so on. So when I compute L9, that's the innermost 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3(...). So maybe I'm correct.\n\nBut let me think again: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524.\n\nThen the outermost 3*(L9)=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then the first (1 + 3(...)), so each time we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLet me write the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer is 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that is another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 9 layers in total? Wait, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which would be the outermost 3(...). So yes, 9 layers. So L9 is 29,524, and then the total is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me try to see how many times I have \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" after the first is a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs:\n\n1. The first 3(1 + 3(...)) is the outermost.\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), so that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing, each time we have another 1 + 3(...), so up to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances, it's 9 times. So L1 to L9, each time adding a new layer. So yes, 9 layers, so L9 is 29,524, and the total is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the first 3.\n\n1. 3( starts the first layer.\n2. Then inside, another ( starts the second layer.\n3. Continuing, each ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" in the expression:\n\nThe expression after 3 is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"(\" after 3 is the first layer.\n\nThen inside, each \"1 + 3(\" introduces another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first \"(\" after 3: layer 1.\n- Then inside that, another \"(\" after 3: layer 2.\n- Continuing, each time, so how many \"(\" are there?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", then each \"3(\" introduces another \"(\". Let me count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. After the first 3, the first \"(\" is layer 1.\n2. Then inside, another \"(\" after 3: layer 2.\n3. Inside that, another \"(\" after 3: layer 3.\n4. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is after a \"(\", so that would be layer 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of \"(\" in the expression after the initial 3.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"(\" after the initial 3 is 9. Because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new \"(\", and the innermost is 1 + 3, which is after a \"(\", so total 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial calculation is correct: L9 = 29,524, and total expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I computed L9, I didn't make a mistake. Let me recompute L9.\n\nStarting from L8=9841.\n\nL9=1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400.\n\n40 * 3 = 120.\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\nAdd them up:\n\n27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400.\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520.\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nThen L9=1 + 29,523=29,524.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThen 3*29,524.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdd them:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, L9=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the total expression using the formula for L_n.\n\nSince the entire expression is 3*L9, and L9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\).

The problem is to compute:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that each start with 1 plus another 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That seems like a logical approach because each part depends on the result of the inner one.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The expression has multiple layers, each of which is 1 + 3 times something. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times the next expression. Hmm, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on, until there are nine layers. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of 3(...) parts. Let me parse it:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost)\n- Then another layer: 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n- And this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3(...). Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3 multiplied by an expression. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Then (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers? Wait, let me count the number of 3(...). Hmm, maybe it's eight layers because each 3(...) is a layer. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to start evaluating from the inside.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step. Maybe I'll write down each step as I go.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards, each layer is 1 + 3*(result from the inner layer). Let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me list the layers as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, but actually, the problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(...) parts. From the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). So the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is (1 + 3*(layer1)). Layer 3 is (1 + 3*(layer2)), and so on until layer 8, because the outermost is 3*(layer8). Wait, maybe I should check the number of 3*(...) expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which is 3 multiplied by a sum of 1 and 3 times another expression, and that continues until the innermost is (1 + 3). Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts.\n\nWait, each time you have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, each step adds another 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So after computing Layer9, which is 29524, that's the argument inside the outermost 3*(...). So the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check: the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So after computing Layer9 as 29524, then 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. So starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) expressions.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each 3*(...) is a layer, and there are 8 such layers after the initial 3*. Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then each time we go outward, we have another 3*(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous one. Let me try again.\n\nLet me parse the expression step by step, from the inside out.\n\nStart with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524\n\nNow, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, maybe a better way is:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n3 * 5 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLet me go back and compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check one more time with another approach, maybe using a formula.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Wait, because starting from layer1 as (1+3), and then each layer adds another 3*(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nWait, in the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So for layer9, n=9.\n\nSo a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo that's the result.\n\nWait, but I think I miscounted the number of layers earlier. Because in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, (1 + 3), that's layer1.\n\nThen each 1 + 3*(...) is a layer, so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) parts.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1 + 3*(...) is a layer.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each 1 + 3*(...) is another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is layer1: (1 + 3)\n- Then, the next is layer2: (1 + 3*(layer1))\n- Then layer3: (1 + 3*(layer2))\n- And so on, until layer9: (1 + 3*(layer8))\n\nSo yes, there are 9 layers in total. Thus, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just confirm by computing each layer again using the formula.\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and verified with a formula, I think it's solid.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward step by step.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Moving outward, each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 1} & : 1 + 3 = 4 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 2} & : 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3} & : 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4} & : 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5} & : 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6} & : 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7} & : 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8} & : 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9} & : 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The outermost expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{(result from Layer 9)}\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " It's a bit of a nested expression with a lot of parentheses, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these kinds of problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay. So, it's a series of 3s and 1s with a lot of parentheses. It looks like each layer is a 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so innermost first.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I see a 1+3(...), so I think there are nine layers here because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, and I can see nine sets of them. Let me check again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's eight layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times I see a 1+3(...). Let me count from the end.\n\nStarting from the very end, after the last 1+3, there are eight closing parentheses before the outermost 3(...). Hmm, maybe that's nine layers? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a function. Let's say each inner expression is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then moving outwards.\n\nLet me write each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Maybe that will help me keep track.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. Wait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, each time, a new layer is added. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but looking at the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(...), the first inner expression is 1+3(...), which then has another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses, right? Wait, no. Let me count each opening parenthesis:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo, the first opening parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another opening parenthesis. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see: starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1+3, so the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, since I think there are nine layers.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me check the original problem again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), so how many times does that happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. So, let's start.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me check: the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. I think I went up to Layer 9, but maybe I miscalculated somewhere.\n\nWait, let's go step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes I might make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, 30000*3=90000, 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, how many times does the 1+3(...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...).\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). Let me count:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses, right? Because each time we have a new (1+3(...). So, that would mean nine layers.\n\nWait, but in my calculation above, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check my calculations for each layer again, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression, which is Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nWait, that seems odd because all the terms in the problem are positive, so getting a negative particular solution might not make sense, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nThen, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nWait, so the formula approach gives me the same result as the step-by-step calculation, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it another way, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute each layer using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and then compute 3*a_9.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} and then compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nBut that's essentially the same as what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence, but perhaps it's a geometric series when expanded.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nWait, so each layer adds another term which is 3^{n} where n is the layer number.\n\nWait, so for Layer n, the expression is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, which is a geometric series with 9 terms.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{9} -1)/2? Wait, no, because earlier we had a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, when n=1, a_1=4=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4, correct.\n\nWhen n=2, a_2=13=(3^{3} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13, correct.\n\nSo, in general, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't miscount the number of layers. If the original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))...\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, the outermost layer is the ninth one, which is a_9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nwe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me see how many layers there are here.\n\nStarting from the inside, I can count the number of opening parentheses to figure out how deep the nesting goes. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine sets of parentheses. That means I need to compute from the innermost one, which is the ninth one, and then each subsequent layer.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.

Substituting 13 in, we get:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nSo, layer 7 is 40.\n\nMoving on to layer 6: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7). Plugging in 40:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 6 result: 121.\n\nNow, layer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6). Substituting 121:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is... let's see, 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nLayer 5: 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 5). So, 364:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 4 result: 1093.\n\nMoving to layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4). So, 1093:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nLayer 3: 3280.\n\nNow, layer 2: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3). Substituting 3280:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: Let me compute that. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nLayer 2: 9841.\n\nFinally, layer 1: 3*(result from layer 2). So, 9841:\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing layer 2, which was the innermost, we have to go back to the outermost layer, which is 3*(result from layer 2). Wait, no, actually, the layers are structured as follows:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, when I computed layer 9, then layer 8, ..., up to layer 1, which is 1 + 3*(layer 2). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 1). Wait, no, let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is layer 1.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer 1) is layer 2.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer 2) is layer 3.\n\nAnd so on, up to layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, that might be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I misnumbered the layers earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices to see:\n\nLet me denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, and then the outermost is 3*(E9).\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\n...\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, that makes more sense. So, I need to compute E1 through E9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, that might be a better approach.\n\nSo, let me try that.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting with E1: 1+3=4. That's correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1+12=13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1+39=40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1+120=121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1+363=364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524*3:\n\nBreaking down 29524:\n\n20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to see if I get the same result.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, E_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWhich can be written as E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have E_9, let's compute that.\n\nE_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is similar to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nSince we have E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived, which is indeed a geometric series sum formula.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start computing from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, substituting the result from the previous layer.\n\n3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3 as per the outermost operation.\n\n4. Alternatively, model the problem using a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to confirm the result.\n\nBoth approaches led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_9 \\) where each \\( E_i \\) is computed as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. It looks like each part is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify this step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That seems like a good strategy because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me write this down so I can visualize it better. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost expression:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(first layer). Let me write that down.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, that's 13. Moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's 40. Let's go another layer out.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that's 121. That's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWow, 364. That's a jump. Next layer:\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWhoa, that's 1093. Continuing on.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3280. Next layer.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThat's 9841. Next.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so the ninth layer gives me 29524. Now, since the original expression has nine layers, starting from the innermost, I think that's the final result inside the parentheses. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, I need to multiply this by 3.\n\nTenth layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 times 3. Let's do it step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 times 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way to be sure. Maybe I can break it down differently.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 87,572? Wait, that doesn't match my previous result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nWait, no, let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, but when I added up the parts earlier, I got 88,572 as well. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I had 87,572, but actually, it's 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nLet me check once more with another method. Maybe using distributive property.\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3s inside the parentheses, each 3 is part of a multiplication. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, each layer is a multiplication by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the parentheses, and then multiplied by 3. So, my initial calculation was correct, 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, you can model them as a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can check my result using another approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, that's a recursive relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I also arrive at 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^10 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is similar to a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.\n\nWait, but I think I've already used that approach with the recurrence relation, so maybe I don't need to go into that again.\n\nAnother way to check is to compute the expression step by step using smaller numbers and see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's compute a few layers manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to compute this. Maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nBut in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so it's not exactly a simple geometric series, but it's a linear recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nBut perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found a closed-form solution, maybe that's the best approach.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing a few more layers manually to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 is the value of the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer starting from the innermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\).\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " It's a bit of a nested expression, right? Let me see. The problem is to compute:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of parentheses. It looks like each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count: 1+3, then another 1+3, and so on. How many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after each opening parenthesis, there's a 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, the first is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, until we get to the outermost layer which is multiplied by 3.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost expression and then work my way outwards.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me label each step as Step 1, Step 2, etc., moving from the inside out.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so Step 1 gives me 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo Step 2 gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So that's 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo Step 3 gives me 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 3). So 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120.\n\n1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 4: 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121).\n\n3*121 = 363.\n\n1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 5: 364.\n\nMoving outward again: 1 + 3*(364).\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092.\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 6: 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093).\n\n3*1093: Hmm, 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279.\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 7: 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280).\n\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 8: 9841.\n\nMoving outward again: 1 + 3*(9841).\n\n3*9841: Let me break this down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523.\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 9: 29524.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(29524).\n\n3*29524: Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\n1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nStep 10: 88573.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(result from Step 10), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression.\n\nSo, 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9.\n\nAdding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719.\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n3 * 8 = 24, write down 4 and carry over 2.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n3 * 7 = 21, plus 1 is 22, write down 2 and carry over 2.\n\n3 * 8 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6 and carry over 2.\n\n3 * 3 = 9, plus 2 is 11, write down 11.\n\nSo, writing it down from the units place:\n\n- Units place: 3*3=9\n- Tens place: 3*7=21, carryover 2, so 1\n- Hundreds place: 3*5=15 +2=17, carryover 1, so 7\n- Thousands place: 3*8=24 +1=25, carryover 2, so 5\n- Ten-thousands place: 3*8=24 +2=26, carryover 2, so 6\n- Hundred-thousands place: 3*0=0 +2=2\n\nWait, but 88573 is a 5-digit number, so let's make sure:\n\nWait, 88573 is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 3 (units).\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\n3*3 = 9 (units)\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2 (tens)\n3*5 = 15 +2 =17, write down 7, carryover 1 (hundreds)\n3*8 =24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2 (thousands)\n3*8 =24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2 (ten thousands)\nBut since there are no more digits, write down the 2.\n\nSo the result is 265719.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps. Because if I messed up one step, all the subsequent steps would be wrong.\n\nLet me go back through each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*88573 = 265719. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems like each step checks out. So I think the final answer is 265,719.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this expression in another way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, then the next term is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nBut how many terms are there? Let me see. The original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds one more, so up to 9 layers, meaning that a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 88573.\n\nWait, so the total number of layers is 9, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9.\n\nBut in our problem, after computing up to a_9 = 88573, we multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 3*a_9 = 265719.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and the solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1}) = A*3^{n}\n\n3*B = 3B\n\nSo, RHS = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Wait, but earlier, after step 9, I had 29524, and then step 10 was 88573, which would correspond to n=10.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see: the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is step 1, then each subsequent layer adds one, so the outermost expression is step 10.\n\nWait, so in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...), so the number of a_n terms is 9, from n=1 to n=9, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I used the formula, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got to a_10 = 88573, which would correspond to n=10. So perhaps I have an off-by-one error in the counting.\n\nWait, let's clarify: the innermost expression is 1 +3, which is a_1=4. Then each layer out adds another 1 +3*(previous a). So if the expression has 9 layers of 1 +3(...), then the outermost layer would be a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to step 10, which gave me 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=29524, which is what I got in step 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that's not matching with my step-by-step, because in step 10, I had 88573, which was 1 + 3*29524=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula gives a_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*a_9) = 3*(1 + 3*29524) = 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is correct. Then, the next term would be a_{10}=1 +3*a_9=1 +3*29524=88573, which is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_{10}=3*88573=265719.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 10, with a_1=4 up to a_{10}=88573, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1 +3*(...). So maybe the number of a_n terms is 9, starting from a_1=4, up to a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 +3*a_9)=3*(1 +3*29524)=3*(1 +88572)=3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is correct, but I just need to make sure that I'm applying it correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E_1 =1 +3.\n\nThen, E_2 =1 +3*E_1.\n\nE_3=1 +3*E_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9.\n\nSo, with E_1=4, E_2=13, E_3=40, E_4=121, E_5=364, E_6=1093, E_7=3280, E_8=9841, E_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I got to E_{10}=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 +3(...) inside. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first is 1 +3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 +3 appears:\n\n1. 1 +3\n2. 1 +3(...)\n3. 1 +3(...)\n4. 1 +3(...)\n5. 1 +3(...)\n6. 1 +3(...)\n7. 1 +3(...)\n8. 1 +3(...)\n9. 1 +3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1 +3(...). Therefore, the innermost is E_1=4, and the outermost is E_9=29524, as per the formula.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step earlier, I went up to E_{10}=88573, which would be 1 +3*E_9=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, E_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*E_9=88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let me check my step-by-step.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 10 steps, starting from E_1=4, up to E_{10}=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, E_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*E_9=88572.\n\nSo, clearly, there's a discrepancy here. I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the layers. Let me look at the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 +3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 +3\n2. 1 +3(1 +3)\n3. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))\n4. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))\n5. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))\n6. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))\n7. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))\n8. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))\n9. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))\n10. The entire expression is 3*(the 9th layer)\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is 1 +3, which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3(...), up to the 9th layer, which is the innermost part of the expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*(9th layer).\n\nWait, so that would mean that E_1=4, E_2=13, E_3=40, up to E_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*E_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to E_{10}=88573, which would correspond to E_{10}=1 +3*E_9=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, so perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the way I labeled the steps was incorrect. Let me try to structure it correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 +3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 +3*(previous result).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nLayer10:1 +3*29524=88573.\n\nWait, so now I'm seeing that there are 10 layers, with Layer10 being 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer10=3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, if n=10, a_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. Correct.\n\nSo, then, the entire expression is 3*a_{10}=3*88573=265719.\n\nBut according to the problem, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(...)) with 9 layers of 1 +3(...). So, perhaps the formula counts n=10 because it starts from the innermost as n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile this.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1 +3(...) expressions inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 +3\n2. 1 +3(1 +3)\n3. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))\n4. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))\n5. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))\n6. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))\n7. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))\n8. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))\n9. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))\n10. The entire expression is 3*(the 9th layer)\n\nWait, so perhaps the 9th layer is the innermost part of the expression, and then the entire expression is 3*(9th layer).\n\nWait, that would mean that the number of layers is 9, with E_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*E_9=88572.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I had 10 layers, ending with E_{10}=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the problem is written as 3*(1 +3*(...)), with 9 layers of 1 +3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 +3, which is the first layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3*(...), up to 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(the 9th layer).\n\nWait, so if there are 9 layers, then n=9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had 10 layers, ending with 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1 +3 appears as a sub-expression:\n\n1. 1 +3\n2. 1 +3(1 +3)\n3. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))\n4. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))\n5. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))\n6. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))\n7. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))\n8. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))\n9. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))\n10. 3*(the 9th layer)\n\nWait, so the expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1 +3*(layer8), and so on, down to layer1=1 +3.\n\nSo, in this case, the number of layers is 9, with layer9 being the innermost part of the expression.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which included the outermost 3*(...). Maybe that's where the confusion is.\n\nWait, perhaps the layers are the 1 +3*(...) parts, excluding the outermost 3*(...). So, if there are 9 layers of 1 +3*(...), then the innermost is layer1=1 +3, layer2=1 +3*(layer1), up to layer9=1 +3*(layer8), and then the entire expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nTherefore, the number of layers of 1 +3*(...) is 9, so n=9, and a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I included the outermost 3*(...) as a step, making it 10 layers, which might not be accurate.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again, more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*.\n\nAfter 3*, we have (1 +3*(...)), which is layer1.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 +3*(...)), which is layer2.\n\nContinuing, each opening parenthesis introduces a new layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3*(1 +3))\n3. (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))\n4. (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))\n5. (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))\n6. (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))\n7. (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))\n8. (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))\n9. (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of 1 +3*(...), so the innermost is layer1=1 +3=4, then layer2=1 +3*4=13, up to layer9=1 +3*(layer8)=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the number of layers is 9, each being 1 +3*(previous layer). Therefore, the formula gives a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which included the outermost 3*(...), leading to a result of 265719. But according to this, the correct result should be 88572.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by considering the outermost 3*(...) as an additional layer, whereas it's just a multiplication, not another layer of 1 +3*(...).\n\nLet me try to recompute step-by-step, this time correctly counting the layers as 9.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was considering the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, which it's not. It's just a multiplication, so the number of layers is 9, each being 1 +3*(...), starting from the innermost.\n\nTherefore, the correct result should be 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought that the number of layers was 9, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 10 layers, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should verify using the formula.\n\nAccording to the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIf n"

    "text": " It's a bit of a nested expression, and I'm a bit nervous because nested parentheses can get confusing. Let me see if I can break it down step by step.\n\nThe problem is: Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me try to parse this. It looks like there are multiple layers of parentheses, each containing a similar structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). But wait, the innermost part is already computed as 4, so the next layer would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute the next layer:\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nHmm, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit big. Let me double-check. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is indeed 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nNow, the next layer is (1 + 3*(40)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 121. That's a nice number, 11 squared. Interesting. Let me continue.\n\nNext layer is (1 + 3*(121)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(364)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's a prime number, I think. Not sure if that's relevant, but just noting.\n\nNext layer is (1 + 3*(1093)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's a big number, but okay.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(3280)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nHmm, 9840 plus 1 is 9841. I think that's 99 squared, but let me check: 99 times 99 is 9801, so no, that's not it. Maybe 99.2 or something? Not sure, maybe it's just a random number.\n\nNext layer is (1 + 3*(9841)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's a large number. Let me make sure I did that correctly. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(29524)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer:\n1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, 3 times 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. That's a prime number as well, I think. Not sure, but okay.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by that result. So, the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute the final layer:\n3*(88573) = ?\n\nLet me break this down. 88573 times 3. Let me compute each digit:\n\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3*5 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3*8 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3*8 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2\nBut wait, there are no more digits, so that carry over 2 becomes 2. So putting it all together, we get 265719.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 88573*3:\n\n- 3*3 = 9\n- 3*7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n- 3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n- 3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n- 3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n- No more digits, so write 2.\n\nSo the number is 265719. Let me check with another method. 88573 * 3:\n\nCompute 80000*3 = 240000\nCompute 8000*3 = 24000\nCompute 500*3 = 1500\nCompute 70*3 = 210\nCompute 3*3 = 9\nAdd them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 265719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps because this is a lot of layers. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nEach step seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So I think the final answer is 265719.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps using a different approach or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each step is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous result.\n\nLet me see if this forms a geometric series or something. Let me denote each step as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\na10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\na11 = 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265719\n\nSo, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, the sequence is correct. Now, is there a closed-form formula for this kind of recurrence relation?\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for a1, that would be (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is correct.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 10 layers of (1 + 3(...)), which would correspond to n=10. Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, the innermost is a1=4, then a2=13, up to a10=88573, and then the final step is 3*a10=265719.\n\nBut in the closed-form, a10 = (3^{11} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, a10 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, using the closed-form, I can compute it directly without going through each step. But since I already did the step-by-step and verified, I think I'm confident the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 265719.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Next layer:\n    \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\]\n\n11. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 88573 = 265719 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

    "text": " Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly. It says to compute this expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part is enclosed within parentheses, so I should handle the innermost one first.\n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So, the next layer is:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I have a 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous value). Let me list these layers step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, but the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of 3's to check.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so that's 9 layers, meaning I have to compute from the innermost (1+3) up to the ninth layer. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nLet me number each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 11.\n\nWait, but that's 29524 * 3.\n\nWait, let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did the layers correctly. Let me recount to make sure I didn't skip any layers or make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3 times that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is a layer, and each step adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\".\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something like that.\n\nLet me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, a_1 is 4, as we saw earlier.\n\nBut let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 =243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3 times a sum that's built up recursively, but I think the step-by-step approach is clearer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, so the expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But in this case, since each term is nested inside the previous one, it's a bit different. The formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation seems to fit.\n\nSo, just to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 =4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n3. Compute up to 9 layers.\n\n4. Multiply the 9th layer result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for the nth layer, compute a_9, then multiply by 3.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way out. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). \n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
