    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Setting a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B. Solving: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with our earlier computations: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can find a particular solution. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 a_2 = 13 = 9 + 4 a_3 = 40 = 27 + 13 a_4 = 121 = 81 + 40 a_5 = 364 = 243 + 121 a_6 = 1093 = 729 + 364 a_7 = 3280 = 2187 + 1093 a_8 = 9841 = 6561 + 3280 a_9 = 29524 = 19683 + 9841 Hmm, interesting. It seems that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the closed-form solution would be a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus some constant. Let me try to express a_n as a_n = (4*3^{n-1} - 1). Let's test this for n=1: (4*3^{0} - 1) = 4 - 1 = 3, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n} + 1). Let's test: n=1: 3 + 1 = 4, which matches. n=2: 9 + 1 = 10, but a_2 is 13. Doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe a_n = (3^{n} + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1) + 1? Wait, that would be a geometric series sum. Let's see, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^{n-1} = (3^n - 1)/2. So, if a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the solution is a_n = (3^{n} + 1)/2. Let's test this: For n=1, a_1 = (3 + 1)/2 = 2, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (4*3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's test n=1: (4*3 -1)/2 = (12 -1)/2 = 11/2 = 5.5, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Perfect! So the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving such a recurrence, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So let's see if we can find a closed-form formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, layer n has a value of (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just continued computing each layer step by step, which I did initially. But recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows me to find a direct formula, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3. Each layer's value can be computed step by step, and the final result is 3 times the value of the outermost layer, which is layer 9.

The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's similar to a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but let me check. Let me consider the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. Therefore, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but since we're nesting them, it's similar to a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. However, the recurrence approach seems to have worked well here. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value of 4, then built up each subsequent layer until the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the alternative method using the recurrence relation confirmed the result.

Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works.

Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms my earlier calculation.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set equal to left-hand side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also look at the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier computation.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads to the same result.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me try to find a particular solution. Let me assume that the steady-state solution is a constant, say a_n = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's negative, but our terms are positive and increasing. Alternatively, perhaps using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, which we found as C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer.

So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but wait, our a_1 is 4. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different. Let me compute a few terms using the recurrence and see if I can spot a pattern. a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 =1 +39=40 a4=1+3*a3=1+120=121 a5=1+3*a4=1+363=364 a6=1+3*a5=1+1092=1093 a7=1+3*a6=1+3279=3280 a8=1+3*a7=1+9840=9841 a9=1+3*a8=1+29523=29524 Now, let's see if these numbers match any known sequence or formula. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series. Let's consider that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} Similarly, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} * a_1. But a_1 is 4, so a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 4*3^{n-1}. Wait, let me check that. Wait, actually, when we expand a_n, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, after expanding n times, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} * a_1. But a_1 = 4, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 4*3^{n-1}. The sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k is (3^n -1)/2, because it's a geometric series with ratio 3. So, a_n = (3^n -1)/2 + 4*3^{n-1}. Let's compute this for n=9, which is our case. a_9 = (3^9 -1)/2 + 4*3^{8}. Let's compute 3^9 and 3^8. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, a_9 = (19683 -1)/2 + 4*6561 = (19682)/2 + 4*6561 = 9841 + 26244. Now, 9841 + 26244: 9841 + 26244. Let's add these numbers. 9841 + 26244: 9841 + 26244. Let's compute 9841 + 26244: 9841 + 26244 = 36085? Wait, wait, that doesn't match the earlier value of 29524. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula isn't correct. Let me check for n=1: a1=4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 + 4*3^{0} = (3-1)/2 + 4*1 = 1 + 4 =5. But a1 is 4, so that's not matching. So, my formula is incorrect. Maybe I need to adjust it. Let's think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's compute the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a3=40. Great, so the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^{10}=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, LHS = A*3^n + B, RHS = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.
