    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a general formula, which could help verify my step-by-step computation. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as we computed earlier. Similarly, n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, this method confirms the step-by-step computation.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.

So, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for a_n, which would be useful if the number of layers were larger, but here since it's only 9, computing each step is feasible. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Then substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 \u21d2 r = 3.

Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, in general, this recurrence can be solved as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=1: (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2 = 27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: 81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2 = 59049/2 - 0.5 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, that's correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and this is a linear recurrence that can be expressed as a geometric series.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.

Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer until reaching the ninth layer, then multiply by 3. Using the recurrence relation, we find that the ninth layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a0 + d*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, r=3, d=1. So, a_n = 3^{n} * a0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial term is a1=4, not a0. So perhaps the indexing is shifted. Let me adjust. If we set n=1: a1=4. Then, for n layers, the expression would be a_n = 3^{n} * a0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But since a1=4, which is 1 + 3*1, so a1 = 1 + 3*a0, where a0=1. So, a1=4, a2=1 + 3*4=13, etc. So, the general formula would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for the innermost layer, which is layer1, n=1, a1=4. The outermost layer is layer9, so n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so the outermost expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the answer. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n.

So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's consistent with what I computed earlier. Therefore, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, solving this recurrence relation: The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ), but wait, no. Wait, because each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 =81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in the original problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me verify 3^{10} is indeed 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute this again to be thorough. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's breaking it down incorrectly because 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which is (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}, and 3*(1/2)=3/2, so 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's another way to see it. So, the answer is 88572.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3 + B = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 a_2 = 13 = 9 + 4 a_3 = 40 = 27 + 13 a_4 = 121 = 81 + 40 Hmm, it seems that each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let's assume the particular solution is C. Then, plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me solve it using the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40, correct.

Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So that's consistent with our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms it. Alternatively, using the formula, the final result is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that also gives us 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.

    "text": " The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if it matches. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.

Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me find B by setting a_n = a_{n-1} = B, so B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Alternatively, if I had to compute this for more layers, using the formula would be much faster, but for 9 layers, step-by-step is manageable. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Then multiply that by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.

Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can find A using the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for the homogeneous solution, we can see that each term is 3 times the previous, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"
