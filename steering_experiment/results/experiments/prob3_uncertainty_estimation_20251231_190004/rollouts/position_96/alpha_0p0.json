    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation is correct, and using the recurrence relation formula also leads to the same result.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let me find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B So, left side: A*3^{n} + B = right side: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1 Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. But B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

The recurrence is linear and can be written as: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Plugging into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be absolutely sure, let me verify with smaller cases. Suppose I have a simpler version with fewer layers. Let's say compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this manually: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40=120. Now, using the formula: For n=3 layers inside, a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*a_3=120. Which matches. So the formula works here. Similarly, let's try n=2: 3(1 + 3(1 +3)). Innermost:1+3=4. Next layer:1 +3*4=13. Multiply by 3: 39. Using the formula: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. 3*a_2=39. Correct. So, the formula holds.

Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that for n=0, a_0 would be 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so if a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4). So, if we set n=0: a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 2) A + B = 1 (from n=0) Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: (3A + B) - (A + B) = 4 - 1 => 2A = 3 => A = 3/2.

Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.

Also, since the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, set a_n = B, then B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me try to find the steady-state solution. Let\u2019s assume that a_n = k for all n. Then, k = 1 + 3k => k - 3k = 1 => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting, but our initial terms are positive and increasing, so maybe the homogeneous solution isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers.

So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Also, let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into 3A + B = 4: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.

Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation, we can find a general formula. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.

That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, it's like building a number where each digit is 1, but in base 3? Wait, not exactly, but it's similar to a base conversion. Wait, let's see: Let's think of it as a number in base 3, where each digit is 1, but each position is multiplied by 3^n. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, if I write each step, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, each step is 3*previous + 3. Wait, no, it's 3*previous +1, because it's 1 + 3*something. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, if I think of it as starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Alternatively, the recurrence relation can be solved more formally. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.

Therefore, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. For n=0, perhaps? Wait, but n starts at 1. Alternatively, let's consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition at n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our expression has 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which can be represented as a geometric progression. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step isn't too bad. So, to recap, the process is: Start from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step, and then multiply the outermost result by 3. Each layer's value is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value at each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number. For layer 9, this gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives us the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
