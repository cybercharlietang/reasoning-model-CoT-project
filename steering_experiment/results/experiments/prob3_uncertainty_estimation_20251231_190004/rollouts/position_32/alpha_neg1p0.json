Let me check that: 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(29524) = 88572 Hmm, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, that's right. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, yes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, that's good.

So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just double-check the number of layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count wrong. Starting from the innermost, each time I added a layer, and I ended up with 9 layers, which corresponds to the 9 sets of parentheses. So, that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions because this looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a linear recurrence. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*b^{n} + c, where c is a constant. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result. That makes me confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but when I added up the parts earlier, I got 88572 as well. So, maybe that's correct. Let me just verify once more by another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nThis expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven that L_1 = 4, as we computed earlier, we can find A and B.\n\nWait, but let me check: For n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nSo, plugging into the general solution:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nBut we need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence:\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, substituting A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, we had layer 9 as 29524. Let me check if (3^{10} -1)/2 equals 29524.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as we computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can compute the result directly without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 layers, both methods worked fine. I think I'll stick with the step-by-step method for clarity, but it's good to know that there's a formula for future reference.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3, we arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a specific sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could represent this without computing each layer step by step. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This looks like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is the first layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using the formula. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049, so 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, each step checks out. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This seems similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is built upon the previous one. Let me try to model it mathematically. Let's denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can set up the equation by plugging L_n into the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Using the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Okay, so for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, using this formula, we can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Now, the total expression is 3 * L_9, so Total = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression would be 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: Let's break it down for easier calculation. 3 * 29524 = 3 * (29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Okay, that seems solid. But wait, let me think again. Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is generating a number that's part of a geometric progression or something similar. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form seems to be a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the result. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, and 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, so the formula we derived applies here. Since we have nine layers, n=9, so a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me recompute each layer to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct)\nTotal: 3*29524 = 88,572 (Correct)\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. Another way to think about this problem is to recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or a recursive formula. Let me see if I can model this with a formula to confirm the result. Let's denote the value at each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Starting from the innermost layer, which is layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The standard form for such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient and c is the constant term. In our case, r = 3 and c = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(r - 1)) * r^{n-1} - (c)/(r - 1). Let me plug in the values: a_1 = 4, r = 3, c = 1. So, a_n = (4 + (1)/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} - (1)/(3 - 1) = (4 + 0.5) * 3^{n-1} - 0.5 = 4.5 * 3^{n-1} - 0.5. Let's compute a_9 using this formula: a_9 = 4.5 * 3^{8} - 0.5. Since 3^8 is 6561, so 4.5 * 6561 = Let me compute that: 4 * 6561 = 26,244 and 0.5 * 6561 = 3,280.5, so total is 26,244 + 3,280.5 = 29,524.5. Then, subtract 0.5: 29,524.5 - 0.5 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result again. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3, so the sum can be represented as a geometric series with ratio 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. However, in this case, the series isn't exactly a simple geometric series because each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, which adds a constant each time. Maybe I can model it differently. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. As I did earlier, solving it using the standard method gives the same result. So, given that both step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result, I can be confident that the total is indeed 88,572. Let me just try computing one of the layers again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's pick Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*Layer5. Layer5 was 364, so 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each step checks out. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 88,572, but in my initial calculation, I wrote 88572. That's the same number, just without the comma. So, that's correct. Hmm, so I think I did that right.

So, I think the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, yes, nine layers, each computed correctly.

So, the total value is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me solve for D. Assume a particular solution D is a constant, so substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. Hmm, that seems a bit odd, but let's proceed. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4=C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Since each layer adds a power of 3, and we have 9 layers, but I think the formula I derived is sufficient. Let me just confirm that the number of layers is correct. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside the main 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, n=9. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the total is 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check my calculations once more to be sure. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me check once more to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost, each step seems correct. Each layer's computation follows logically. So, I think I did it right. The answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor Layer 1 (n=1): a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2 (n=2): a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3 (n=3): a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4 (n=4): a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5 (n=5): a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6 (n=6): a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7 (n=7): a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8 (n=8): a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9 (n=9): a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find the value of each a_n directly. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step computation. Just to ensure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27, carryover 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 2*3 = 6. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Either way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I think that's the correct computation. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but using the recurrence relation formula made it much easier. I didn't have to compute each layer manually, which saved time and reduced the chance of error. So, the key takeaway here is recognizing the pattern and using the appropriate mathematical tools, like recurrence relations, to simplify the problem.

Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations because that seems a bit high.

Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result. Maybe that's correct after all. But wait, let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps something that can be modeled recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for this problem, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. But let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute a_n directly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to double-check. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 *3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, each layer \\( a_n \\) can be computed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524.

Yep, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k and c are constants. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^5=243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243^2. 240^2 = 57,600. Then, (240 + 3)^2 = 240^2 + 2*240*3 + 3^2 = 57,600 + 1,440 + 9 = 57,600 + 1,440 = 59,040 + 9 = 59,049. So, 3^10 = 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something like that. Let me think. Since the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. Since 3^10=59,049, then 3^11=3*59,049=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result. So, another way to think about it is that the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2, which equals 88,572. That's a neat formula, but I guess since the problem is presented with all those layers, it's testing the ability to handle nested expressions step by step. So, in conclusion, whether I compute each layer manually or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, I'll recap: Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88,572. Yep, that all adds up. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n- 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. This looks familiar; it's similar to a geometric series but with an added constant. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a_(n-1). a_n = 1 + 3*a_(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_(n-1), which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Wait, but actually, let me clarify: in the problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have continued computing each layer step by step as I did initially, but recognizing the recurrence relation made it much faster, especially since there are nine layers. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations can simplify complex-looking problems. So, in summary, by either method, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But I'm a bit surprised because each layer seems to be growing exponentially. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as geometric series. Let me try to model this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier computation, a_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 was 1 + 3*4=13, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from 4.

Then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, we can think of each layer as building up a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression a bit more to see if I can see the pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n...\n\nWait, I see now. Each layer is actually 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... up to 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each layer. But actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous total). So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nBut since we've already derived a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we know that for n=9, it's 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again using the formula:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 (correct)\na_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 (correct)\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 (correct)\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121 (correct)\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364 (correct)\na_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093 (correct)\na_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280 (correct)\na_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841 (correct)\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524 (correct)\n\nYes, so each layer checks out with the formula. Therefore, the final computation is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we find the outermost layer's value and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait a minute, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct, but let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to confirm the result.

So, I think 88,572 is the right answer. I guess another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. I could also write a general formula for the nth layer, but since n is 9 here, step-by-step computation is manageable. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time. Each layer k is defined as Layer k = 1 + 3*(Layer k-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Let me plug k=1 into the general formula: Layer 1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Similarly, Layer 2 = 13. Plugging k=2: 3A*3^2 + B = 9A + B =13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B =4 and 9A + B=13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 =>6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2=1.5. Then, plugging back into 3A + B=4: 3*(1.5) + B=4 =>4.5 + B=4 =>B=4 -4.5= -0.5. So, the general formula would be Layer k = (3/2)*3^k - 0.5. Let me test this for k=1: (3/2)*3^1 -0.5= (3/2)*3 -0.5= 9/2 -1/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f For k=2: (3/2)*9 -0.5=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For k=3: (3/2)*27 -0.5=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For k=4: (3/2)*81 -0.5=243/2 -1/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, it works! So, Layer k = (3/2)*3^k - 0.5. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3/2)*3^9 - 0.5. Let's compute that: 3^9 is 19,683. So, (3/2)*19,683 = (3*19,683)/2. Let's compute 19,683*3: 19,683*3: 10,000*3=30,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 600*3=1,800; 80*3=240; 3*3=9. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 19,683*3: 3*3=9, 3*8=24 (write down 4, carryover 2), 3*6=18 +2=20 (write down 0, carryover 2), 3*8=24 +2=26 (write down 6, carryover 2), 3*9=27 +2=29 (write down 9, carryover 2), 3*1=3 +2=5. So, 19,683*3=59,049. Then, 59,049 /2 =29,524.5. Then, subtract 0.5: 29,524.5 -0.5=29,524. So, Layer 9=29,524. Which matches my earlier step-by-step calculation. Then, the total is 3*29,524=88,572. So, using the general formula also gives me the same result. That's reassuring. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each calculation was correct. 3. Verify using a general formula derived from the recurrence relation. 4. Confirm that both methods give the same result. So, yeah, that's how I solved it. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I didn't make any mistakes that I can see, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait a second, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add a layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses, each adding a layer. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check that because I might have miscounted the layers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers: Starting from the innermost, 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so each of those is a new layer. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3. So, my initial computation was correct, ending up with 88,572. Wait, but let me verify the calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation of 3*29524 again. Maybe I should do it more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems large, so maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3)\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, each adding a layer. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, the total is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I compute Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct because Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. Let's see:\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just noticed that the original expression has 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, I correctly accounted for all 9 layers. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", that's Layer 1: 1 + 3(...)\n\nThen each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, my computation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This seems like a geometric series, but it's not exactly because each term is built upon the previous one in a linear fashion. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121, and so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nThat's another way to look at it, using the formula directly.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. By solving the recurrence relation, we find that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2.

Maybe I should do it step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that because 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nWait a second, did I do all the layers correctly? Let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + r(a + r(a + ... )) can be solved using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this problem as such.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the general form is:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*L_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try to compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern.\n\nGiven:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, L_9 is 29524, and the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSubtract 3*L_p from both sides:\n\n-2*L_p = 1\n\nThus, L_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the outermost layer, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9. So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Hmm, so the total value is 88,572. Wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of parentheses. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time another 1+3(...) So, from the innermost to the outermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 1 is innermost, Layer 9 is outermost. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, up to a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recursive sequence can be found, maybe? Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think about the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. If I expand it, it's 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to eight layers, but that seems more complicated. Maybe the recursive approach is better here. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already solved that, it's probably the most straightforward way. So, I think my initial computation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), and inside that is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 0 = 3*a_{n-1}, so the characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches a_2. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, matches a_3. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That's much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's easy to make a mistake, so having a formula is helpful. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the total expression is 3*(sum of a geometric series). But in this case, the closed-form approach seems more straightforward. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was to compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine sets of parentheses. By expanding from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, leading to a recurrence relation. Solving that, we find each layer's value, and finally multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9, gives us the innermost value before multiplying by 3. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I don't see any errors in my reasoning.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's right. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but I'm a bit surprised by how large the numbers get. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find D. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} + D => 4 = 3C + D. Now, let's consider the homogeneous solution. Wait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, I can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. The innermost layer is computed first, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The relation is given by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with the initial term a\u2081 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution is found to be a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For n = 9 (the outermost layer), a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final result would be 3*(29524) = 88572 Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, that's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, that's correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time adding a layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(...))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). I think I correctly went through nine layers, each time computing the next one. So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it in general. The recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: 1 + 3 =4, which is a_1. Then each subsequent layer adds a new a_n. The outermost layer is a_9, because we have nine layers of 1+3(...). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think this is correct. Let me just check once more with the formula. Since a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, which is 29524, and then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, yeah, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, which I did earlier. So, each layer is correct, and the final result is 88572. Hmm, seems a bit large, but given that each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the numbers grow exponentially, so it's plausible. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only 9 layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive formula. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be represented as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but actually, it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, no, that's not exactly a geometric series. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which we solved earlier. So, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can compute it directly without iterating through each layer. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. That's much faster. But since I was able to compute it step by step earlier, and both methods agree, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up to 29524 at the ninth layer. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, and both methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer up to Layer 9, which I did, and arrived at the same result. So, either way, the answer is consistent. I don't think I made any calculation errors, as each step checks out, and the formula derived from the recurrence relation also gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
