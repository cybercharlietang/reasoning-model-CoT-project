    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) Hmm, okay, so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So that part becomes 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 3 times that result. So the next step is 3*(4) which is 12. Then, the next level out is 1 + 12, which is 13. So that part becomes 13. Then, moving out another level, we have 3*13, which is 39. Then, the next level is 1 + 39, which equals 40. Continuing this way, the next step is 3*40, which is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Next, 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Continuing, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Next, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Next, 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Finally, the outermost step is 3*9841, which is 29523. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me count the number of times I have to compute. Starting from the innermost, each time I compute a term, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, each step is 3*(previous result) + 1. So, let's list them step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, hold on, that's different from my initial calculation. I think I might have miscounted the number of times I applied the operations. Let me try again, more carefully, perhaps writing each step down.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Let's define each level as Level 1 to Level 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses inside each other.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), so:\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from my first attempt. So, I think I messed up the initial count, thinking that there were 9 levels, but when I first did it, I only went up to 9 steps, but perhaps I had an extra step. Let me verify.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(...)) where the ... is another 3(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening 3(1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of times we do this is how many? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have one more 3*(1 + ...). Let me write them out:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3)\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n3*(1 + 3) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, actually, each time, it's 3*(previous result) + 1. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of each step as 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next level is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until we reach the outermost level, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, how many levels do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the first 3, the first (1+3(...)) is level 1, then level 2, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many times does the (1 + 3*(...)) pattern occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, we have (1 + 3). Then, each level adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so let's count the number of these. Each opening (1 + 3*(...) corresponds to a level. So, the innermost is level 1: (1 + 3). Then level 2: (1 + 3*(level1)). Level3: (1 + 3*(level2)), etc.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1+3(...) is a new level. So, starting from the first 3, the first (1+3(...) is level1, then level2, up to level9, because I can see that there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of (1+3(...) is 9. Let me confirm by counting the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the 9th time.\n\nSo, that means there are 9 levels of (1 + 3*(...)), each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, we have 9 iterations of this process.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, let's compute each level step by step:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level9). So, we compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 29,523, but that was before multiplying by 3. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nLet me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. Level1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Level2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Level3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Level4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. Level5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. Level6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. Level7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. Level8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. Level9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nEach level is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 levels, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. After computing each level up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent level by substituting the previous result:\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))). Hmm, let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3 times the next expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, so that means the expression is nested nine times. Wait, actually, when I look at it, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so maybe it's actually eight layers deep because the innermost is just (1 + 3). Let me check that again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))). So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost), then the next is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times the pattern 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 3(...), then each step adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3's that are multiplying the parentheses. There's a 3 at the very beginning, then each subsequent layer has another 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's the ninth layer. Then each layer before that adds another 3*(...). So, maybe there are eight layers where each layer is 3*(previous expression). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's better to just start computing from the inside and work my way out. Let me try that approach. Let's define each layer step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost expression. Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), so that's L1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(L1), which would be L2. Then L3 is 1 + 3*(L2), and so on, until L9, which is the outermost expression. But actually, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). Wait, let me see: the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is (1 + 3*(L8)), and so on. So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer starting from L1 up to L9, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that. Let's start with L1, which is the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, L2 is the next layer: L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me keep going. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, it's growing quickly. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go back through each layer and verify the calculations.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, when I computed up to L9, which is (1 + 3*(L8)), and then multiplied by 3, that's correct because the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is to recognize that the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ), which simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nThis method is much faster and avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. But since I was able to compute it both ways and get the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer's value is computed step by step until reaching the outermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, the final result is computed efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which can be broken down into layers. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (L1 = 1 + 3 = 4), compute each subsequent layer up to L9:\n   - L1 = 4\n   - L2 = 13\n   - L3 = 40\n   - L4 = 121\n   - L5 = 364\n   - L6 = 1093\n   - L7 = 3280\n   - L8 = 9841\n   - L9 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Computation:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer (L9) by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many times the 3 is multiplied. Starting from the left, each time we have a 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus another expression. It looks like there are nine sets of these nested expressions. Wait, actually, if I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's nine. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by a new (1 + ...). So, to solve this, I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me write this down step by step. Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, E1 = (1 + 3) E2 = 3*(1 + E1) E3 = 3*(1 + E2) ... and so on, up to E9 = 3*(1 + E8) Then, the entire expression is E9. Wait, but the problem is 3*(1 + E8), so maybe E9 is 3*(1 + E8). Let me make sure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's E1. Then, E2 = 3*(1 + E1). E3 = 3*(1 + E2), and so on until E9. So, to compute E9, I need to compute E1 through E9 step by step. Let's start with E1. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Okay, moving on to E3. E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, so E3 is 48. Next, E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. That's getting bigger quickly. E5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Wow, that's a jump. E6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Okay, E7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Wow, this is growing exponentially. E8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. And finally, E9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. So, after computing each step, the final result is 36,084. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. E3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. E4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. E5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. E6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. E7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. E8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. E9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It's similar to a geometric series but with multiplication inside. Each step is 3*(1 + previous step). So, let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula for En. Let me denote En = 3*(1 + En-1). With E1 = 4. So, E2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, E3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc. Let me see if I can express En in terms of E1. Let's try to write out the first few terms: E1 = 4 = 3 + 1 E2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 E3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 E4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 E5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 E6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 E7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 E8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 E9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 So, each En is 3 times (1 + En-1). Let me see if I can find a general formula for En. Let's try to unroll the recurrence relation. En = 3*(1 + En-1) Let's expand this: En = 3 + 3En-1 Similarly, En-1 = 3 + 3En-2 So, substituting back, En = 3 + 3*(3 + 3En-2) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3En-2 = 3 + 9 + 9En-2 Continuing this way, we can see that each step adds another power of 3. So, in general, En = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3^n + 3^{n} * E1 Wait, but E1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe En = 3^{n} * E1 - 3^{n} + 1? Let me test this formula for n=1: E1 = 3^1 * 4 - 3^1 +1 = 12 -3 +1=10. Wait, that's not correct because E1 is 4. So, maybe my formula is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence is En = 3 + 3En-1, with E1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is En = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, but since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's try a constant particular solution. Let En = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3C => C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. So, the general solution is En = A*3^n + (-3/2). Applying the initial condition E1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5/3 = 11/6. So, En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. Simplifying, En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. Let's test this for n=1: En = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 -3)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: En = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 =15. Correct. For n=3: En = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - 3/2 = 96/2=48. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. Now, in our problem, n=9 because there are nine layers. So, E9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. Let's compute 3^9 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, E9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. Let's compute (11/6)*19683 first. 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5. Then, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 *11= 36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36080 +5.5=36085.5. Now, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5. So, 36085.5 -1.5=36084. So, E9=36084. That matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 3. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me start there. Let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, that's a layer. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, the first layer is (1 + 3), then that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and so on. How many layers are there? Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. I can count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see: 3(1 + 3(...)) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis. I think there are 9 layers here because each time you go one step out, you add another layer. Let me confirm: Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n...\nUp to 9 layers. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, each time it's 3 multiplied by the next layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis after a 3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then moving outward, each time we have another layer. Let's count the number of layers. Each time you have a 3 followed by a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2014 that's the innermost, layer 1.\n\nThen moving out, each 3(...) is another layer:\n\n2. 3(1 + 3) \u2014 but actually, that's part of the next layer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just start calculating from the innermost and work my way out. So, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nS1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(S1). So:\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen:\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. If S3 is 40, then 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by S9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing S9, which is 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that S9 is indeed 29524. Let me go back through each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculations.\n\nStarting with S1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo S9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication because sometimes when you carry over, you might make a mistake.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount how many layers you have. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each time you have a 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let's count the number of times 3 is followed by a parenthesis.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nWait, actually, each layer adds another 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nEach time you have a 3 followed by a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, that's the outermost layer. Then inside that, another 3(, and so on until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" occurrences:\n\n1. 3( at the very start.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(, so that's 2.\n\nContinuing, each time I see a 3(, that's a new layer.\n\nSo let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the first 3(, there's another 3(, and so on, up to how many?\n\nLet me write the expression again and count:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, that's layer 1.\n\nThen inside, another 3(, layer 2.\n\nContinuing:\n\nLayer 1: 3(\n\nLayer 2: 3(\n\nLayer 3: 3(\n\nLayer 4: 3(\n\nLayer 5: 3(\n\nLayer 6: 3(\n\nLayer 7: 3(\n\nLayer 8: 3(\n\nLayer 9: 3(\n\nWait, but in the expression, how many 3( are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3(, there are 8 more 3( because each time you have a 3 followed by a parenthesis.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"3(\" in the entire expression.\n\nStarting from the first character:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo the first 3( is the outermost layer.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(, and so on until the innermost.\n\nSo how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3( at the very start.\n\nThen inside, another 3(, so that's 2.\n\nContinuing, each time I see a 3(, that's a new layer.\n\nSo:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the first 3(, how many more are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo the first 3( is layer 1.\n\nThen inside, another 3(, that's layer 2.\n\nThen another 3(, layer 3.\n\nAnd so on, until the innermost 3(.\n\nBut in the expression, after the first 3(, there are 8 more 3( because each time you have a 3 followed by a parenthesis, except the last one which is just (1 + 3).\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is (1 + 3), so the number of \"3(\" is 8, because each time you have a 3( except the last one.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses in the entire expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\":\n\nStarting from the first character:\n\n3 ( 1 + 3 ( 1 + 3 ( 1 + 3 ( 1 + 3 ( 1 + 3 ( 1 + 3 ( 1 + 3 ( 1 + 3 )))))))))\n\nCounting each \"(\": \n\n1. After the first 3: (\n2. Then inside, another ( after 3: (\n3.

So the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the first \"3(\", then each subsequent \"3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the first \"3(\" is layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another \"3(\", layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 \"3(\" in the expression, meaning 9 layers.\n\nBut when I calculated earlier, I had S1 to S9, which matched 9 layers, resulting in S9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have a \"3(\" before a parenthesis.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, that's layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(, layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nSo, in the expression, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet me write the expression with each \"3(\" highlighted:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"3(\", that's 1.\n\nThen another \"3(\", that's 2.\n\nContinuing until the last \"3(\" before the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet's see:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there are 8 more \"3(\", because each time you have a 3(, except the last one which is just (1 + 3).\n\nWait, no, actually, each \"3(\" is a new layer. So the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\".\n\nSo, in the expression, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 \"3(\" in total. So that means there are 9 layers, each corresponding to S1 to S9.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation of S9=29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recount the layers step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so S9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check one more time by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's compute a smaller version with only 2 layers:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nTotal expression: 3*13 = 39\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, with 3 layers:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nTotal expression: 3*40 = 120\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another 3 times something). Let me count how many nested layers there are. Starting from the outside, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" before it starts closing. Hmm, let's see: 1. 3(1 + 3(...) 2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...) 3. And again, so on. Wait, actually, every time I go one layer in, I see another 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me try to count the number of layers. Starting from the outside: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by something, and that something is 1 plus another 3 multiplied by another expression. Let me see how many times this happens. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, maybe another approach is better. Let me write this expression as a series of nested operations. Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, since I can see that there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me check that. Starting from the innermost: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, wait, but when I look at the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this E1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(E1). So, that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this E2 = 13.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. That's E3 = 40.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(E3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. E4 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. E5 = 364.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(E5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 = 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(E7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(E9). So that's 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 524. But actually, 3*29524 can be computed as 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524: 3*500=1500, 3*24=72, so 1500 +72=1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, the outermost expression is 88573.\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 times that expression, right? Because the outermost structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost expression, we built up each layer, and the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(E9) = 88573. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*88573. Let's break it down: 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9. Wait, no, that's not correct because 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. Wait, actually, 88573 is 8*10,000 + 8*1,000 + 5*100 + 7*10 + 3*1. So, 3*88573 = 3*(8*10,000 + 8*1,000 + 5*100 + 7*10 + 3*1) = 3*8*10,000 + 3*8*1,000 + 3*5*100 + 3*7*10 + 3*3*1. Let's compute each term:\n\n- 3*8*10,000 = 24*10,000 = 240,000\n- 3*8*1,000 = 24*1,000 = 24,000\n- 3*5*100 = 15*100 = 1,500\n- 3*7*10 = 21*10 = 210\n- 3*3*1 = 9*1 = 9\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when breaking down numbers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3 directly:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1 and carry over 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 (carried) = 17, write down 7 and carry over 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 (carried) = 25, write down 5 and carry over 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 (carried) = 26, write down 6 and carry over 2\n\n3 * 0 (since there's no digit beyond the 8) would be 0 + 2 carried over, which is 2.\n\nWait, but 88573 is a 5-digit number, so when we multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write the carried 2.\n\nSo, the result is 265,719, which matches my earlier calculation. So, the total expression is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. I started from E1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until E9 = 29524, then the outermost expression is 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers again to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...), so that's the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? So, E1 to E9, which is what I did earlier. So, I think I counted correctly. Therefore, the final result should be 265,719.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost expression is 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nThen the total expression is 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time I go through it. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. So, maybe I can find a general formula for E_n in terms of n.\n\nThe recursive formula is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nSubstituting E_{n} = A*3^n + B,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nE_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each n, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6 = (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7 = (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8 = (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 1 + 3*E9 =1 + 3*29524=1 + 88572=88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*88573=265,719.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is E10 = (3^{11} -1)/2=177147 -1=177146/2=88573. Then, the total expression is 3*E10=3*88573=265,719.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 265,719 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step and even found a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed sequentially. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, \\(E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 88,573. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{265719}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next part. Let me count them. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, it's like a chain of nine terms. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's try that. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) And so on, up to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, if I compute layer 1 first, then layer 2, all the way up to layer 9, and then multiply by 3, I should get the answer. Let's start with layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, 40. That's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, that's a jump. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me think again. 29524 is 29,524. So, 3*29,524. Let me compute 30,000*3 = 90,000. But 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 3*29,524 = 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 3*476. Compute 3*476: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18, so 1200+210=1410+18=1428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Therefore, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer, I computed each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, multiplying layer 9 by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check some of these calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting with layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841. Wait, 841 is 29 squared, but 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123, so 2400 + 123 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let me compute this differently to verify. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading the numbers from bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me write it out properly.\n\nWait, 29524\n\ntimes 3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 88,572. Which matches what I had before. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought of 3*29,524 as 90,000 - 1,428, which is 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine sets of parentheses inside each other. That means I'll have to compute the innermost one first and then work my way outwards. Let me start by labeling each part to make it clearer. Let me denote each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s say E1 is the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving one level out, E2 would be 1 + 3*E1 Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which is the outermost expression. So, the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E9). Hmm, let me check that. The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So yes, if I define E1 as the innermost, then each subsequent E is built by 1 + 3*previous E. So, starting from E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's growing quickly. Let me write this down step by step to keep track:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check these calculations because they seem to be increasing rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with E1:  \nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(E9). So, let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \nLet's multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.  \n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.  \nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I worked my way out, calculating each E step by step, and each time, I checked my work. It seems consistent. The numbers are growing exponentially because each step is 1 plus three times the previous, which leads to rapid growth. So, after computing all nine levels, the outermost expression is 3*29524, which equals 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. Use \\( E_1 \\) to compute the next level:\n   - \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent expression:\n   - \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply \\( E_9 \\) by 3:\n   - \\( 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the left, each time I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each time there's a 3 followed by a parenthesis, so I think it's 8 layers deep. Let me check: 3(1+3(...)) and each time inside another 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, and working outwards. So perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that approach. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let me start from the innermost expression. Let me define each step as S1, S2, up to S8, where S1 is the innermost expression, and S8 is the outermost one. So S1 is 1 + 3. Then S2 is 1 + 3*S1. Then S3 is 1 + 3*S2, and so on until S8, which is the entire expression. Then the final answer would be 3*S8. Let me try writing this down step by step.\n\nFirst, S1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that. Because the original expression is 3*(S8). So after computing S8 as 9841, the final result would be 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So the final answer would be 29523.\n\nWait, but let me verify my steps because I might have made a mistake in computing S8. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with S1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nSo S8 is 9841, then the entire expression is 3*9841. Let me compute that again: 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we go out one layer. Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n...\n\nEach time we add another layer. So how many layers are there? Let's see: the expression is written as 3(1+3(...)) with eight sets of (1+3(...)) inside. So S1 is the innermost, S8 is the outermost. So I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recursive sequence. Let me think: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is built by this recursion. So a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_8. Then the entire expression is 3*a_8. So that's exactly what I did earlier. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, in this case, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. So let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + m is a_n = C*k^n + m/(1 - k), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nIn this case, k is 3, and m is 1. So the general solution would be a_n = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=8, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^9 is 19683, so a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So that's a good check.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523, as before. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me try that again, more carefully.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So I think I can be confident that the answer is 29523.\n\nWait, let me just check one more time using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^9 directly to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Yes, that's correct. So 3^9 is indeed 19683.\n\nSo, yes, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 29523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar expression)}\\). We compute this step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times S_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

The entire expression is \\(3 \\times S_8\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times S_8 = 3 \\times 9841 = 29523\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{29523}\\)."

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses, it looks like there are nine layers here. That means I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me write down each step as I go along. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. I'll number them from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9: 3*(Layer 8) Let me compute each layer step by step. **Layer 1:** The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** Continuing outward, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** Finally, Layer 9 is 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 29523. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each layer quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523. Correct. Okay, all layers check out. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. By systematically evaluating each layer, we find that the entire expression simplifies to 29523.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{29523}$."

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of nested expressions, it looks like there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). That means I need to compute the innermost part first and then work my way out, each time substituting the result back into the next layer. Let me try to represent this in a more manageable way. Let me denote each level as a step. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. Step 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 3 times that result, right? Wait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each step is 3*(previous result). Hmm, maybe I should represent each layer as a function of the previous one. Let me try to define it recursively. Let's say S(n) is the value of the expression with n layers. So, S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, S(2) = 1 + 3*S(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. S(3) = 1 + 3*S(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. S(4) = 1 + 3*S(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, wait a second, this seems like each S(n) is 1 + 3*S(n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me check if I'm on the right track. So, if I compute each S(n) step by step, starting from S(1) up to S(9), since the problem has nine layers, right? Because each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer, and the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression. Wait, no, actually, the outermost 3 is multiplying the entire expression, which itself has nine layers. So maybe S(n) is defined as 1 + 3*S(n-1), starting from S(0) = 1? Wait, let's see. Let me clarify. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, perhaps S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, S(2) = 3*(1 + 3*S(1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I compute S(2), it's 3*(1 + 3*S(1)), which would be 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39. Then S(3) would be 3*(1 + 3*S(2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Wait, but that seems like a different approach. Maybe I need to adjust how I'm defining S(n). Let me try to think differently. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Then, 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Then, 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Then, 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Finally, the outermost 3 is multiplied by this result, so 3*36084 = 108252. Wait, that seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me check each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Next, 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Next, 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Next, 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*36084 = 108252. Hmm, that seems correct, but I should verify each step to be sure. Let me recount the layers to ensure I haven't missed any. The original expression has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. Wait, but when I look at the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are nine (1 + 3(...)) layers, so maybe I've actually done ten layers? Wait, no, because the outermost 3 is separate from the layers. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) instances. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I have a (1 + 3), which is nine times, and then each is multiplied by 3 and added 1 in the next layer. So, I think my approach is correct. Let me check the calculations again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13; then multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, no, hold on. I think I might have confused myself earlier. Let me clarify: each layer is (1 + 3*previous result). So, starting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not correctly applying the layers. Let me try this again carefully, step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my first calculation. So, I think the confusion was whether each layer is (1 + 3*previous) or whether each layer is multiplied by 3 as part of the next layer. Let me make sure I'm applying the operations correctly.\n\nEach time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Wait, now I'm getting a different result again. I'm confused. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that I'm not correctly representing each layer. Let me think of it as building the expression from the inside out.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E(n), where n is the number of layers from the inside out. So, E(1) is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + E(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + E(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + E(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + E(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + E(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nE(9) = 3*(1 + E(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(E(9)) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 108,252 as the result. But earlier, when I thought of E(n) as (1 + 3*E(n-1)), I got 88,572. Hmm, I must be mixing up the definitions. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each step as:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: The next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nStep 3: The next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nStep 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nStep 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nStep 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nStep 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nStep 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nSo, that's nine steps, each time computing the next layer out. So, the final result is 108,252.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of E(n) as (1 + 3*E(n-1)), starting from E(1) = 4, and then E(2) = 13, E(3) = 40, etc., I ended up with a different result. I think the confusion was whether each E(n) is (1 + 3*E(n-1)) or whether it's 3*(1 + E(n-1)). It seems that each step is 3*(1 + previous result), which would mean E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)).\n\nWait, let's check that. If E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), then:\n\nE(1) = 3*(1 + E(0)), but E(0) would be 1, perhaps. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let me compute each layer step by step, from the inside out, carefully.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 108,252.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nNow, the outermost multiplication: 3*36084.\n\nCompute 36084 * 3:\n\n36084 * 3: 30,000*3=90,000; 6,000*3=18,000; 80*3=240; 4*3=12. So, adding up: 90,000 + 18,000 = 108,000; 108,000 + 240 = 108,240; 108,240 +12=108,252.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 108,252.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer from the inside out, we find the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Multiply by 3 and add 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Continue outward: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. **Layer 5**: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. **Layer 6**: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. **Layer 7**: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. **Layer 8**: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. **Layer 9**: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\n10. **Outermost Multiplication**: Finally, multiply by 3: 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{108252}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let's count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and each time we add another layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to break it down layer by layer. Maybe I can assign variables to each level to make it clearer. Let's say: Let\u2019s denote each nested expression as follows: Let\u2019s start from the innermost one and work our way out. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer), and so on. Since there are multiple layers, I need to compute each layer step by step. Let me list each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Let's number them from 1 to 9 because I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times the expression 1+3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then 1 + 3(...), and so on until the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since I can see that the outermost expression is 3*(...), which would be Layer 9. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. The expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1. Each time we have (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost Layer 9, because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\nFinal result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let's compute that again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, the pattern is (1+3(...)), so let's count how many times this occurs.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until we reach the outermost expression, which is 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The first 1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, my earlier calculation of Layer 1 through Layer 9 is correct, with Layer 9 being the innermost expression, and then each outer layer building on that.\n\nWait, no, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, actually, when I count from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer 1, then the next layer is Layer 2, up to Layer 9 being the outermost. But in the expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, in my earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer is built by adding another 1+3*(...). So, if I have 9 layers, then Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is 1+3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to 29,524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut let me verify the calculations again step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using both iterative step-by-step calculation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the final value is 29,524. Multiplying this by the outermost factor of 3 gives the result 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many times this nesting happens. Each time, we have 1 + 3(...). Let me see: starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me try to count them: 1. Innermost: (1 + 3) 2. Then 1 + 3*(result of 1) 3. Then 1 + 3*(result of 2) ... and so on until the outermost layer. Wait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 2)\n4. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 3)\n5. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 4)\n6. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 5)\n7. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 6)\n8. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 7)\n9. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 8)\n10. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 9)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? Because each time, we're adding another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...), up to layer 9. So, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, I need to compute starting from layer 1 and work my way up to layer 9, then multiply by 3 at the end. Alternatively, the entire expression is 3 times the result of layer 9. Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen the final result is 3*L9.\n\nSo, I can compute L1 first, then L2, and so on up to L9, then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4: 12\n\nSo, L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nMoving on to L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nSo, L3 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 120\n\nSo, L4 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 363\n\nSo, L5 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nProceeding to L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092\n\nSo, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext, L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279\n\nSo, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nMoving on to L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240=9840\n\nSo, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's compute this carefully.\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nTherefore, L9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, so 3*29,524\n\nCompute that:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\nLet's compute:\n\n20,000*3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just verify that I didn't make any computation errors along the way. Let me recheck each step quickly.\n\nStarting with L1: 1+3=4, correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29,523=29,524, correct.\n\nThen, final step: 3*29,524=88,572, correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here to avoid computing each layer step by step, but since it's only 9 layers, maybe it's not too bad. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nEach layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of L9=29,524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\), where each \\( L_n \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply \\( L_9 \\) by 3 to get the result:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot L_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so now I can replace that innermost part with 4. So, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 is 12. Then, we have 1 plus that 12, which would be 13. Let me write that down step by step to keep track. Let me number each step as I go from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have:\n\nStep 2: Compute 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nThen, add 1 to that result:\n\nStep 3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now the next level out is another set of parentheses. Let me see if I can follow this pattern. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, the next step would be to take the 13 from step 3 and plug it into the next level.\n\nSo, step 4: Compute 3 * 13 = 39.\n\nThen, step 5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, interesting. It seems like each time we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check if this pattern continues.\n\nContinuing this way, step 6: 3 * 40 = 120.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 8: 3 * 121 = 363.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my steps because I might have miscounted the number of levels. Let me recount the number of parentheses to ensure I'm working through each level correctly.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see there are 9 sets. So, each time I compute a step, I'm moving outward one level. Let me make sure I have 9 steps after the initial innermost computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me structure it as a sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nLet me denote each level as a term in a sequence. Let's say:\n\nLet a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082.\n\nAnd so on, up to a\u2089, since there are 9 levels.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so perhaps the total expression is 3*a\u2089. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the entire expression is 3 times the result of the innermost expression, which is a\u2089. So, first, I compute a\u2081, then a\u2082, and so on until a\u2089, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let me structure this properly.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut let me verify each step because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake.\n\nStarting from a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again using another method to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I started, I considered a\u2081 as the innermost (1+3). But in the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each next level is (1 + 3*(previous level)), and this happens 9 times, so the outermost expression is 3*(a\u2089). So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric sequence? Let me think. The expression seems to follow a pattern where each term is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, whose solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na\u2081 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for a\u2089, which is the 9th term, n=9.\n\na\u2089 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^10 again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute each step manually again to confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next level out and compute:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 = 12 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent level:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   3 \\times 13 &= 39 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   3 \\times 40 &= 120 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   3 \\times 121 &= 363 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   3 \\times 364 &= 1092 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   3 \\times 1093 &= 3279 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   3 \\times 3280 &= 9840 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   3 \\times 9841 &= 29523 \\quad \\text{then} \\quad 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The result of the innermost expression after 9 levels is \\(29524\\).\n\n5. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many layers there are here. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. Let's see: 1. Innermost: (1 + 3) 2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous) 3. Then another layer: 1 + 3*(previous) and so on. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So perhaps the expression is built up with 9 layers of nesting. That means I'll need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and work my way outward. Let me try to represent each layer as a step. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is the result of a layer. Let me say that starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me call that term a1.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen the next layer out is 1 + 3*a1, which would be a2.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen the next layer out is a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, let me check that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yes.\n\nThen a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So if I have a1 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. Then a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, that's right. a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, yes. a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, yes. a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(a9). Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer. So after computing a9 = 29524, then the total result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a9), where a9 is the value after 9 layers. So the total is 3*a9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524: let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 29,524.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7         3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the number is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure that the a9 value is correct. Because if I messed up any step in computing a1 through a9, then the final result will be wrong.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So a9 is indeed 29,524, and then 3*a9 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n- Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n- And so on, until the outermost layer, which is 3*(...).\n\nWait, so how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by the number of times 3 is multiplied. Alternatively, perhaps I can see that the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested within the previous one, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me represent each layer as a function. Let me denote f(n) as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost. So f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to f(9) = 29,524. Then the total expression is 3*f(9) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that there are indeed 9 layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each adding another \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nTherefore, f(9) = 29,524, and the total expression is 3*f(9) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few more layers manually to check if the pattern holds.\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step is 1 plus 3 times the previous step. So the pattern is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 times a9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to cross-verify, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's break down 29,524:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo 3 \u00d7 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 \u00d7 9,000 = 27,000\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1,500\n\n3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just check one more time to be absolutely sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial layers.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait a second, maybe I can find a general formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can find B by considering the steady-state solution. If a_n = a_{n-1} = B, then B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a1 = 4, we can find A.\n\nAt n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a9 = 88,572.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 3s, I think there are nine 3s multiplied by terms, each time adding 1. Hmm, maybe I can count the number of layers or the depth of the expression. Let me try to count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3 times a term. So, let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12, then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39, then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120, then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363, then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092, then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279, then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840, then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523, then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, when I started counting, the innermost was (1 + 3), which is the first step. Then each subsequent step adds another layer. So, if I have nine 3s, does that mean I have nine layers? Let me check the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1 + 3, then 3 times that, then 1 + 3 times that, and so on. Let me try to count how many times the innermost (1 + 3) occurs. Each opening parenthesis adds another layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, starting with layer 1 as (1 + 3), layer 2 as 3*(1 + 3) + 1, and so on up to layer 9. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) + 1 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost layers, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. But in my layers above, Layer 9 is the outermost expression, which would be 3*(Layer 8) + 1. But wait, looking back at the original problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(previous layer) + 1, except the outermost one, which is just 3*(innermost). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(previous layer) + 1, starting from the innermost. So the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then the next layer is 3*(4) + 1 = 13. Then the next is 3*(13) + 1 = 40, and so on, up to the ninth layer. So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, that would be the value inside the outermost 3*(...). But wait, in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would mean that after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, that's the value of the innermost expression, and then the outermost operation is 3*29524. Wait, no, because in my layers, Layer 9 is 29524, which is 3*(Layer 8) + 1, so that would be the value of the expression starting from the innermost. But in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nLet me try to structure this better. Let me number the layers starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) + 1. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) + 1 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost expression, which is up to Layer 9, which is 29524, that would be the value of the innermost (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my layers, Layer 9 is 29524, which is the result of 3*(Layer 8) + 1, so that's the value of the expression starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by that. So, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, so the total would be 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm this step-by-step, because I might have made a mistake in my earlier layers.\n\nWait, let me go back to the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(13) + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(40) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(121) + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(364) + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1093) + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(3280) + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(9841) + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine 3s inside, each time multiplied by the inner expression. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...) +1. So, if I have nine layers, then the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the outermost operation is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 3s. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(previous) +1, and after nine layers, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term.\n\nIn this case, k = 3, c = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, but our initial term is a_1 = 4, which is after the first step. So, perhaps I can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, for n = 1: a_1 = 4\n\nn = 2: a_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nn = 3: a_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to n = 9: a_9 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the outermost operation multiplies this result by 3. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))). Let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, each time I see a 1 + 3(...). Let's see: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) 4. And so on, until there are nine levels of nesting. Wait, actually, let me check that again. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3 times another similar expression, and each of those is another 1 + 3 times another, and so on. So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each step adds another layer. So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent parenthesis adds a layer. Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))). So, from the innermost 1 + 3, each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s: starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each time you have a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, E3, etc., where E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on until E9, which would be the entire expression multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*(E8), and so on. Hmm, maybe it's better to start with E1 and compute each step. Let me try that. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(E9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572, so adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So the result should be 88,572. Wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3.\n\nLet's compute 29524*3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from bottom to top: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. Let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations in between. Each step seems to build correctly on the previous one, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and substituting it into the next layer until the entire expression is evaluated. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Start from the innermost layer:**\n   - E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:**\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - Final result = 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Let me see: starting from the inside, each time there's a 1 + 3, then each of those is multiplied by 3 and added to another 1, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the first 3, I see that each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times this happens. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, actually, let me see: the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)) and there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me write it out step by step. Starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that, so 3*(1 + 3). Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the next layer is 3 times that, and so on. Wait, maybe it's better to represent each layer as a separate step. Let me try to define each step as a function. Let me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers. So, the innermost expression is E_1 = 1 + 3. Then, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1. E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, until E_9, since I think there are 9 layers here. Wait, let me check the original expression again to make sure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times the (1 + 3(...)) appears. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3), then each time we have another (1 + 3(...)), so perhaps there are 9 layers because the problem has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, actually, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...): Starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). Let's see: starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until there are 9 layers. Wait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the first 3, it's 3*(...), and inside that, there's another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3*(...)) occurs. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then each time we have another (1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is the number of times we can nest this. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3*(...)), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), which is the second layer, and so on, until the ninth layer. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. ...*(1 + 3*(...\n3. ...*(1 + 3*(...\n4. ...*(1 + 3*(...\n5. ...*(1 + 3*(...\n6. ...*(1 + 3*(...\n7. ...*(1 + 3*(...\n8. ...*(1 + 3*(...\n9. ...*(1 + 3))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps we have 9 layers, each adding another (1 + 3*E), where E is the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression, which is (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the total expression is 3*E_9, where E_9 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another (1 + 3*E), where E is the previous layer. So, if I compute E_1 through E_9, and then multiply by 3, that would give me the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and moving outward. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3*(...)) occurs. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3).\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, until layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections. Let me write it out:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3).\n\n- Then, moving outward, each time it's (1 + 3*(...)), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but that seems like 9 layers, each time adding another (1 + 3*E). So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression becomes 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing each E_n, where E_1 is the innermost expression, and E_9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7.\n\n524 * 3 = 1572, plus 7 carried over is 1579. Write down 9, carry over 7.\n\n952 * 3 = 2856, plus 7 carried over is 2863. Write down 3, carry over 6.\n\n29 * 3 = 87, plus 6 carried over is 93. Write down 3, carry over 9.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6, plus 9 carried over is 15. Write down 5 and 1.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way to compute it. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n_________\n\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. I assumed there are 9 layers, but let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), so:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed E_9, I had 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, 9 layers, each with E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*E_9 = 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations for each E_n to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nE_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check E_7 again. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE_8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE_9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3.\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Is there a better way to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step? Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nEach E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume E_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for E_9, n=9: E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the recurrence relation \\(E_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_{n-1}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   E_2 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13, \\\\\n   E_3 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40, \\\\\n   E_4 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121, \\\\\n   E_5 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364, \\\\\n   E_6 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093, \\\\\n   E_7 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280, \\\\\n   E_8 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841, \\\\\n   E_9 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\cdot E_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, which is just 1+3, then each time we add another layer. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then that's part of the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(previous). So, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and another addition of 1. Let me count the number of 1+3... parts. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time, wrapping another 1 + 3(...). How many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, maybe I should think of it as 9 layers? Let me check: The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3)))))))))). So, each time, we have a 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers. Wait, let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(...)\". Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost out, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then that's part of the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(1+3), then that's part of the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, but let me make sure. So, if I start from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the number of layers is 9? Let me check: The expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, yes, 9 layers. So, I can compute this by starting from the innermost layer and working my way out, each time computing the value of the current layer and substituting it into the next outer layer. That sounds manageable. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000\n\n500\u00d73=1500\n\n20\u00d73=60\n\n4\u00d73=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since there are only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, let me compute it again using the formula.\n\nGiven that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but I think the way I did it is sufficient.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))). Hmm, so there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3 times the next one. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. Let me try to simplify this step by step. Maybe I can work from the inside out, calculating each layer one by one. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count: each time I go out one layer, I add another 1 + 3(...). Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n10. Finally, multiply by 3.\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers inside the initial 3(...). Let me make sure: the problem is 3 times a big expression, which itself is 1 + 3 times another expression, and so on, until there are nine 1+3(...) layers. So, that's correct, nine layers. So, I need to compute each layer from the inside out, up to nine times, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me write down each step:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9.\n\nOkay, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, L2 = 13\n\nMoving on to L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, L3 = 40\n\nNext, L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 120\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3 = 360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840.

So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, L9 = 29524\n\nNow, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524\n\nCompute that: 29524*3\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think all the steps check out.

So, this is a nested expression that repeats nine times. To make this manageable, I'll start by solving the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let's denote each level as follows: Level 1: 1 + 3 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) And so on, up to Level 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so Level 1 is the innermost 1 + 3, and each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Level 1: 1+3=4, correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). If I let a_n be the value at level n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging in the initial condition, when n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3 + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, if the series converges, but in this case, since we have a finite number of levels (n=9), we can solve it iteratively as I did before. But since the problem only requires computing up to n=9, the step-by-step approach is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so after n steps, starting from 1, the value would be (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that formula. Wait, if we have a recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1, then the solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. Let's see, for n=0, a_0=1. For n=1, a_1=3*1 +1=4. Using the formula: (3^{1+1} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches. For n=2, a_2=3*4 +1=13. Formula: (3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, correct. For n=3, a_3=3*13 +1=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 levels, starting from the innermost as a_1=4, up to a_9. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost is 1+3=4, which is a_1=4. Then, each subsequent level is a_2, a_3,... up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, a_n = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the value is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each level up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth level by 3. The final answer is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here. Wait, actually, let me count them. Starting from the innermost, each time I add another layer. Let me count the number of 3s as well. Hmm, maybe it's better to just start computing from the inside and work my way out. That way, I can handle each layer step by step without getting confused. Let me write down each step as I go. So, starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))) Next layer out: 1 + 3(13). Let's compute 3 times 13 first, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 equals 40. So now, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))))) Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(40). 3 times 40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Updating the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))))))) Next layer: 1 + 3(121). 3 times 121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Now, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))) Next layer: 1 + 3(364). 3 times 364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Updating the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))) Next layer: 1 + 3(1093). 3 times 1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Now, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(3280)) Next layer: 1 + 3(3280). 3 times 3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. Updating the expression: 3(9841) Finally, the outermost layer: 3 times 9841. Let me compute that. 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, putting it all together, the result is 29523. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=1+12=13. Next, 1+3*13=1+39=40. Then, 1+3*40=1+120=121. Next, 1+3*121=1+363=364. Then, 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Next, 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Finally, 3*9841=29523. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many layers there are here. Each time I see a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me count: starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each subsequent 3 is inside. Let me see... 3(1 + 3(...)) so each time it's a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s before the first innermost 1+3. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think of it as having multiple layers, each with 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me try to represent this as a series of nested expressions. Let me denote each layer as a term. Let's say the innermost expression is E1, then the next one is E2, and so on, up to E9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me parse the expression. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let me define E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2. And so on, until E9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, but looking at the original problem, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire expression. So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is the outermost layer. Let me confirm: the expression is 3*(E9), where E9 = 1 + 3*(E8), and E8 = 1 + 3*(E7), etc., down to E1 = 1 + 3. So, there are 9 layers in total. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, compute E1 = 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, that might be too broken down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 + 3 times another set. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that with another 3(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let's start by labeling each layer to make it easier. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) Layer 3: 3(1 + Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 3(1 + Layer 8). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 3 times (1 + Layer 1). Wait, Layer 1 is 4, so Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that: 1 + 4 = 5, then 3*5 = 15. So Layer 2 is 15.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2). Layer 2 is 15, so 1 + 15 = 16, then 3*16 = 48. So Layer 3 is 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3). Layer 3 is 48, so 1 + 48 = 49, then 3*49 = 147. Layer 4 is 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4). Layer 4 is 147, so 1 + 147 = 148, then 3*148. Let me compute that: 148*3. 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. Adding them together: 300+120=420, 420+24=444. So Layer 5 is 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5). Layer 5 is 444, so 1 + 444 = 445. Then 3*445. Let me calculate that: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. Adding them: 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. So Layer 6 is 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1335, so 1 + 1335 = 1336. Then 3*1336. Let me compute that: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. Adding up: 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. So Layer 7 is 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7). Layer 7 is 4008, so 1 + 4008 = 4009. Then 3*4009. Hmm, 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000 + 27 = 12027. So Layer 8 is 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8). Layer 8 is 12027, so 1 + 12027 = 12028. Then 3*12028. Let me calculate that: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So 36000 + 84 = 36084. So Layer 9 is 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each layer seems to compute correctly. So the final result is 36084. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each time we wrap around with another 3*(1 + ...), so each additional set of parentheses adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the first is 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, how many layers? Each time we have another 3(1+...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers? Wait, no, the first 3 is outside all the layers, and then each inner 3 adds a layer. Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big expression, which is 1 + 3*(another expression). That another expression is 1 + 3*(another), and so on, until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1+3) is Layer 1, then each step out adds a layer. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) expressions. Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are 8 more 3(1+3(...)) expressions. Wait, no, let me look:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: (1+3). Then each step out adds another 3(1+...). Let's count the number of 3(1+...):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 8 layers inside the initial 3. Because the first 3 is multiplied by the entire expression, which has 8 layers. Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around with 3*(1 + ...). So, each 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer. Let's count how many layers there are:\n\nAfter the innermost, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3) = Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer1) = Layer2\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer2) = Layer3\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer3) = Layer4\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer4) = Layer5\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer5) = Layer6\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer6) = Layer7\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer7) = Layer8\n\n- 3*(1 + Layer8) = Layer9\n\nWait, so actually, starting from Layer1, each subsequent layer adds one more layer, so from Layer1 to Layer9, there are 9 layers in total. But when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on, until there are 8 layers inside the initial 3. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. So, I think my initial counting was correct, that there are 9 layers, from Layer1 to Layer9, with Layer1 being the innermost (1+3). So, my previous calculation where I went up to Layer9 being 36084 is correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recount the layers as I compute them:\n\nLayer1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1+4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1+15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1+48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1+147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1+444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1+1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1+4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1+12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 36084. Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Sometimes, when you have a nested expression like this, you can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable, but maybe recognizing a pattern could help verify the result.\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern here. Each layer is defined as L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), where L1 = 4.\n\nSo, L1 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each term is 3 times (1 + previous term). This seems like a recursive sequence.\n\nIn general, for such a recursive sequence, we can model it as L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = (8/2 + 3/2) = 11/2\n\nTherefore, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL5 = (11*243 - 3)/2 = (2673 - 3)/2 = 2670/2 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nL6 = (11*729 - 3)/2 = (8019 - 3)/2 = 8016/2 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nL7 = (11*2187 - 3)/2 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027. Wait, but earlier I had Layer7 as 4008. Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in my earlier calculation, Layer7 was 4008, but according to this formula, L7 would be (11*3^6 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^6: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729. So, L7 = (11*729 -3)/2 = (8019 -3)/2 = 8016/2 = 4008. Correct. So, my earlier calculation was correct.\n\nWait, but in the formula, n=7 corresponds to Layer7. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, Layer9 is L9 = (11*3^8 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, L9 = (11*6561 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\nFirst, 10*6561=65610\n\nThen, 1*6561=6561\n\nSo, 65610 + 6561 = 72171\n\nThen, subtract 3: 72171 - 3 = 72168\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084\n\nSo, L9 = 36084, which matches my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the formula confirms that the result is indeed 36084.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the result 36084. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern and deriving a closed-form formula, I confirmed that the result is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), which can be rewritten as L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and an additional 3 is added.\n\nThe general solution we found earlier, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2, shows that it's an exponential function with base 3, which makes sense given the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to express the final result as a sum.\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nBut since we've already computed it step by step and confirmed with the formula, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nIn any case, having double-checked with the formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined as 3 times (1 plus the previous term). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 3*(1 + previous term). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** (1 + 3) = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n   - **Layer 3:** 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n   - **Layer 4:** 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n   - **Layer 5:** 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n   - **Layer 6:** 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n   - **Layer 7:** 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n   - **Layer 8:** 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n   - **Layer 9:** 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\n3. **Verification with Formula:**\n   Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{11 \\times 3^{n-1} - 3}{2}\n   \\]\n   Applying this for n=9:\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{11 \\times 3^8 - 3}{2} = \\frac{11 \\times 6561 - 3}{2} = \\frac{72171 - 3}{2} = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{36084}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of nested expressions, I can see there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, let me count again. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...), so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see: 1. Innermost: (1 + 3) 2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) 3. Then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) Wait, maybe I should write them out one by one to see the pattern. Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is as above. Hmm, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is E1. Then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. So, I can compute E1 through E9 step by step, then multiply by 3 at the end. Let me start calculating each E step by step.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThat's easy enough. Now E2:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, E2 is 13. Now E3:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, E3 is 40. Moving on to E4:\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE4 is 121. Next, E5:\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE5 is 364. Now E6:\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE6 is 1093. Continuing to E7:\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE7 is 3280. Then E8:\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE8 is 9841. Finally, E9:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting with E1 through E9:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out. Each E value was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 is accurate. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series that can be evaluated step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, if I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). That suggests that I need to compute this expression starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and then work my way outwards. Let me try to represent this step by step. Let's denote each level of the expression as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost one. So, starting from Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1 result). So, Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9's result. So, the final step is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me break it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me check with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you're doing multiple levels, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the levels, which would throw off all the subsequent results. Let me go through each level again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093). Compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841). Compute 9841 *3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Level 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 29524, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or a formula. Since each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a1, then each subsequent level as a2, a3, up to a9, where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nSo, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see if we can find a recurrence relation here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using a different method, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level of the expression as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\) where each level is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\).\n\n1. Compute each level:\n   - Level 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Level 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Level 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Level 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Level 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Level 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Level 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Level 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Level 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Recognize the recurrence relation and solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence relation:\n   - The general solution for \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing the innermost parentheses with 4, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))) Now, let's compute the next layer. The next innermost expression is (1 + 3*4). Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Let me check. After replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result)). So, actually, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the expression now becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*13)))))))) Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the replacement. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I replace the innermost (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, starting from the innermost: Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Level 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Level 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Level 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Level 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Level 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me verify each step carefully because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me write down each level step by step to ensure I haven't missed anything.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOutermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and then added 1. Let me check one of the middle steps to be sure. For example, Level 5: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Level 6: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's right. Level 7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Yes. Level 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Level 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe the index starts at 1. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before, since the number of terms is manageable (only 9 layers). But just for thoroughness, let me try to model it with the recurrence formula.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841,\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524,\n\nThen the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute a few of the steps again.\n\nStarting from a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Hmm, but that's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would involve finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 =29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be absolutely certain that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. Substitute back and compute the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)  \n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\n4. Multiply the final result by 3:  \n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nAnswer:  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). Let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part, the first term is 1 + 3, then that result is multiplied by 3, and added to 1, and so on. Let me try to write this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count. Each time there's a \"1+\" followed by a 3 times another expression. Let me see: starting from the innermost, the first expression is 1 + 3, then 3*(that result) + 1, and so on. Wait, maybe I should approach it by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and then moving outward. So, let's start from the innermost part: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this Level 9 result. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, maybe a better way is to add them step by step. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it properly. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carryover.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps because it's easy to miscalculate, especially with so many levels.\n\nLet me go through each level again to check.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's 3(1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first level. Then each additional 3(1+...) adds another level. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\".\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the structure:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*(Level1)\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*(Level2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Level 9: 1+3*(Level8)\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent level adds another 1+3*(previous level). So, from the innermost, we have 9 levels, each time adding another 1+3*(...). So, yes, 9 levels in total, which corresponds to the 9 sets of parentheses I evaluated earlier.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each time, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula, which might save time instead of computing each level step by step. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Level 9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that the step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). By evaluating each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). We'll evaluate each level starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Evaluate Innermost Parentheses**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of Level 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the left, each time I see a 3 followed by a set of parentheses. Let me count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...)) 2. 3(1 + 3(...)) 3. 3(1 + 3(...)) 4. 3(1 + 3(...)) 5. 3(1 + 3(...)) 6. 3(1 + 3(...)) 7. 3(1 + 3(...)) 8. 3(1 + 3(...)) 9. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) So, it looks like there are nine layers here, each time adding another 3(1 + ...) structure. So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and working my way out. Let me write this down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me denote each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost. \n\nStarting with the innermost part:\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result of S1). So:\n\nS2: 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, moving another step out, it's 1 + 3*(result of S2):\n\nS3: 1 + 3*(S2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nS4: 1 + 3*(S3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*(S4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*(S5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*(S6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*(S7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*(S8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times (the entire nested expression). So after computing S9, which is the outermost expression, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\nFinal result: 3*(S9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: \n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Let me go through each S1 to S9 again.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 3(1+...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the right, each time I see a 3(1+...). Let me count the number of times 3(1+...) appears.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3)\n\n2. 3(1+3(1+3))\n\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nSo, that's nine layers, each adding another 3(1+...). So, S1 to S9 is correct, each step building on the previous one. So, the calculations seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula. Each time, we have a term that's 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series if it's a linear homogeneous recurrence relation. Wait, but in this case, it's a non-homogeneous recurrence because of the constant term 1. So, maybe I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + d, where k and d are constants. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nIn this case, k = 3 and d = 1.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. Let's say when n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the number of layers is 9, starting from S1 to S9. So, for n=1, S1=4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, S2 = 13, which should be (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nS3 = 40, which is (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, for S9, which is the outermost expression, n=9:\n\nS9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, S9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step expansion and using the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, the total can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut since we already have the formula for a_n, I think that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*S9 again:\n\n3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked all my steps, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find the outermost expression equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After nine layers, the outermost expression is 29524.\n4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the next inner expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, that means there are 9 layers here. Wait, actually, let me check again. Each time I see a \"1 + 3\", that's the innermost part, and then each layer wraps around it with another \"1 + 3*(...)\". So, if I start from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on, up to 9 layers. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L2 is 13. Next, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, L3 is 40. Moving on, L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. L4 is 121. L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 + 1 is 364. So, L5 is 364. Now, L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, L6 is 1093. Next, L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, L7 is 3280. Now, L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, L8 is 9841. Finally, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, that's 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524*3 can be computed as 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 is 87000, 524*3: 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, 1500 + 72 is 1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify that again. 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, another way to compute this might be to recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive formula, but since the numbers get large quickly, step-by-step computation seems manageable. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 before the first closing parenthesis: starting from the innermost, there are nine 1+3 terms. Wait, no, actually, each layer adds one more 3*(...). Let me try to parse it correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, that would mean 9 layers, which is consistent with what I did earlier. So, L1 to L9, each layer computed step by step. Therefore, I think my approach is correct, and the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. After calculating each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer's value is computed by multiplying the previous layer's value by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process for all nine layers and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, if I count the number of innermost expressions, I think there are nine sets of (1 + 3) before the outermost 3 is applied. Let me check that. Starting from the innermost part: The first innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. So, the structure is like a tree with each node having one child until the ninth level. Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me define each part as a function or variable to simplify. Let's denote each inner expression as a variable. Let me try to define it step by step. Let me start by computing the innermost expression first. Let's call the innermost part as A1: A1 = 1 + 3 Then, the next layer out would be A2 = 1 + 3*A1 Then, A3 = 1 + 3*A2, and so on, up to A9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer, then each time I go outward, it's another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so each time that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3, then inside it is 1 + 3(...). Each time I go inside, there's another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3. Let me write them out:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n10. ...1 + 3)))\n\nWait, so from the outermost 3, each time I go into the next (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the first layer, which is the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1, then each layer above that is another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working out. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then, moving outward, each expression is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have nine layers, that would mean I have to compute A1 through A9, where each A(n) = 1 + 3*A(n-1), starting from A1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the outermost, the first (1 + 3( is layer 1, then inside that is another (1 + 3(, which is layer 2, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n10. ...1 + 3))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so I think I need to compute up to A9. So, A1 is the innermost, A2 is the next layer out, up to A9, and then the entire expression is 3*A9.\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm that. The entire expression is 3*(A9), where A9 is the outermost (1 + 3*(A8)), and so on. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation where each A(n) = 1 + 3*A(n-1), starting from A1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but maybe I should index it differently. Let me try to define it more clearly. Let me think: The innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is A1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*A1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let me call that A2. Then, the next layer out would be (1 + 3*A2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Let me call that A3. I can see a pattern forming here, perhaps. Let me compute a few more to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so A9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*A9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(A9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that step-by-step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carry\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, no carry\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I computed A9 correctly because if I made a mistake in A9, then the final answer will be wrong. Let me go back through each A(n) step by step.\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, A9 is indeed 29524, and 3*A9 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers. I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of A(n) terms. Starting from A1 to A9, that's nine terms, which would correspond to nine layers. But when I look at the original expression, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear?\n\nStarting from the outermost 3, each time I see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n10. ...1 + 3))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\" inside each other, so I think A9 is correct as the outermost expression before the final 3 multiplier. So, the total expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it another way to verify. Maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think: The recurrence relation is A(n) = 1 + 3*A(n-1), with A(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for A(n). Let me try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving A(n) = 3*A(n-1), which has the solution A_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is A(n) = A_h(n) + A_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition A(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is A(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, A(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me test it with n=1: A(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: A(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3: A(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, A(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, A(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, A(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*A(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That checks out.\n\nWait, 476 \u00d7 3: 400\u00d73=1200, 70\u00d73=210, 6\u00d73=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Define each inner expression as \\(A_n\\), where \\(A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1}\\) starting from \\(A_1 = 1 + 3\\).\n\n2. Compute each \\(A_n\\) step by step:\n   - \\(A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(A_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - \\(A_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(A_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(A_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(A_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(A_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(A_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(A_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. The entire expression is \\(3 \\times A_9\\):\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, if I count the number of opening parentheses, it seems like there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by another (1 + 3(...)), so maybe there are eight layers? Hmm, maybe I should just start simplifying from the innermost part. Let me try that. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, the next layer out is 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Now, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + ...). The inner part is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Then, the next layer is 3 multiplied by 13, which is 39. Let me try to keep track of this. Maybe I can write each step down:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Next layer: 3 * 13 = 39\n5. Next: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Next layer: 3 * 40 = 120\n7. Next: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Next layer: 3 * 121 = 363\n9. Next: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Next layer: 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. Next: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Next layer: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. Next: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Next layer: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. Next: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. Next layer: 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of steps, and each time I'm just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But let me check if I counted correctly. Each time, I have a (1 + 3*(previous result)), so maybe I can represent this as a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each step as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a\u2081 is the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, a\u2082 would be 3 * a\u2081 + 1? Wait, no, actually, looking back, each step after the first is (1 + 3*(previous term)). So, maybe the recurrence is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. Let me verify that with the steps I took earlier.\n\nIf a\u2081 = 4, then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches my earlier step 3. Then, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is step 5. Continuing, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is step 7. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, step 9. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, step 11. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, step 13. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, step 15. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, step 17? Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to 29523, which is 3*9841, but I think I might have missed the final step.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count how many times the expression repeats. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is one layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first inner is (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, so perhaps there are eight layers of (1 + 3(...)), each multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer adds another (1 + 3*previous). So, maybe I have eight terms in the sequence a\u2081 to a\u2088, where a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 13, a\u2083 = 40, a\u2084 = 121, a\u2085 = 364, a\u2086 = 1093, a\u2087 = 3280, a\u2088 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2088. So, 3*9841 = 29523. That seems to be the result.\n\nWait, let me check that again because earlier when I was counting steps, I ended up with 29523, but when I thought about the sequence, I had a\u2089 = 29524. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLet me recount the layers in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of these:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first inner is (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another (1 + 3(...))\n4. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. How many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 1.\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), layer 2.\n- Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3), which would be layer 9? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outside:\n\n- The first term is 3*(1 + ...)\n- Inside that, the next term is 3*(1 + ...)\n- This repeats until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3s that are multiplying the (1 + ...):\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one multiplication.\n- Then inside, another 3*(1 + ...), that's two.\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is (1 + 3), so that's nine layers? Wait, no, because each time we have a 3 followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so maybe the number of layers is eight, since the innermost is just (1 + 3), without another 3 after that. Let me see:\n\nLet me parse the expression step by step, starting from the outside:\n\n1. The entire expression is 3*(A), where A = (1 + 3*(B))\n2. B = (1 + 3*(C))\n3. C = (1 + 3*(D))\n4. D = (1 + 3*(E))\n5. E = (1 + 3*(F))\n6. F = (1 + 3*(G))\n7. G = (1 + 3*(H))\n8. H = (1 + 3*(I))\n9. I = (1 + 3)\n\nSo, from the outside, there are nine layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the first A down to I. So, each layer is defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4 (since I = (1 + 3) = 4).\n\nSo, with a\u2081 = 4, then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, so then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(A), where A = a\u2089.\n\nSo, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 29523. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to list each a\u2099 step by step:\n\n- a\u2081 = (1 + 3) = 4\n- a\u2082 = (1 + 3*a\u2081) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- a\u2083 = (1 + 3*a\u2082) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- a\u2084 = (1 + 3*a\u2083) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- a\u2085 = (1 + 3*a\u2084) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- a\u2086 = (1 + 3*a\u2085) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- a\u2087 = (1 + 3*a\u2086) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- a\u2088 = (1 + 3*a\u2087) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- a\u2089 = (1 + 3*a\u2088) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I was computing step by step, I thought the final result was 29523, which is 3*a\u2088, where a\u2088 = 9841. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThen, each layer is (1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081). Let me count how many a's there are.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = a\u2081 = 4\n2. (1 + 3*a\u2081) = a\u2082 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*a\u2082) = a\u2083 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*a\u2083) = a\u2084 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*a\u2084) = a\u2085 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*a\u2085) = a\u2086 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*a\u2086) = a\u2087 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*a\u2087) = a\u2088 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*a\u2088) = a\u2089 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I first computed step by step, I ended up at 29523, which is 3*a\u2088, not 3*a\u2089. So, perhaps I miscounted how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of a's is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Each time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, how many times does (1 + 3(...)) occur? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\nIn the original expression, starting from the first 3, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nEach * indicates a multiplication by 3. So, the number of layers is the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s before a (1 + ...):\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3*(...)), so that's one layer.\n- Then inside, another 3*(1 + ...), that's two.\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - layer 1\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)) - layer 2\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3), which would be layer 9? Wait, no, because each layer adds one more, so maybe 8 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), which is eight times, since the innermost is (1 + 3) without another 3 after that.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again:\n\n- The entire expression is 3*(A), where A = (1 + 3*(B))\n- B = (1 + 3*(C))\n- C = (1 + 3*(D))\n- D = (1 + 3*(E))\n- E = (1 + 3*(F))\n- F = (1 + 3*(G))\n- G = (1 + 3*(H))\n- H = (1 + 3*(I))\n- I = (1 + 3)\n\nSo, from the outermost 3*A down to I, that's nine layers. Therefore, a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 13, ..., a\u2089 = 29524. Thus, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I only went up to a\u2088 = 9841 and thought the final answer was 3*a\u2088 = 29523. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me verify the number of layers again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, starting from the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) - first layer\n2. Then inside, another 3(1 + 3(...)) - second layer\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, meaning a\u2081 to a\u2089. Therefore, the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check this again by computing each a\u2099 step by step, ensuring I don't miscount.\n\n1. a\u2081 = (1 + 3) = 4\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, so a\u2089 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought the innermost was a\u2081 = 4, then a\u2082 = 13, a\u2083 = 40, up to a\u2088 = 9841, and then the expression is 3*a\u2088 = 29523. But that must be incorrect because the original expression has nine layers, so a\u2089 is 29524, and then 3*a\u2089 is 88572.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers when I first did it. Let me recount the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first (1 + 3(...) is layer 1\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...) is layer 2\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 9\n\nTherefore, there are nine layers, so a\u2081 to a\u2089, with a\u2089 = 29524, and the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I only went up to a\u2088 = 9841 and then thought the result was 3*a\u2088 = 29523. That must have been a mistake in counting the layers. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the formula for a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Since each term is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a\u2099^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a\u2099 = a\u2099^h + a\u2099^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a\u2081 is the innermost term, which is (1 + 3) = 4. However, in the standard recurrence, we usually have a\u2080 as the initial term. Let me adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the sequence starting from n=0. Let me redefine the problem as a\u2080 = 4, and the recurrence is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 for n \u2265 1.\n\nThen, using the general solution a\u2099 = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a\u2080 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a\u2099 = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a\u2099 = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = (9*3^1 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, a\u2082 = (9*3^2 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, a\u2099 = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9:\n\na\u2089 = (9*3^9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19683.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (9*19683 - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nWait, that doesn't match our earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the indexing.\n\nWait, earlier, when I computed a\u2089, I got 29524, but according to this formula, a\u2089 = 88573. That's a discrepancy. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the indexing started at n=0, while in our problem, the innermost term is a\u2081 = 4, which would correspond to n=1 in the formula. Let me check.\n\nIf I consider a\u2081 = 4, then using the formula a\u2081 = (9*3^1 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is correct because a\u2081 = 13, but in our problem, a\u2081 is 4. So, perhaps my indexing is off.\n\nWait, maybe the formula applies when we start with a\u2080 = 4, and then a\u2081 = 13, a\u2082 = 40, etc. So, in our problem, the innermost term is a\u2080 = 4, then a\u2081 = 13, a\u2082 = 40, up to a\u2088 = 29524, which would correspond to n=8.\n\nThus, the formula would give a\u2099 = (9*3^n - 1)/2, so for n=8:\n\na\u2088 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^8 = 6561.\n\nSo, a\u2088 = (9*6561 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation. So, a\u2088 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a\u2089 would be (9*3^9 - 1)/2 = (9*19683 - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573, which is one more than our result. So, perhaps the formula is for n layers starting from a\u2080 = 4, so our problem has nine layers, which would be a\u2089 = 88573, but that contradicts our earlier step-by-step calculation where a\u2088 = 29524.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how we're indexing the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the original problem, the innermost term is (1 + 3) = 4, which we can consider as a\u2081 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built by adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 40, and so on, up to a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, when starting from a\u2080 = 4, a\u2099 = (9*3^n - 1)/2, so for n=8, a\u2088 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2 = 29524, and then the expression is 3*a\u2088 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, perhaps the formula is correct, and the confusion was in the indexing. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought I was getting 29523, I must have miscounted the layers, stopping at a\u2088 = 9841, which is incorrect because a\u2088 should be 29524.\n\nWait, no, let me check again:\n\nWait, in my earlier step-by-step calculation, I had:\n\n1. a\u2081 = 4\n2. a\u2082 = 13\n3. a\u2083 = 40\n4. a\u2084 = 121\n5. a\u2085 = 364\n6. a\u2086 = 1093\n7. a\u2087 = 3280\n8. a\u2088 = 9841\n9. a\u2089 = 29524\n\nWait, so a\u2089 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I was computing up to a\u2088 and getting 9841, but that's not the case. The correct a\u2088 is 9841, but a\u2089 is 29524. So, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nThe recurrence is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis can be rewritten as a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 1.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is a\u2099 = (9*3^n - 1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a\u2089 = (9*3^9 - 1)/2 = (9*19683 - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nWait, that's different from our earlier calculation. Wait, this suggests a\u2089 = 88573, but when we computed step-by-step, a\u2089 was 29524. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the indices. Let me check again.\n\nIf a\u2080 = 4, then a\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\u2080 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, so if a\u2080 = 4, then a\u2089 = 88573. But in our problem, the innermost term is a\u2081 = 4, so perhaps the formula is shifted by one.\n\nWait, perhaps in the problem, a\u2081 corresponds to a\u2080 in the formula. So, a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 13, which would correspond to a\u2081 in the formula. Then, a\u2089 in the problem would correspond to a\u2088 in the formula, which is 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So, the formula gives a\u2099 = (9*3^n - 1)/2, where n starts at 0. In our problem, the innermost term is a\u2081 = 4, which is a\u2080 in the formula. Therefore, when we compute a\u2089 in the problem, it's equivalent to a\u2088 in the formula.\n\nThus, a\u2088 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2 = (9*6561 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this by computing each a\u2099 step by step again, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. a\u2081 = (1 + 3) = 4\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect because in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a\u2089), where a\u2089 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step calculation, I thought the final result was 29523, which was 3*a\u2088, but that must have been a mistake in counting the layers. The correct number of layers is nine, so the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nIn summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and applying the recurrence relation, I've determined that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of (1 + 3(...)). By simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we find the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Innermost Expression**:\n   - Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Apply Recurrence Relation**:\n   - Each layer is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4.\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - a\u2081 = 4\n   - a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Layer**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times the 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the left, the first term is 3 times (1 + ...), and inside that, there's another 3 times (1 + ...), and this continues. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: Each time there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3s. There's one at the beginning, and then each layer adds another. So, let's see: The first is 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, let's see: The innermost part is 1 + 3, then that's inside another 1 + 3*(innermost), and so on, until we reach the outermost 3(...). Let me try to count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is the last part: (1 + 3). Then moving outward, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me write them out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply by 3. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, each layer adds another 3*(...), so the number of layers is 9? Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost before the initial 3. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, if I compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, then multiply by 3, that should give me the final answer.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step to keep track:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, yes.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.\n\nNow, let's add those up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of parentheses, I think there are nine sets of parentheses here. Let me check: Starting from the left, each set is 1 + 3(...), so that's nine times. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me number them from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. So, layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result of layer 1), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost, multiplied by 3. So, let's start with layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result of layer 1). Since layer 1 is 4, layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, layer 2 is 13. Moving on to layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result of layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result of layer 4). 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. So, layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result of layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result of layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result of layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(result of layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1 + 3( ... ), that's another layer. Let me count them: 1. The innermost is (1 + 3) 2. Then the next layer is (1 + 3( ... )) where the ... is the first layer 3. Then another layer, and so on. Hmm, I think there are nine layers here because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 seems to add another layer, and I count nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, actually, let me check that again. Starting from the innermost, the first innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. Let me count from the inside: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(...)) where the ... is the first layer 3. Then another layer, and so on until the ninth layer. So, nine layers in total. That means I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Okay, let's start with the innermost layer. Layer 1: (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let's calculate that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Wait, actually, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I can do 3*29524 directly. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many times this nesting happens. I can see that each time, the expression inside is another 1 + 3(...), and it seems like it's repeated multiple times. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first one, it's 1 + 3(...), then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...)) 2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) 3. And another one. Hmm, actually, let me just count the number of 3s. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by a term, which is 1 plus another 3 times something. Let me see, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, computing each layer step by step. That seems manageable. Let me try that. So, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing outward, next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nMoving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, let me check that again because 3*9841. Maybe I should compute it differently. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3 = 240000, 8000*3 = 24000, 500*3 = 1500, 70*3 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding these together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 = 265500, plus 210 = 265710, plus 9 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, let me verify that 3*88573 is indeed 265719. Let's compute 88573*3 step by step. 80000*3 = 240000, 8000*3 = 24000, 500*3 = 1500, 70*3 = 210, 3*3 = 9. So, adding 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3 = 600000, 60000*3 = 180000, 5000*3 = 15000, 700*3 = 2100, 20*3 = 60. Wait, no, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So, 200000*3 = 600000, 60000*3 = 180000, 5000*3 = 15000, 700*3 = 2100, 20*3 = 60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 = 795000, plus 2100 = 797100, plus 60 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*265720. Let me compute it differently. 265720 * 3: 200000*3 = 600000, 60000*3 = 180000, 5000*3 = 15000, 700*3 = 2100, 20*3 = 60. Adding them: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, +15000 = 795000, +2100 = 797100, +60 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. That's correct.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer, which is 3*(previous result). So, 3*797161. Let me compute that. 700000*3 = 2100000, 90000*3 = 270000, 7000*3 = 21000, 100*3 = 300, 60*3 = 180, 1*3 = 3. Wait, actually, 797161 is 700000 + 90000 + 7000 + 100 + 60 + 1. So, 700000*3 = 2,100,000, 90,000*3 = 270,000, 7,000*3 = 21,000, 100*3 = 300, 60*3 = 180, 1*3 = 3. Adding all these together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000, plus 21,000 = 2,391,000, plus 300 = 2,391,300, plus 180 = 2,391,480, plus 3 = 2,391,483.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 797,161 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n797,161\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n1*3 = 3\n6*3 = 18, carryover 1\n1*3 = 3 + 1 (carryover) = 4\n7*3 = 21, carryover 2\n9*3 = 27 + 2 (carryover) = 29, carryover 2\n7*3 = 21 + 2 (carryover) = 23.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n3\n18 (write 8, carryover 1)\n3 +1 =4\n21 (write 1, carryover 2)\n27 +2 =29 (write 9, carryover 2)\n21 +2 =23.\n\nSo, the result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, that's 2,391,483. Hmm, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 2,391,483 as well, so that's consistent. So, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when I do digit-by-digit multiplication, I might make a mistake. Let me try another approach. Let's break down 797,161 into 700,000 + 97,161. So, 700,000*3 = 2,100,000. Then, 97,161*3. Let's compute 97,161*3:\n\n97,161 * 3:\n90,000*3 = 270,000\n7,000*3 = 21,000\n100*3 = 300\n60*3 = 180\n1*3 = 3\nAdding those together: 270,000 + 21,000 = 291,000, +300 = 291,300, +180 = 291,480, +3 = 291,483.\n\nThen, adding 2,100,000 + 291,483 = 2,391,483. That's the same result as before. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me count how many layers I had to compute. Starting from the innermost, I did 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer. Let me recount to make sure I didn't skip any steps or compute an extra one.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n13. Then, the outermost 3*797161 = 2,391,483.\n\nWait, so that's 12 layers inside, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then the final multiplication by 3. So, 12 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the final 3*(...). Let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers.\n\nThe original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is enclosed in another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time you see 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Continuing outward, each time adding another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, the number of layers increases by one. So, the innermost is 1 layer, then 2, up to how many?\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of 1+3(...) inside is 9. Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so how many times does that happen? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on. So, the number of layers is 9. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n3. Another: 3(1+3(...))\n4. Then: 3(1+3(...))\n5. Next: 3(1+3(...))\n6. Then: 3(1+3(...))\n7. Next: 3(1+3(...))\n8. Then: 3(1+3(...))\n9. Finally: 3(1+3(...)) which is 1+3.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous one. So, when I was computing earlier, I went through 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then finally multiplied by 3. But in my earlier steps, I ended up with 12 layers. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me list each step again, carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*(265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. Finally, the outermost 3*(797161) = 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but according to the original problem, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, why did I end up with 9 layers leading to 797,161, and then the final multiplication by 3? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous one. So, when I computed up to 797,161, that was after 9 layers, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, my steps were correct, and the final result is 3*797,161 = 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is enclosed in parentheses, so the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is equal to the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. So, that's 9 layers, meaning I have to compute 9 times 1 + 3*(previous result). So, my computation up to 9 layers leading to 797,161, and then the final multiplication by 3, giving 2,391,483, is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that compute?\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, expanding the entire expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, that works. Now, let's try another small example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Compute this.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThat works too. So, my approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, after computing 9 layers, I reach 797,161, and then multiply by 3 to get 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computation at each step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. It's easy to make a mistake when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\n11. 1 + 3*88573. 3*88573: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. 240000+24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n\n12. 1 + 3*265720. 3*265720: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. 600000+180000=780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. 1 + 797160 = 797161. Correct.\n\n13. Finally, 3*797161. As computed earlier, 797161*3=2,391,483. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out. Therefore, the final result is indeed 2,391,483.\n\nI think I've carefully worked through each step, double-checking my arithmetic each time, and each step seems correct. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3( ... ). Let me see, starting from the inside: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of step 1) 3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of step 2) And so on, until we've gone through all the layers. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, and each layer has one more 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, that's the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the parentheses. 1. 1+3 2. 1+3(...) 3. 1+3(...) 4. 1+3(...) 5. 1+3(...) 6. 1+3(...) 7. 1+3(...) 8. 1+3(...) 9. 1+3(...)) 10. 1+3(...)) So, actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...) inside each other, starting from the innermost. Wait, let me check that again. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(...)) and inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on. So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, to compute this, I need to start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards. That is, compute the innermost expression first, then use that result in the next outer layer, and so on until I reach the outermost layer. Let's try that approach. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3 = 360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.

Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each being 1 plus three times the next inner layer. By calculating each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many nested expressions there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that result is used in the next layer, and so on. I think there are nine layers here because each time I see a 1+3 inside another set of parentheses, and it repeats until the end. Let me check: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that is inside another 1+3(...), and so on, up to nine times. Hmm, maybe nine layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3 times (1 + ...). Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then that is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and so on. So, perhaps it's a recursive structure where each layer depends on the previous one. To avoid confusion, I think the best approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. That way, I can keep track of each intermediate result and build up the solution. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers of nesting. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go back and check each layer again.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572. So yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, just to confirm.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: this looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the nth term can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let's see: Let me try to find a pattern in the a_n values:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each a_n seems to be 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 =4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: (3/2)*3^n = (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nThen, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n- Layer 4: 121\n- Layer 5: 364\n- Layer 6: 1093\n- Layer 7: 3280\n- Layer 8: 9841\n- Layer 9: 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). The something is another similar expression, but each time, the innermost part is just 1 + 3, right? Let me check: starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, we have 3 multiplied by that 4. So, 3 * 4 is 12. Let me write that down. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3), which is 3*(4) = 12. Then, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 12) because the expression becomes 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 12 is 13, and then 3*13 is 39. Wait, no, that seems off. Let me try again, maybe I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to label each layer as I go outwards. Let me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say the innermost parentheses is layer 1, then each layer moving outward is layer 2, 3, etc., up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Layer 4: 3*(1 + layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Layer 5: 3*(1 + layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Layer 6: 3*(1 + layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Layer 7: 3*(1 + layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Layer 8: 3*(1 + layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Layer 9: 3*(1 + layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Wait, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each 3*(...) is a layer. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, that's (1+3). Then, each time, we have 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to one set of parentheses. So, perhaps my earlier calculation is correct, leading to 36084 as the final result. But let me verify each step carefully because it's easy to make a mistake in such a nested structure. Let me list each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, so according to this, the final result is 36084. But wait, let me check each multiplication step again to be sure I didn't make a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Let me check 1336*3: 1300*3=3900, 36*3=108, so 3900+108=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Now, 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out. Therefore, the final result is 36084. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3, starting from the innermost term. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Similarly, a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 48, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved, perhaps, to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's compute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084.\n\nI can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3, but let me check: 4*3 = 12, but a_2 is 15, which is 12 + 3. Similarly, 15*3=45, a_3 is 48, which is 45 + 3. 48*3=144, a_4 is 147, which is 144 +3. Hmm, so it seems that a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2.\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this: 3^n is the same as 3*3^{n-1}, so perhaps we can write it differently, but let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683: Let's compute 19683 \u00f7 6 first. 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5. Then, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280 *11 = 36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nJust to make sure, I can compute one more layer using the formula. Let's compute a_3 using the formula.\n\na_3 = (11/6)*3^3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2.\n\n27 \u00f7 6 = 4.5, 4.5 * 11 = 49.5. Then, 49.5 - 1.5 = 48, which matches the earlier result. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final result is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n7.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, each containing 1 + 3(...). So, it's like 3 levels deep nine times. Wait, no, actually, each opening parenthesis is a new level, so let me count the number of nested expressions. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I have nine sets of parentheses, that means there are nine levels of nesting. Let me write them out one by one to clarify.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nAnd this continues until Level 9, and then finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each level step by step, starting from Level 1 up to Level 9, and then multiply the result by 3. Let's try that.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nAlright, moving on to Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nHmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous level's result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next level. Let's keep going.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Level 9 gives me 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, I need to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 multiplied by 3.\n\nFirst, 3 * 4 = 12. Write down 2 and carry over 1.\nNext, 3 * 2 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\nThen, 3 * 5 = 15. Write down 5 and carry over 1.\nNext, 3 * 9 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8 and carry over 2.\nFinally, 3 * 2 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, putting it all together, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Maybe I can add 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n- 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 4 + 2 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 0 + 5 = 5, write down 5.\n- 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n- 5 + 2 = 7, plus 1 is 8, write down 8.\n- 5 + nothing = 5, write down 5.\n\nWait, actually, let me write it out properly:\n\n      29524\n    +29524\n    +29524\n    -------\nStarting from the right:\n4 + 4 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n5 + 5 + 5 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry 0.\nThere's a 2 in the ten-thousands place with nothing else, so write 2.\n\nSo, adding them up gives 88572. That matches my earlier result. Good, so 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my levels. Sometimes when you have multiple nested operations, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step.\n\nStarting from Level 1 to Level 9:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each of these steps seems accurate.\n\nLet me verify Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all levels are correctly calculated. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any addition errors in the levels. Let's recompute a couple of them.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, all levels check out. So, the final multiplication by 3 is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each level is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. If I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nYes, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n-1} when r \u2260 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, r = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrence relations. The solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, plugging in c = 1 and r = 3:\n\na_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1}\n= (1)/(-2) + (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1}\n= -1/2 + (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1}\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's compute the constant term:\n\na_n = -1/2 + (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1}\n= -1/2 + (9/2) * 3^{n-1}\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = -1/2 + (9/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nLet me test this formula with n = 1:\n\na_1 = -1/2 + (9/2)*3^{0} = -1/2 + (9/2)*1 = (-1 + 9)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2:\n\na_2 = -1/2 + (9/2)*3^{1} = -1/2 + (9/2)*3 = -1/2 + 27/2 = ( -1 + 27 ) / 2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3:\n\na_3 = -1/2 + (9/2)*3^{2} = -1/2 + (9/2)*9 = -1/2 + 81/2 = ( -1 + 81 ) / 2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4:\n\na_4 = -1/2 + (9/2)*3^{3} = -1/2 + (9/2)*27 = -1/2 + 243/2 = ( -1 + 243 ) / 2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold for the first few levels. So, for Level 9, which is n = 9:\n\na_9 = -1/2 + (9/2)*3^{8}\n\nCompute 3^8 first. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = -1/2 + (9/2)*6561\n\nCompute (9/2)*6561:\n\nFirst, 9*6561. Let's compute that:\n\n6561 * 9:\n6000*9 = 54000\n500*9 = 4500\n60*9 = 540\n1*9 = 9\nAdding them up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049.\n\nSo, 9*6561 = 59049.\n\nThen, (9/2)*6561 = 59049 / 2 = 29524.5\n\nSo, a_9 = -1/2 + 29524.5 = (-0.5 + 29524.5) = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods\u2014computing step by step and using the recurrence relation formula\u2014lead to the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) manually, starting from the innermost parentheses, to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, same result. So, it's consistent across different methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach confirm the same result. So, I think I've solved the problem correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\) and each subsequent level is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each level:\n   - Level 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Level 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Level 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Level 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Level 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Level 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Level 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Level 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Level 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n   - \\( 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
