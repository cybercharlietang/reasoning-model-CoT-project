    "text": " \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of 3s, I think there are nine 3s multiplied by terms, each of which is 1 plus something. So maybe there are eight nested expressions inside? Hmm, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: starting from the left, the first parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent 3 has another parenthesis. Wait, actually, each 3 is followed by a parenthesis, so maybe there are nine sets of parentheses. That might mean that the innermost expression is the last (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3 times something. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the last part of the expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, it would be 3 * 4, which is 12. Then, that 12 is inside another set of parentheses: 1 + 12. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after each 3, I see that each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, so starting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(...)) \n\nSo, each 3 is followed by a parenthesis, so the number of 3s is 9, meaning there are 9 layers of multiplication by 3. Therefore, each layer is built upon the previous one, starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try again, this time carefully, layer by layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet's denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3 * Layer 1 = 3 * 4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3 * Layer 3 = 3 * 13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3 * Layer 5 = 3 * 40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3 * Layer 7 = 3 * 121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 364 = 1092\n\nWait, but the original expression is only 9 layers deep, right? Let me check the structure again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, each 3 is followed by a parenthesis, so there are 9 instances of 3 followed by a parenthesis, which would imply 9 layers of multiplication. But when I evaluated, I ended up with 10 layers. Hmm, perhaps I need to recount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, but in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each time adding a new layer outward.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as a recursive expression. Let me try to define it recursively. Let me denote E(n) as the expression with n layers. So, E(1) = (1 + 3). Then E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then the next layer out is 1 + 3*(innermost). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have n layers, then E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, let me compute E(1) to E(9), since the original expression has 9 layers of multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE(4) = 1 + 3*E(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE(5) = 1 + 3*E(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE(6) = 1 + 3*E(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*E(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE(8) = 1 + 3*E(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE(9) = 1 + 3*E(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E(9)), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the 9th layer.\n\nWait, let me check the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression, which is E(9). So, after computing E(9) = 29524, the total expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, E(9) is 29524, so 3*29524 would be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this because I might have made a mistake in the recursive approach. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me go back.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the layers would be as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of it as E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1)=4, then E(9)=29524, and the total expression is 3*E(9)=88572.\n\nBut let me check this because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it by expanding the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n3*(innermost) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 12) = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 3*13 = 39.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 39) = 40.\n\nNext layer: 3*40 = 120.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 120) = 121.\n\nNext layer: 3*121 = 363.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 363) = 364.\n\nNext layer: 3*364 = 1092.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 1092) = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 3*1093 = 3279.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3279) = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 3*3280 = 9840.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 9840) = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 29523) = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3 is multiplied by this: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting a different result because I'm counting more layers. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer adds a new 1 + 3*... So, starting from 4, each step is 1 + 3*(previous).\n\nSo, let me list each step:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer would be 88572.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me go through each step carefully:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the layers were 9, but when I listed them, I had 9 steps after the innermost, leading to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try another approach: perhaps using the formula for a geometric series or recognizing a pattern.\n\nEach layer is of the form E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nE(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1)\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, E(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, E(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result I got earlier. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense now. I might have overcomplicated it at first, but breaking it down step by step and then using the recurrence relation helped solidify the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next innermost layer. After evaluating each layer step by step, the final result is found by multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Work Outward Layer by Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the outermost 3 by the result of Layer 9: 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It's 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times ... and so on, until the innermost part is just 1 plus 3). Hmm, so maybe each step involves computing a term that's 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me try to parse this from the inside out. The innermost part is 1+3. Let's compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that part is 13. Now, moving another step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we have 40. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*121. So, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, so now we're at 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Wow, that's getting big. Next layer out: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Okay, so now we have 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's see: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Wow, that's a pretty large number. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... wait, let me compute 3*9524 step by step. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So, adding those together: 27000 + 1500 is 28500, plus 72 is 28572. Now, adding that to the 60000: 60000 + 28572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, now we've computed the innermost part all the way out to the outermost parentheses, and the result is 88573. But wait, the original expression is 3 times that entire nested expression. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 88573. Let me compute that: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 equals 265,719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 1+3*40=121. Then, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Then, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. Then, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 1+3*29524=88573. Then, 3*88573=265,719. Yep, that seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly, so I'm confident that the final answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part becomes 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next level is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nSo now, that part simplifies to 13. The next level out is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. \n\nWait, hold on, so each time I go out a level, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me check that again. \n\nYes, so each expression is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result).

Let me define a sequence a_n where n is the level, starting from the innermost as a_1. \n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. \n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. \n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. \n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. \n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. \n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. \n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. \n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. \n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. \n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. \n\nWait, hold on, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count again to make sure. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each 1+3(...) is one level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and each time it repeats. Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...). \n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) \n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3). \n\nSo, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, we have a new (1+3(...)). Let me see: \n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first (1+3(...) is level 1. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)) is level 2, and so on until the innermost. So, how many levels? Let's see: \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)) inside each other: \n\n1. The first one: 3(1+3(...)) \n2. Inside that: 3(1+3(...)) \n3. Continuing... up to the innermost. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me look at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new level. Let's see:\n\n- After the first 3, we have 1+3(...\n- Then inside that, another 1+3(...\n- Continuing until we reach the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then 1+3(...\n3. Then 1+3(...\n4. Then 1+3(...\n5. Then 1+3(...\n6. Then 1+3(...\n7. Then 1+3(...\n8. Then 1+3(...\n9. Then 1+3(... \n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, there are 9 levels of nesting. So, the innermost is level 9, then each level above is 8, 7, etc., up to level 1, which is the outermost. \n\nBut when I was computing earlier, I went up to a_10, which would be level 10, but the expression only has 9 levels. So, perhaps I overcounted. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I should index the levels differently. Let me think: the innermost is level 1, then each level above is level 2, up to level 9, which is the outermost. So, in that case, the innermost is 1+3, which is level 1: 4. Then level 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, level 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to level 9. \n\nSo, I need to compute up to level 9. Let me redo that.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) where a_9 is 29524. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. \n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, but wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Let me break it down:\n\n3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24\n\nCompute each part:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might miscompute a value.\n\nLet me go back through the levels again:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. In this case, each level is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is k - r = 0, so k = r. In this case, r=3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (c=1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds true for each level. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for a_n.\n\nBut regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, those exponents are correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is indeed 177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divide by 2 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each level is tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant. However, since we've already derived a closed-form formula and verified it with multiple methods, I think we're good.\n\nSo, in summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each level step by step, and then verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus three times the next nested term. By systematically evaluating each level from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each level follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula and compute the final result step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is nested with each term being \\(1 + 3(\\text{next term})\\). There are 9 levels of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Proceed Outward:**\n   - Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

That is, starting from the innermost, there's a 1+3, then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next expression. Maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression or find a pattern by expanding each layer one by one. Let me try expanding it step by step, starting from the innermost part.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, ..., Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. So Level 1 is 1 + 3. Then Level 2 is 1 + 3(Level 1), and so on, up to Level 9, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3(Level 9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times (something), so the outermost is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So maybe the levels are from the inside out, starting with the innermost 1 + 3. Let me try to compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me break this down: 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in one of the levels. Let me go back step by step to verify each level.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n- Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n- Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nWait, no, wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n\n5*3 =15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the digit places. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d73 can be computed as:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the structure, each level seems to be 1 + 3*(previous level). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, etc., each time it's 1 + 3 times the previous. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern in the numbers I got:\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each level is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, Level n = 1 + 3*Level(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Level n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for Level n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation:\n\nLevel n = 1 + 3*Level(n-1)\n\nWith Level 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is Level_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Level_p(n) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\nLevel(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition Level(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is:\n\nLevel(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Level(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with Level 1:\n\nLevel(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Level(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 levels, Level 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo Level 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Level9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, Level9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each step builds on the previous one, and the closed-form formula confirms that. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by a sum of 1 and another expression. By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each level follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value at each level efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way up to the outermost layer, finally multiplying by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each level n is defined as Level(n) = 1 + 3*Level(n-1), starting with Level(1) = 4.\n\n3. **Closed-form Formula**: Solving the recurrence relation gives Level(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Level 9**: Since there are 9 layers, compute Level(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Final Expression**: Multiply Level(9) by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the very last (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so now we have 40. Let's go another layer out. It's 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that.\n\n3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding these: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because 3*29524 is actually 88572, yes, and adding 1 gives 88573. Hmm, okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nCompute 3*88573: Let me do this step by step. 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding these together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*265720.\n\nCompute 3*265720: 3*200000 = 600000, 3*60000 = 180000, 3*5000 = 15000, 3*700 = 2100, 3*20 = 60. Adding these: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result: 3*797161.\n\nCompute 3*797161: Let's break it down. 3*700000 = 2100000, 3*90000 = 270000, 3*7000 = 21000, 3*100 = 300, 3*60 = 180, 3*1 = 3. Adding these: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 3*797161 should be computed correctly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the previous step where I calculated 1 + 3*265720. Let me go back and verify each step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. 3*797161 = 2391483\n\nWait, so according to this, the final result is 2,391,483. But I feel like that might be too large. Let me check each step again to see if I made any miscalculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364: 3*364. Let's compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 1 + 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+72=88572. 1+88572=88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n11. 1 + 3*88573: 3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9. 240000+24000=264000+1500=265500+210=265710+9=265719. 1+265719=265720 \u2714\ufe0f\n12. 1 + 3*265720: 3*200000=600000, 3*60000=180000, 3*5000=15000, 3*700=2100, 3*20=60. 600000+180000=780000+15000=795000+2100=797100+60=797160. 1+797160=797161 \u2714\ufe0f\n13. Finally, 3*797161: Let's compute this carefully. 797161 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 797,161 * 3:\n\n- 700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n- 90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n- 7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n- 100 * 3 = 300\n- 60 * 3 = 180\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161 = 2,391,483.\n\nWait a minute, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 2,391,483. Hmm, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier, let me recount the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. Wait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside each other. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n- Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the second layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n- The third layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n- And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, in the given expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3). Then, each layer wraps around, so we have 9 layers to compute. Therefore, in my earlier steps, I computed up to the 9th layer, resulting in 797,161, and then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but when I started, I thought the innermost was the first layer, but now I see that the innermost is the 9th layer, so I actually computed 9 layers, each time moving out, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous), which is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had a_9 as 29524, but when I continued, I had more layers. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, each layer adds one more. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to a_9 = 29524, but then continued computing beyond that, which would imply more than 9 layers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the expression has 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\" starting from the innermost.\n\nTherefore, the computation should be:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, I think I miscounted the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", starting from the innermost. So, each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step out, until I reach the 9th layer, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, in my earlier computation, I went beyond 9 layers, which was incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute 9 layers, resulting in 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(previous result). So, for 9 layers, we compute up to layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(layer 8 result).\n\nLet me list them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, my earlier mistake was that I continued beyond 9 layers, thinking there were more, but actually, the expression only has 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", so the computation stops at layer 9, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct result should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3). Then, each layer wraps around, so we compute 9 layers, resulting in 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went beyond 9 layers, which was incorrect. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by computing each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was thinking there were more layers than there actually are. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute it again step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By carefully evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I'll start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and then work my way outwards. Let me number each layer to keep track:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1 result) + 1\nWait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 9: (1 + 3)\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd so on, up to Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). Hmm, maybe I should count how many layers there are. Let's see, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Let me check:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The innermost is (1+3)\n   - Then each step out adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final 3*. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that:\n\nYes, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), so if there are nine layers inside, then the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, I'll need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time using the result from the previous layer. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7.\n\n524 * 3 = 1572, plus the carried 7 is 1579. So, write down 9, carry over 7.\n\n952 * 3 = 2856, plus 7 is 2863. Write down 3, carry over 6.\n\n29 * 3 = 87, plus 6 is 93. Write down 3, carry over 9.\n\nFinally, 0 (since there's nothing left) plus 9 is 9.\n\nWait, maybe I should do it more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, so 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the result of the next layer. After computing all nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by three.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The outermost layer is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). That something is another 1 + 3 times another expression, and this repeats several times. I think the key here is to compute each innermost part first and then work my way outwards. So, maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and then substitute that value back into the next layer, and so on. Let me try to map this out.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine layers of parentheses. That means I need to compute from the 9th layer up to the first layer. Let me try to write each layer as an expression, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). Hmm, so the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, to compute this, I need to compute L1 through L9, starting from L1.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to L2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4: 12\n\nSo, L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39\n\nSo, L3 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext, L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 120\n\nSo, L4 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nProceeding to L5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 363\n\nSo, L5 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMoving on to L6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092\n\nSo, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext, L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279\n\nSo, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nMoving on to L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840\n\nSo, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down.\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an error with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute it again step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, my approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be straightforward. However, just to check, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me consider the general form of such an expression. Suppose we have n layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, for n layers, the value would be... Hmm, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the nth term of this sequence can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug this into the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight-hand side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified my work. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

Finally, compute the outermost expression:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me compute that first. \n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, let me compute that. \n\nStep 2: The next level is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now that part simplifies to 13. Let me replace that part in the original expression. So now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*13. First, 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so that simplifies to 40. Let me go another level out. The next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, so that becomes 121. Moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Let me calculate that.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, now we have 364. Let me continue moving outward. The next part is 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's a big number. So, now that simplifies to 1093. Moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me work that out.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let me compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nAlright, so that becomes 3280. Let me go another level out. The next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, that's 9841. Moving out another level, the next part is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate this.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWow, that's a huge number. So, now we have 29524. Let me go to the next level out. The expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524: Let me compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nSo, that simplifies to 88573. Moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 11: 1 + 3*88573. 3*88573: Let me compute this step by step. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Now, adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nSo, now we have 265720. Let me go another level out. The expression is 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 12: 1 + 3*265720. 3*265720: Let me break it down. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So, 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Now, adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, 780000 + 15000 = 795000, 795000 + 2100 = 797100, 797100 + 60 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nSo, that's 797161. Now, moving out to the outermost parentheses, the expression is 3*(797161). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 13: 3*797161. Let me compute this carefully. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Wait, actually, 797161 is 700000 + 90000 + 7000 + 100 + 60 + 1. So, 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Now, adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000, 2391000 + 300 = 2391300, 2391300 + 180 = 2391480, 2391480 + 3 = 2391483.\n\nSo, 3*797161 = 2391483.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2391483. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3)=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573, 1+3*88573=265720, 1+3*265720=797161, and finally 3*797161=2391483.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step, I computed the innermost parentheses first and worked my way out, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. Each time, the numbers got bigger, but the operations were straightforward. I think I did each multiplication correctly, breaking them down into manageable parts and adding step by step. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final result is 2,391,483.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{2391483}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

Substitute and compute the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Substitute and compute the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8.

Finally, compute the outermost expression:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 797161 = 2391483 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{2391483}\\)."

Starting from the left, each time I see a 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis seems to add another layer, so let me count them:\n\n1. The first layer is 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost part.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should count how many times 3 is multiplied in each layer. Let me try to parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1+3\n\nThen, moving outward: 1+3*(innermost result)\n\nThen the next layer: 1+3*(previous result)\n\nAnd this repeats until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute this by starting at the innermost part and working my way out, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost expression:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, no, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That's correct. Hmm, okay.\n\nProceeding to the next layer:\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems right.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3:\n\nFinal result: 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, right?\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, let me do it another way to confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous). How many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3s after each parenthesis: Let me count the number of \"1+3(\".\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we have 1+3*(...). Let's count how many times we have 1+3(...):\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\".\n\nLooking at the expression: Each time you see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n...\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to see that each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer. So, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1+3*(...), and so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 = 4 (Layer1)\n\nThen, 1+3*4 =13 (Layer2)\n\nThen, 1+3*13=40 (Layer3)\n\nThen, 1+3*40=121 (Layer4)\n\nThen, 1+3*121=364 (Layer5)\n\nThen, 1+3*364=1093 (Layer6)\n\nThen, 1+3*1093=3280 (Layer7)\n\nThen, 1+3*3280=9841 (Layer8)\n\nThen, 1+3*9841=29524 (Layer9)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers in total, right? From Layer1 to Layer9.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the number of opening parentheses is 9, right?\n\nWait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first parenthesis after 3 is the start of the innermost expression, and each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, that would correspond to 9 layers, which is what I did earlier, from L1 to L9. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. I think I did this correctly. Each step seems logical, and I didn't see any calculation errors upon reviewing. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, let me denote each step as I go. Let me define each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, Level 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1).

So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses, which is Level 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, after computing Level 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe another way to compute 3*29524 is:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check each Level again to ensure I didn't make any errors in the earlier steps. Let's go through each Level once more.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*29524, which we calculated as 88572. Let me just confirm that multiplication once again.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreaking it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 8 8 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that seems different. Wait, let me do it again:\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 + 1=7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 + 1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 + 2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 7 5 7 2? Wait, that's 887572? No, wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the Levels, let me recount them:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Level 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3 times the Level 9 result. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something, but since I already have the step-by-step result, maybe it's not necessary. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's a formula that can represent this.\n\nEach Level seems to be of the form: Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1). So, starting from Level 1 = 4, Level 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, each Level is 1 + 3 times the previous Level.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence, and perhaps it can be represented as Level n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 1? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, let's see: Let's model Level n as a function of n.\n\nLevel 1: 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nHmm, let's see if there's a pattern or formula here. Each Level seems to be following Level n = (3^n + 1)/2. Wait, let me test that.\n\nFor Level 1: n=1. (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. But Level 1 is 4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe Level n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes! Level n is equal to (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Level 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, which is 29524, as we found earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that formula. So, Level n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me see if that's accurate.\n\nLooking at the recursion: Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1).\n\nSo, Level n = 1 + 3*Level n-1.\n\nIf we let Level n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then:\n\nLevel n = 1 + 3*( (3^n -1)/2 )\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*( (3^n -1)/2 ) = 1 + (3^(n+1) -3)/2.\n\nWhich is equal to (2 + 3^(n+1) -3)/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, which matches Level n. So, yes, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, Level 9 is (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the formula is correctly applied. Since Level 1 corresponds to n=1, and the formula gives (3^(1+1)-1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 4, which is correct. So, the formula works for each Level.\n\nTherefore, Level 9 is (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\n1. Identify that the expression is a nested structure with 9 levels.\n2. Compute each level starting from the innermost (Level 1) to the outermost (Level 9).\n3. Each Level n is 1 + 3*(Level n-1).\n4. After computing each Level, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9).\n5. Using the recursive formula, we find that Level n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n6. Therefore, Level 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n7. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations or the reasoning. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Level 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1+3), right? Let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a (1 + something). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the first 3, I see that each subsequent 3 is followed by another (1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the left, each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s. I think there are nine 3s in total, each followed by a (1 + ...). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me see: \n\nThe outermost 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), and so on. So, each layer adds another 3 and another (1 + ...). Let me count the number of layers. \n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. Continuing this way, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. From the expression, each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- The second 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- This continues until the ninth 3, which is followed by (1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost part is (1 + 3), without another 3 after it. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nI can see that each layer adds another 3 and another (1 + ...). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then the next 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n3. This continues until the ninth layer, which is just (1 + 3)\n\nSo, there are nine layers in total, each adding another 3 and another (1 + ...). That means I need to compute this expression by starting from the innermost layer and working my way out. That makes sense because each layer depends on the result of the inner layer. \n\nLet me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. I'll write down each step as I go.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, so let me think of it as layers from inside out. Let me number the layers from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12, then Layer 2 expression is (1 + 12) = 13\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me think again. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...), but actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + that result), and so on.\n\nLet me try to structure this properly.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and move outward. Let's define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: The next layer out is 3*(1 + result from Step 1). So, 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me see.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of each layer as being 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) at the very end, then moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), where ... is the result of the next inner layer.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here because the original expression has nine layers, each with a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Wait, but when I counted from the innermost, I had L1 to L9, each being 3*(1 + previous). But in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer), so perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let me list each step correctly.\n\nLet me list the layers as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer9, which is the outermost layer, that would be the final result, right? So, the total value would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 3s in the original expression. Each opening parenthesis after a 3 represents a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...). Let's count how many times 3*(1 + ... occurs.\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), so that's Layer1.\n\nThen moving outward, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ... occurs, which is 9 times because the innermost is the ninth layer. Wait, no, actually, when I count the number of 3s, each followed by (1 + ...), let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s: \n\n- The first 3 is at the very beginning.\n- Then inside that, another 3.\n- This continues until the ninth 3, which is followed by (1 + 3).\n\nWait, no, actually, each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s, which is 9. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that would be the result. But let me check if I did each step correctly, because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each time, I'm adding 1 to the previous layer's result and then multiplying by 3. Let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 4\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because the first term is 4, then each subsequent term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me check if this recurrence can be solved more efficiently.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write down the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na3 = 3*(1 + a2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na4 = 3*(1 + a3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na5 = 3*(1 + a4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na6 = 3*(1 + a5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na7 = 3*(1 + a6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na8 = 3*(1 + a7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na9 = 3*(1 + a8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this recurrence, let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 3\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2K = 3 => K = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = 11/(2*3) = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - (3/2) = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, let's check n=2:\n\na2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (3/2) = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15, which matches.\n\nGood, the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, since we have a9 as the outermost layer, let's compute a9 using this formula.\n\na9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9 first:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo,\n\na9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute:\n\n3280.5 * 10 = 32805\n\n3280.5 * 1 = 3280.5\n\nTotal: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5\n\nSo,\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation. So, a9 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by taking 3*(1 + previous layer). I computed each layer step by step, which took me to the ninth layer, resulting in 36084. Additionally, I derived a general formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation and confirmed that it gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\)\n\nThus, the computed value of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

The something is another 3 multiplied by another (1 plus something else), and this repeats. Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, I see 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3\" is a layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Wait, actually, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1. So perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times this pattern repeats. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3. So that means there are nine layers here. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working my way out to the first layer. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Maybe I can denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost. Let me define L9 as 1 + 3. Then, L8 would be 1 + 3*(L9), L7 would be 1 + 3*(L8), and so on, until L1, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*(L1). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so maybe L1 is the innermost 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) on the outside. Let me try to structure this properly. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n- Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So maybe I should start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so the final result would be 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me check that again. Because in the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So if I have Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer step by step because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 121*3: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me verify using another method. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized something. The problem starts with 3*(...), so the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So I think I correctly calculated each layer, starting from the innermost and moving out. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLet me recheck each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 29523=29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually. Let's take Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct. So yeah, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo yes, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the innermost is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check with n=9 using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me count: starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of layer 1)\n3. Then the next is 1 + 3*(result of layer 2)\n4. Continuing this way, I think there are 9 layers in total because each time it's 1 + 3(...), and the expression is repeated 9 times. Wait, no, let me check again. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe I should count the number of \"1+\" sections. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + ...).

Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Then (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses.

So, how many 3s are there after the initial one? Let's see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nI count 9 instances where 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Wait, no, actually, the initial 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, and then each subsequent 3 inside is also followed by another opening parenthesis. So, perhaps there are 9 layers. Let me check:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer adds another 3*(...), so if I have 9 layers, that would mean 9 times 3*(...). But I think in this case, the number of layers is actually 8. Wait, let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3.

So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the layers correctly. Let me check again because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers because each 3*(...) adds another layer. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))\n\nSo, each time we have a new layer, so let's see:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I have 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(...), then the total number of layers is 9, and the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would make the total value 88572.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the number of layers can be tricky. Let me try a different approach: perhaps writing the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check again. Maybe I should count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost is the 9th.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1 + 3(\", I see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 inside is another layer. So, the first layer is the innermost (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2.\n\nThen Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting the same result as before. So, maybe that's correct. Let me check the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nCorrect.\n\nLayer 2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nCorrect.\n\nLayer 3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nCorrect.\n\nLayer 4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nCorrect.\n\nLayer 5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000=60000.\n\n3*9000=27000.\n\n3*500=1500.\n\n3*24=72.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000.\n\n3*9000=27000.\n\n3*500=1500.\n\n3*24=72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I have 9 layers. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, the count can be off by one. Let me try another approach: perhaps writing out the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm now thinking, maybe I should count the number of times the expression 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, which is the base case.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we add a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...), which in this case is 9 times, including the innermost one.\n\nWait, but the innermost is just 1 + 3, which is 4, without any multiplication by 3 outside. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, computing a_9 gives us 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet's find B.\n\nAssume a_n = B, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n24*3=72, write down 2, carry over 7.\n\n2*3=6 +7=13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n5*3=15 +1=16, write down 6, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 8,7,6,3,2,7,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\) starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   L_2 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13, \\\\\n   L_3 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40, \\\\\n   L_4 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121, \\\\\n   L_5 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364, \\\\\n   L_6 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093, \\\\\n   L_7 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280, \\\\\n   L_8 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841, \\\\\n   L_9 &= 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, compute the outermost expression:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me compute that first. \n\nFirst step: Compute the innermost parentheses.\nSo, starting from the innermost part: (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. \n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, let me check that again. The innermost is the last (1 + 3), so that's the ninth one, right? Let me count the number of 3s to see how deep the nesting goes. Hmm, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that means we have nine layers here. So, starting from the ninth layer, which is the innermost, we compute (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward, each layer will involve multiplying by 3 and adding 1. \n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, we have 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, maybe it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost layer and working our way outwards, computing each layer step by step. \n\nLet me try to outline the layers. Let's number them from inside out as layers 1 to 9. \n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, each layer is actually 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, which is (1 + 3). Let me think of it as Layer 1 being the innermost. Maybe I should index them from the inside out. Let me try to structure this:\n\nDefine each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, right? So, when I compute Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, Layer 3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on until Layer 9, which would be the outermost layer, giving the final result. But wait, the original expression is 3*(...), so does that mean that Layer 9 is the outermost? Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers starting from the innermost as Layer 1 and moving outward, so Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and Layer 9 is the outermost expression. So, each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n+1). Wait, no, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recursive function where each layer depends on the next.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let me think of each term as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe f(n) represents the value of the expression with n layers. So, f(1) would be 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Then, f(2) would be 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, but in the original problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), so f(1) = (1 + 3) = 4, then f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, and so on, as I did before. So, perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, meaning that the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer wraps around it with 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe the total expression is f(9), where f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 4.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. Let me think of the problem as having 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on until the ninth layer. So, in that case, the final answer would be the value after nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 36084, but let me check that again because that seems quite large. Let me go step by step and compute each layer carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so the final result after nine layers is 36084. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420, +24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320 +15=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer's computation seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can approach this problem in a different way, maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + ...)) can sometimes be modeled using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this problem, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the number of layers, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's write it down:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nWith the base case L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, L_1 is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, L_2 = 3*(1 + L_1) = 15, as we computed earlier.\n\nNow, to find a general formula for L_n, perhaps we can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to compute a few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, the pattern is that each term is 3 times (1 + previous term). So, perhaps this is a linear recurrence relation, and we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general form of the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, in our case, it's L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), which can be rewritten as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3.\n\nSo, it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach to solve such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3\n\n-2A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\n11/2 = 3C\n\nC = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplifying, 3^n is 3*3^{n-1}, so we can write:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nBut let's compute this for n = 9 to see if it matches our earlier result.\n\nCompute L_9:\n\nL_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\n3^9 is 19683.\n\nSo, (11/6)*19683 = (11 * 19683)/6\n\nCompute 19683 \u00f7 6: 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36,080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nThen, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nSo, L_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the formula works, and the result is indeed 36,084.\n\nWait a second, but in our initial step-by-step, we had Layer 9 as 36084, which is 36,084, so that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let me check for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 1.5 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 1.5 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for the first few layers, so it's reliable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. For example, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series or recognizing a pattern in the numbers we get. Looking at the numbers we have:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 15\n\nLayer 3: 48\n\nLayer 4: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 6: 1335\n\nLayer 7: 4008\n\nLayer 8: 12027\n\nLayer 9: 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, no, in our case, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's not exactly a geometric progression, but a linear recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express each term as 3^{n} multiplied by some constant plus another term. Wait, from the formula we derived, L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, which can be rewritten as L_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\n(11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, that works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 11*19683 = Let's compute 10*19683=196,830, plus 1*19683=19,683, so total is 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513.\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 \u00f7 6.\n\nCompute 216,504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000.\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504.\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84.\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = 36,084.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer, which is 36,084.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked it step by step, used a recurrence relation, and even derived a formula to compute it directly. All approaches give me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 36,084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Innermost Layer:**\n   The innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   Each layer is computed as 3*(1 + result of the previous layer).\n\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Final Result:**\n   After computing all nine layers, the result is 36,084.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

So, each time, it's 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus another similar term. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outwards. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count: 1. Innermost: (1+3) 2. Next layer: (1+3*(1+3)) 3. Then: (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))) and so on, until the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: the problem as given has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3) Then layer 2: (1+3*(layer 1)) Layer 3: (1+3*(layer 2)) And so on until layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start with layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now layer 2: (1 + 3*(layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Now layer 3: (1 + 3*(layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*(layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*(layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*(layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from layer 1: (1+3)=4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 *3: 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's a different approach. Let me add them up: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +60=88560, 88560 +12=88572. So that's the same as before. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached.

Each time I see a 3 multiplying a (1 + ...), that's a layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, that's 1, then each subsequent 3(...) adds another layer. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time you go out, you add another 3(...). Let me see: from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1 + 3*(1+3), then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. How many layers are there? Let's see, the expression is written with nine sets of parentheses: each (1 + 3(...)), so from the innermost, that's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time moving outward, we have another layer. So, if I count the number of 3s, maybe that's 9 layers? Wait, let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time moving outward, we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)), and so on until we have nine layers? Wait, actually, each time you go out, you add another layer, but the number of layers might be nine because the innermost is the ninth layer. Wait, no, let me see: starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 +3), that's the first layer. Then each time you go outward, you add another layer. So, if I have nine 3s, that would mean nine layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of 3s: the outermost is 3*(...), then inside that, another 3*(...), and so on until the innermost. Let me count the number of 3s: starting from the outside, the first 3 is the outermost, then each time you go in, another 3. Let me count: 3(...), inside that is another 3(...), so that's two, then three, and so on. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time you go outward, you add another 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2). And so on until layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, to compute this, I need to compute layer 1 through layer 9, starting from layer 1 and moving outward. So, let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because sometimes when I do mental math, I might make a mistake. Let me add 29524 three times to confirm:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. I thought there were nine layers, but when I wrote them out, I had layers 1 through 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me confirm that the original expression has nine layers of 3*(...). The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 +3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3s outside the parentheses:\n\n- The innermost is (1 +3), then each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of 3s:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s, which is 9. Because each time you go outward, you have another 3*(...). So, yes, nine layers, meaning layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 is the innermost? Wait, no, I think I might have gotten that reversed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the innermost being the first layer, and each time moving outward, adding another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 +3). Then layer 2 is 1 +3*(layer1). Then layer3 is 1 +3*(layer2), and so on until layer9 is 1 +3*(layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that would make sense. So, layer9 is the innermost, but that can't be because the expression starts from the outermost 3*(...). Wait, maybe I should index the layers from the outside in. Let me try that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of times 3 is multiplied. Each time you go in, you have another 3*(...), so the number of 3s is 9, meaning 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 +3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I have 9 layers, that would mean that the innermost is layer1: (1 +3), layer2: 1 +3*(layer1), layer3: 1 +3*(layer2), up to layer9: 1 +3*(layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that would mean I have 9 layers, starting from layer1 as (1+3), and layer9 as the innermost? Wait, no, that can't be because the innermost is the first one you encounter when you start from the inside. Let me try to visualize the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1 +3), then moving outward, each time you have 1 +3*(...). So, the innermost is layer1: (1 +3) =4.\n\nThen layer2: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is built upon the previous one, starting from the innermost. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Starting from the innermost, each time you have a 3*(...), so the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's (1 +3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of 3s is 9, meaning 9 layers. So, layer1:4, layer2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nThe general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For a recurrence relation a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms using the formula.\n\nIf n=1: a_1=(3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. But wait, our a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{part}=A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA =1 +3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have layer9, which is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed each layer step by step, and also derived a general formula for the nth layer, which confirms that the result is correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next inner layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, counting the number of 3s and parentheses, it looks like there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and then building up each layer one by one. Maybe if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the total value. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows. Let's say:\n\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a good way to break it down. So, each layer depends on the previous one, multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. This seems like a recursive process where each term is defined based on the term before it. Maybe I can compute each layer sequentially, starting from Layer 1 and moving up to Layer 9. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me do Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWhoa, that's jumping up quickly. Let me keep going.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me double-check that. So, Layer 8 was 9841, so multiplying that by 3 gives 29523, then adding 1 gives 29524. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nWait, let me confirm that calculation because that seems a bit large, but given the previous layers, it might be correct. Let me verify each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom: 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 would correspond to n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost (1 + 3) and then each layer multiplying by 3 and adding 1, as I did before. So, another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression.\n\nBut perhaps the closed-form formula is more efficient. Let me see if I can model the entire expression as a single formula.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, if each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4, then a_9 is as we computed, 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nBut if I look inside, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is similar to the previous layers. So, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself. Wait, but E is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... part is similar to E but without the outermost 3*(...). Hmm, maybe that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each layer as a term in a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me try to see the pattern again. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, after 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Because 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Yes, that's correct because 3^{11} is 3*3^{10}.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo, E = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's a much more efficient way. So, in general, if there are n layers, the expression would be (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, n = 9. Then, the expression would be (3^{9 + 2} - 3)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Which is 88572. So that formula works for any number of layers. So, if we had k layers, it would be (3^{k+2} - 3)/2. Hmm, that's an interesting pattern.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The main point is that by either computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my initial step-by-step computation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n- No more digits, so the result is 88,572. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula E = (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it then. The value of the expression is 88,572. Let me just think if there's any other way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding all the terms, but that would probably be more time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula seems much more efficient.\n\nWait, another thought: each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, perhaps the sum can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to model this. If I have a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from 4, then the terms are 4, 13, 40, 121, etc. Each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAs we saw earlier, the closed-form solution for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of the entire expression as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here because each term is dependent on the previous one in a multiplicative way, not additive. So, maybe the recurrence relation approach is more appropriate.\n\nIn any case, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and note that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) up to Layer 9.\n3. Alternatively, model the problem using a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to compute Layer 9 directly.\n4. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final value of the entire expression.\n5. Verify the result using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both approaches led to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

    "text": " \n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nSo, the structure is like a series of nested expressions, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's almost like a recursive expression. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time we go out, there's another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on, until we reach the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Continuing this way, how many times does this happen? Let me check the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original problem: It's 3 times (1+3 times (1+3 times (1+3 times ... and so on, until there are nine 3s, I think. Wait, let me count the number of 3s being multiplied. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, we have a 3 multiplied by a term. Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the left: 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside the parentheses. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is outside the first (1 + ...).\n- Then inside that, another 3 is outside the next (1 + ...).\n- This continues until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers is that? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another set. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous one. Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each layer ends with a closing parenthesis, so let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, wrapping that: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another layer: (1 + 3(...))\n4. Continuing until the outermost.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the last one ends with a closing parenthesis. Wait, let me check the original problem again. It's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3s being multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost expression and work my way out. Let me define each layer as E_n, where n is the layer number. The innermost is E_1 = 1 + 3. Then E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, until E_9, which would be the outermost expression before the initial 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by E_9, right? So, the total expression is 3*E_9, where E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8, and E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7, etc., down to E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, if I can compute E_1, then E_2, up to E_9, and then multiply E_9 by 3, I can get the final result.\n\nLet me compute each E_i step by step.\n\nFirst, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me go back through each E_i:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 *3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*E_9 = 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4 *3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 directly:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me check the number of layers again. Since each layer adds another 3, starting from E_1 up to E_9, and the outermost multiplication is by 3, so 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3. So, 9 layers, which gives us E_9, then 3*E_9. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that it's a finite number of layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize the pattern. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving it using the recurrence relation approach to see if I get the same result.\n\nGiven E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, E_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each E_n. Therefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis method gives the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar term)}\\).

Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. \n\nNow, moving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer becomes 40. \n\nContinuing outward, the next part is 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, this layer simplifies to 121. \n\nNext, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3*121 first: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, this layer becomes 364. \n\nProceeding outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, this layer simplifies to 1093. \n\nMoving outward once more, the next part is 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, this layer becomes 3280. \n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, this layer simplifies to 9841. \n\nNow, moving outward again, we have 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, this layer becomes 29524. \n\nProceeding outward, the next part is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, this layer simplifies to 88573. \n\nMoving outward once more, the next expression is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, this layer becomes 265720. \n\nFinally, moving outward to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. \n\nWait, let me check that again because 3*265720 should be straightforward. 3*265720: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. So, adding them up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000; 780000 + 15000 is 795000; 795000 + 2100 is 797100; 797100 + 60 is 797160. Yes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step simplifies the expression until we reach the final result. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer simplifies to a specific value when computed from the inside out. By systematically evaluating each parentheses layer by layer, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) and moving outward, each subsequent expression is computed and substituted into the next layer.

Maybe I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me count how many innermost expressions there are. Starting from the right, the innermost part is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. So, let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me define each layer to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each inner expression as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost one. So, starting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, up to E9, which would be the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(something). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outward, each subsequent expression is 1 + 3*E_previous. So:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me check again. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, E1 to E9 as I defined before, but the entire expression is 3*E9.

Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each step, to confirm the result.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each term is 1 + 3*previous_term, starting from 1+3=4.\n\nSo, E1=4\n\nE2=1 +3*4=13\n\nE3=1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nWith E1=4\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression for E_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say E_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, E9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each time you have a term that's 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, each layer adds another factor of 3 and another 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression.\n\nBut since the operations are nested, it's more efficient to compute each layer step by step or use the recursive formula.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n3. Compute up to the ninth layer: E9=29524.\n\n4. Multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the alternative method using the closed-form expression for the recurrence relation also leads to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Each subsequent layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).\n3. Continue this process up to the ninth layer.\n4. The ninth layer result is 29,524.\n5. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nUsing the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation confirms that the ninth layer is 29,524, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, maybe the innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3. Let me start there.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me note this down.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 equals 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\n3. Now, moving another layer out, the expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 40. So, this layer is 40.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is indeed 39, and adding 1 gives 40. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\n4. Moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute 3*40 first, which is 120. Then, adding 1 gives me 121. So, this layer simplifies to 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). Calculating 3*121. Let me do that step by step. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 300 + 60 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\n6. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, this layer is 3280.\n\n8. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, this layer is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, this layer is 29524.\n\n10. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 29524. Another way to compute this is 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6, plus 1 is 7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6, plus 2 is 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step simplifies the expression until we reach the final result. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Outermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, each step builds upon the previous one, and after simplifying all the parentheses, we end up with 88572 as the final result. I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check one of the intermediate steps to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me check step 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That's correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nAnd the final step: 3*29524 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps seem accurate. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. So maybe it's better to consider how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, each layer adds another set of parentheses, so maybe it's 9 layers deep? Let me check: Starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another 3(...), and so on. So, if I count the number of times I see a 3 followed by a (, that might tell me the number of layers. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is followed by a (, then inside that, another 3(, and so on until the ninth 3(...)). So, that's nine layers. Each layer is 3 times (1 + something). So, perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost layer and working my way outwards. Let me try that approach. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. Then, the layer above that would be 3 times that result plus 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3 times (1 + the next layer). So, maybe I can represent each layer as a term and compute them one by one. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say that the innermost expression is E1 = 1 + 3. Then, the next layer out is E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, since there are nine layers. Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe each E_i is defined as 1 + 3*E_{i-1}, starting from E1 = 1 + 3. Let me confirm that. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the outermost expression is 3*E9, right? Because the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, after computing E9, which is 29524, the final result would be 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: \n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9. Let me go back through each step to check for errors.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has another layer. Let me count how many times I see (1+3(...)) inside each other.\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are nine layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, that's correct, we have nine layers, so E9 is the one we need, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I considered E1 as the innermost (1 + 3), and each subsequent E is built by 1 + 3*E_previous. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for this.\n\nLet me consider the general case where each term is E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, starting from E_1 = 1 + 3. Then, the solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as E_k = a*E_{k-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_k = (E_0 - b/(a-1)) * a^k + b/(a-1). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation E_k = 3*E_{k-1} + 1, with E_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is E_k - 3*E_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_k^{(h)} = C*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution E_k^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, E_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each k, E_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor k=1: E_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nk=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, E_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for k=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the final answer. Wait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Because the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 +3), each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...) terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 +3)\n2. 3*(1 +3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 +3*(...))\n...\nContinuing until the ninth layer. So, yes, there are nine layers, so k=9, E9=29524, then 3*E9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula can be extended to the outermost multiplication. Let me think about that. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let the entire expression be X, then X = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, using the formula, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then X = 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct, same as before.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut in this problem, since the number of layers is manageable, both methods work.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times I see a ( after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer after the initial 3 is (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 first (\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)) \u2192 second (\n3. And so on, until the ninth (.\n\nWait, but in the expression, each layer after the first 3 adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3( appears after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are nine instances of 3( inside. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside that, another 3(...\n3. Continuing until the ninth 3(...\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3(1+3( sequences. Let me try that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of layers is one less than the number of closing parentheses at the end. Let me see: The entire expression ends with ))))))))).\n\nSo, counting the number of closing parentheses at the end: there are nine of them. So, that suggests there are nine layers, each contributing one closing parenthesis at the end.\n\nSo, that aligns with my earlier calculation of nine layers, leading to E9.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's multiplied by 3 each time. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nBut I think the approach I took earlier is correct, so the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step without using the formula, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3\\).\n   \\[\n   E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_1\\).\n   \\[\n   E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_2\\).\n   \\[\n   E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_3\\).\n   \\[\n   E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_4\\).\n   \\[\n   E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_5\\).\n   \\[\n   E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_6\\).\n   \\[\n   E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_7\\).\n   \\[\n   E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next layer**: Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times E_8\\).\n   \\[\n   E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is \\(3 \\times E_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

The something is another similar expression but one level shorter. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the left, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, the first 3 is outside, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), which is another layer. Let me count each layer:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then 3*(result of above +1)\n3. Then another 3*(result +1)\n4. This continues until the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3)\nThen each step adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s: after each 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. \n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., up to L9, since there are 9 layers of 3s after the initial 3. Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps the innermost is L1: (1 + 3). Then L2 is 3*(1 + L1), then L3 is 3*(1 + L2), and so on, up to L9, which is the outermost. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and compute each step. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + (innermost result)). Then the next layer is 3*(1 + previous result), and so on, until the outermost 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each 3 is part of a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 that's layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + layer1) \u2192 layer2.\n- Then, 3*(1 + layer2) \u2192 layer3.\n- Continuing this way until layer9, which would be the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. From the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of layers by looking at the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n- So, each 3 introduces a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n2. Then each time we go out a layer, we have another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a chain of 9 layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers in total, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). Let me confirm that. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then, inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + ...)\n- So, how many times does 3( occur in the expression?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside a new layer. Let me count the number of 3( in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another 3( inside that\n3. And so on, until the last 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each time we have 3(, so starting from the first 3, there are 9 such instances. Wait, let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count how many times 3( occurs. Each time I see a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, that's a new layer.\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 layer1\n2. Then inside that, another 3( \u2192 layer2\n3. And so on, until the last one, which is 3(1 + 3) \u2192 layer9\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is layer9? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + Layer1). Let's compute that:\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + Layer2):\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nThen,\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers I actually have. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step outward. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from layer1, how many layers are there? Let me recount:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) \u2192 layer1\n\nThen, each time we go out a layer, we have another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many 3*(1 + ...) there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 that's the first 3*(1 + ...)\n- Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...) \u2192 second\n- And so on, until the last one, which is 3*(1 + 3) \u2192 ninth?\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer. So, I think I have 9 layers in total, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, when I computed up to layer9, I got 36084. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, but when I was computing, I started with layer1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then layer2 as 3*(1 + 4) = 15, layer3 as 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on until layer9 as 36084. So, if I have 9 layers, then the final result is 36084.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each layer's result is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, starting from 4, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 3. Wait, actually, no, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, it's 3*(1 + x), which is 3 + 3x. So, each layer is 3 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nWait, that's an interesting pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers.\n\nSo, if I denote L1 = 4, then L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on. So, each layer is defined as L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1))\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L(n).\n\nLet me write down the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nHmm, so each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L(n).\n\nLet me write the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1))\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous recurrence:\n\nL(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let me find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Lh(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, let's find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), let's assume a constant particular solution, say Lp(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3A = 3 \u2192 -2A = 3 \u2192 A = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = Lh(n) + Lp(n) = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1.5 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 \u2192 C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nThus, L(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = 11*(3^n)/6\n\nSo,\n\nL(n) = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (11*3^1)/6 - 3/2 = (33)/6 - 3/2 = 5.5 - 1.5 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2) = (11*9)/6 - 3/2 = 99/6 - 3/2 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\nL(3) = (11*27)/6 - 3/2 = 297/6 - 1.5 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9,\n\nL(9) = (11*3^9)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo,\n\nL(9) = (11*19683)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\nLet me compute 10*19683 = 196830\n\nThen 1*19683 = 19683\n\nSo, total is 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nNow, 216513 / 6 = ?\n\nDivide 216513 by 6:\n\n6*36000 = 216000\n\n216513 - 216000 = 513\n\n513 / 6 = 85.5\n\nSo, total is 36000 + 85.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed each layer step by step, I got 36084 as the final result for layer9. So, that must be the answer.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3( occurs in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach 3( is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first 3( is at the very beginning: 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, how many 3( are there? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3( is the outermost.\n- Then inside that, another 3(, and so on until the innermost.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. So, each time I see a 3(, that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3( in the expression:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, let's see:\n\n1. The first 3( is at the beginning.\n2. Then inside that, another 3( \u2192 total 2\n3. Then another 3( \u2192 total 3\n4. And so on, until the innermost 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is inside the previous one. So, how many 3( are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n- The first 3( is the outermost.\n- Then inside that, another 3( \u2192 total 2\n- Inside that, another 3( \u2192 total 3\n- And so on, until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of 3( in the expression, meaning there are 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer9, and the outermost is layer1. Wait, no, actually, the outermost is layer1, and the innermost is layer9. Wait, no, I think I have it reversed.\n\nWait, no, when we start from the outermost, it's the first 3(, which would correspond to layer1, and the innermost is layer9. So, in my earlier computation, I had layer1 as the innermost, but actually, the outermost is layer1, and the innermost is layer9. That might be where I got confused.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When we have nested parentheses, the innermost is computed first, so in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the deepest. So, when I compute it as layer1, that's correct because it's the first computation step. Then, moving outward, each layer is built upon the previous. So, in this case, layer1 is the innermost, layer2 is the next layer out, up to layer9 being the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the formula I derived, L(n) corresponds to the nth layer from the innermost. So, if I have 9 layers, then L(9) is the result of the outermost computation, which is 36084.\n\nBut let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times 3( occurs in the expression:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is inside another layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 instances of 3(, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is the 9th layer, and the innermost is the 1st layer. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the outermost is the first layer, and the innermost is the 9th layer. So, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, in my earlier computation, I considered layer1 as the innermost, but in reality, layer1 should be the outermost. Hmm, perhaps I should adjust my approach.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is the first computation step, so layer1 is (1 + 3), then layer2 is 3*(1 + layer1), and so on, up to layer9 being the outermost. So, in that case, the final result is layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me recount the layers. Each time I see a 3(, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, that's layer1, then inside that, another 3( is layer2, and so on until layer9.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3( is layer1, then inside that, another 3( is layer2, and so on, until the innermost 3(1 + 3) is layer9.\n\nTherefore, when I computed layer1 as (1 + 3) = 4, that's actually the innermost layer, layer9. Wait, no, that can't be. Because when I compute from the innermost, it's layer1, then layer2, etc., up to layer9 being the outermost.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me write the expression again, with each layer labeled:\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + [Layer2])\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + [Layer3])\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + [Layer4])\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + [Layer5])\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + [Layer6])\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + [Layer7])\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + [Layer8])\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + [Layer9])\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the innermost is (1 + 3), which would be Layer9. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer1: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the outermost layer is Layer1, which equals 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, so that makes sense. Each layer is built upon the previous one, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is Layer9: 4, then Layer8:15, up to Layer1:36084.\n\nSo, the answer is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just confirm with the formula I derived earlier. The formula was L(n) = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2. For n=9, we have L(9) = (11*19683)/6 - 3/2 = 216513/6 - 1.5 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. \n\nThe expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 9: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 8: $3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15$\n3. Layer 7: $3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48$\n4. Layer 6: $3 \\times (1 + 48) = 147$\n5. Layer 5: $3 \\times (1 + 147) = 444$\n6. Layer 4: $3 \\times (1 + 444) = 1335$\n7. Layer 3: $3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 4008$\n8. Layer 2: $3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12027$\n9. Layer 1: $3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 36084$\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the very last part of the expression, I think that's the part where it's just 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me compute that next.\n\nSo, moving one level out, we have:\n1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCalculating that:\n3*4 = 12\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the next level simplifies to 13. Now, moving another level out, we have another similar expression: 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's compute that.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating:\n3*13 = 39\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nOkay, that gives us 40. Let me note this down as the next result. Now, moving another level out, again, it's 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, 1 + 3*40\n\nCalculating:\n3*40 = 120\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 121. That's a nice number, seems familiar. Maybe a square number? 11 squared is 121, right? Interesting, but maybe not relevant here. Let's keep going.\n\nNext level out, again: 1 + 3*(121)\n\nCalculating:\n3*121 = 363\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nAlright, 364. Now, moving another level out, same pattern: 1 + 3*(364)\n\nSo, 3*364. Let me compute that. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093.\n\nSo, now we have 1093. Next level out: 1 + 3*(1093)\n\nCalculating 3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280.\n\nSo, that's 3280. Moving another level out: 1 + 3*(3280)\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 9841. That seems like a large number, but okay. Let me check if I did that correctly. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Yep, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840, +1=9841. Correct.\n\nNow, moving another level out: 1 + 3*(9841)\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let me compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's 29524. Now, moving another level out: 1 + 3*(29524)\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Then add 1: 88572 + 1 = 88573.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nThere's a 0? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, actually, 2*3=6 +1=7, but wait, maybe I misaligned the digits. Let me try again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Then adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's correct.\n\nMoving another level out: 1 + 3*(88573)\n\nCalculating 3*88573. Let's compute this. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding up: 240000 +24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Then add 1: 265719 +1=265720.\n\nSo, that's 265720. Now, moving another level out: 1 + 3*(265720)\n\nCalculating 3*265720: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding up: 600000 +180000=780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. Then add 1: 797160 +1=797161.\n\nSo, now we're at 797161. Moving another level out: 1 + 3*(797161)\n\nCalculating 3*797161: Let's compute this step by step. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding up: 2100000 +270000=2370000, +21000=2391000, +300=2391300, +180=2391480, +3=2391483. Then add 1: 2391483 +1=2391484.\n\nSo, that's 2391484. Now, moving another level out: 1 + 3*(2391484)\n\nCalculating 3*2391484: Let me compute this. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Adding up: 6000000 +900000=6900000, +270000=7170000, +3000=7173000, +1200=7174200, +240=7174440, +12=7174452. Then add 1: 7174452 +1=7174453.\n\nWait, hold on. That seems a bit off. Let me check the multiplication again because 2391484 * 3: \n\nLet's compute it digit by digit:\n\n2391484\n*        3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carryover 1.\n1*3=3 +1=4, write down 4.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, the result is 7174452. Then adding 1 gives 7174453. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving another level out: 1 + 3*(7174453)\n\nCalculating 3*7174453: Let's compute this. 7000000*3=21000000, 1000000*3=3000000, 700000*3=2100000, 40000*3=120000, 4000*3=12000, 500*3=1500, 30*3=90, 3*3=9. Wait, actually, 7174453 is 7,174,453. Let me break it down as 7,000,000 + 174,453.\n\nBut maybe it's better to compute digit by digit:\n\n7174453\n*        3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3=9, write down 9.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carryover 1.\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carryover 1.\n7*3=21 +1=22, write down 2, carryover 2.\n1*3=3 +2=5, write down 5.\n7*3=21, write down 21.\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be correct. Let me do it properly:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n3 (units place) *3=9, write 9.\n5 (tens place) *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n4 (hundreds place) *3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1.\n4 (thousands place) *3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1.\n7 (ten thousands place) *3=21 +1=22, write 2, carryover 2.\n1 (hundred thousands place) *3=3 +2=5, write 5.\n7 (millions place) *3=21, write 21.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it down step by step:\n\nDigits of 7,174,453: 7, 1, 7, 4, 4, 5, 3.\n\nWait, actually, 7,174,453 is 7 million, 174 thousand, 453. So, digits are: 7 (million), 1 (hundred thousand), 7 (ten thousand), 4 (thousand), 4 (hundred), 5 (ten), 3 (unit). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n3*3=9, write 9.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1.\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1.\n7*3=21 +1=22, write 2, carryover 2.\n1*3=3 +2=5, write 5.\n7*3=21, write 21.\n\nSo, writing it out: 21 5 2 3 3 5 9. Wait, that seems reversed. Let me think. When we multiply from right to left, the first digit we write is the units, then tens, etc. So, the result should be 21,523,359? Wait, no. Let's reconstruct:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit and carrying over, the result is:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units: 9\n- Tens: 5\n- Hundreds: 3\n- Thousands: 3\n- Ten thousands: 2\n- Hundred thousands: 5\n- Millions: 21\n\nWait, so we have 21 in the millions place, then 5 in the hundred thousands, 2 in the ten thousands, 3 in the thousands, 3 in the hundreds, 5 in the tens, and 9 in the units. So, putting it all together, it's 21,523,359. Wait, but 7,174,453 * 3 should be 21,523,359? Let me check with another method.\n\nCompute 7,000,000 *3=21,000,000\nCompute 174,453 *3: 100,000*3=300,000; 70,000*3=210,000; 4,000*3=12,000; 400*3=1,200; 50*3=150; 3*3=9. So, adding up: 300,000 +210,000=510,000; +12,000=522,000; +1,200=523,200; +150=523,350; +9=523,359. So, 7,174,453 *3=21,000,000 +523,359=21,523,359. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, adding 1: 21,523,359 +1=21,523,360.\n\nWait, so that's the result at this level. So, moving another level out: 1 + 3*(7174453)=21,523,360.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression was 3(1 + ...). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside. So, let me recap:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n13. 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484\n14. 1 + 3*2391484 = 7174453\n15. 1 + 3*7174453 = 21,523,360\n\nWait, so that's 15 steps. But the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with how many levels? Let me count the number of 3(1+... parts.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis is followed by 3(1+..., so let's count the number of 3(1+...:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), then each subsequent one is nested inside. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each next 3 is inside. Let's count the number of 3(1+...:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of 3(1 + ... So, the innermost is 1+3, then each level adds another 3(1 + ... So, that would mean that we have 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, when we computed up to step 15, that was 15 levels? Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, each time we compute a level, we're moving out one step. So, starting from the innermost, which is step 1: 1+3=4. Then step 2: 1+3*4=13. That's the next level out. So, each step corresponds to one level of nesting.\n\nGiven that the original expression has 9 nested 3(1 + ... parts, that would mean that we have 9 levels. Therefore, we should have 9 steps, right? But in my earlier computation, I ended up with 15 steps. That suggests I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1 +, then each subsequent 3(1 + is nested inside. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each 3(1 + is a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nSo, yes, 9 levels. Therefore, we should have 9 steps. But in my earlier computation, I went up to step 15. That suggests that I might have gone beyond. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of multiplications with the number of levels.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Each level corresponds to one 3(1 + ... So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's level 1. Then each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, the number of levels is equal to the number of nested 3(1 + ... parts.\n\nGiven that, the innermost is level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen level 2: 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nWait, so at level 9, we have 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(result of level 9). So, that would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went beyond level 9, computing up to 21,523,360, which seems incorrect because the original expression only has 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, I think I made a mistake in the number of levels.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is level 1: 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent level adds another 3(1 + ... So, level 2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(result of level 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nAs before, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572.\n\nThen, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, so that contradicts my earlier computation where I went up to 21 million. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression, which is up to level 9, giving 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial breakdown, I thought the expression was 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost 3 is multiplying the result of level 9, which is 29524, giving 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I continued computing beyond level 9, which was incorrect because the original expression only has 9 levels. So, I think the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1 +, then each subsequent 3(1 + is inside. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nYes, 9 levels. So, after computing level 9 as 29524, the outermost operation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 21,523,360, which was 15 steps, but that must have been a miscalculation because the original expression only has 9 levels.\n\nSo, to clarify, the correct approach is:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, level 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(result of level 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify this by working through the expression step by step, ensuring that I don't overcount the levels.\n\nLet me write down the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's parse this expression step by step, working from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\n2. Moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result)=1 + 3*4=13.\n\n3. Next level out: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nNow, we're at the outermost parentheses: 3*(result from level 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I computed up to 21,523,360, which was incorrect because I continued beyond the 9 levels. So, I need to correct that.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is as above, resulting in 88572.\n\nBut just to be 100% sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, ensuring that I don't overcount.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Compute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's 10 steps, but the 10th step is the final multiplication by 3. So, the expression has 9 levels inside, and the outermost multiplication is step 10.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be absolutely certain, I can also compute this using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is"

Let me compute that first. \n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nLet me number each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then moving outward, it's layer 2, layer 3, and so on until layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, let me count again. Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+...), so layer 2 would be 3(1 + layer1), layer3 would be 3(1 + layer2), and so on until layer9, which is the outermost. Wait, but when I look at the problem, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that starts with 1 and then another 3 times a similar expression, and this repeats eight more times. So, actually, there are nine layers. Let me confirm that by counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: each time I see a '(', that's a new layer. So starting from the first '(', that's layer1, then each subsequent '(' adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n   - So, starting from the first '(', that's layer1, then each '(', so how many? Let me count the number of '(' after the first 3:\n\n- First layer: 3(1 + ... \n- Then, inside that, another 3(1 + ...\n- Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers in total. Therefore, I need to compute each layer starting from layer9 and moving outward to layer1.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I look at it, the innermost part is layer9, which is (1 + 3). Then layer8 is 3*(1 + layer9), and so on until layer1 is the outermost expression. Hmm, maybe I should define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote layer_n as the nth layer from the inside out. So, layer1 is the innermost (1 + 3), layer2 is 3*(1 + layer1), layer3 is 3*(1 + layer2), etc., up to layer9, which would be 3*(1 + layer8). Then, the entire expression is layer9. Hmm, no, wait. Let me check again. Actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the outermost layer is layer1, which is 3*(1 + layer2), where layer2 is 3*(1 + layer3), and so on, until layer9 is (1 + 3). Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute it step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Now, moving out another layer, we have 3*(1 + 15). That's 3*16 = 48. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255. Wait, that seems too large. Did I do that correctly? Let me check each step again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me list them step by step:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) So, if I have nine layers, starting from Layer1 as (1 + 3), then Layer9 would be the outermost 3*(1 + ...). So, the total value would be Layer9, which is 36084. But when I computed earlier, I ended up with 108255, which must be incorrect because I think I added an extra layer. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times '3(' appears. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of '3(' instances:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, so each '3(' starts a new layer. So, there are nine '3(' instances, meaning nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth '3(', so Layer1 is (1 + 3), Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1), up to Layer9 being the outermost expression. So, in my previous calculation, Layer9 was 36084, but when I computed step by step, I ended up with 36084 as the final answer, but when I thought I was getting 108255, that must have been a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me redo the calculations step by step:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 36084. But wait, when I initially thought I was getting 108255, I must have added an extra layer. So, the correct answer is 36084. Let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nHmm, so each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2: 8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (11*3^3 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nL5 = (11*3^4 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\nL9 = (11*3^8 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, L9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\n11*6000=66000\n\n11*561=6171\n\nSo, total is 66000 + 6171 = 72171\n\nThen, 72171 - 3 = 72168\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084\n\nSo, L9 = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 108255, I must have miscalculated the number of layers. It's important to note that the number of layers corresponds to the number of '3(' instances, which is nine, so the formula gives us L9=36084, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series. Let me think about it. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, expanding it, the expression would be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but that doesn't quite fit because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 3. Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, if I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each time, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... up to 3^8, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula we derived, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2, which for n=9 gives 36084.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

So, let me compute each layer one by one. \n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, according to this, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. \n\n3*29524. Hmm, let's do that step by step. \n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my computations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me recompute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. \n\nBut wait, let me think again about the structure of the problem. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, as we computed, each layer is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88,572. \n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. \n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. \n\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. \n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^n) + (a_0)*(r^n), but I might have the exact formula a bit off. Alternatively, since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, maybe I can express it as a_n = (3^n * a_0) + (sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k). Wait, perhaps that's a better way. \n\nWait, let me consider that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3=88,572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 *3 can be computed as (30,000 - 476)*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That's another way to check.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that's (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049\n\n3^11=177,147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177,147\n\nThen, (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 =88,572. Exactly the same result. So, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and using the formula derived from the recurrence. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

    "text": " \n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let's compute that first. \n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. The innermost expression is the last (1+3), which is replaced by 4. So now, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*(something)). The something is now 4, so that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nStep 2: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4. So, 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, replacing that part, the expression now becomes:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(13)))))))$\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm replacing the correct part. The next layer after the innermost would be (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, yes, since the innermost became 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, now, moving one more layer out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 3: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*13. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(40))))))$\n\nWait, hold on again. Let me check. The previous result was 13, so the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, replacing that, the next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 4: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(121)))))$\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me try to track this more carefully. Maybe I should write down each step and the corresponding expression after each substitution.\n\nLet me start over and keep track of each substitution step by step.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me label each parentheses layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 3(...) until we get to the outermost 3(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time we have a 3(, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent 3( adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, the initial expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so that's the first layer. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let's count the number of 3( before the innermost (1+3). \n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, that's layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another 3(, which is layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, until the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is inside 9 layers of 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3( occurs before the innermost (1 + 3). \n\nStarting from the first 3(, that's 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent 3( adds another layer. So, in the original expression, the innermost is the 9th layer? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 3( is an opening parenthesis. So:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of 3(1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is layer 9, which is (1 + 3). So, we have 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that should be the value inside the outermost 3(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which is the result of 1 + 3*9841. So, that's inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 3*29524. Let's do that multiplication.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me compute it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 3( is a new layer, starting from the innermost (1+3). So, layer 1 is (1+3), layer 2 is 3*(layer1) +1, etc., up to layer 9.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each computed as above.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, recognized the recurrence relation, found a closed-form solution, and verified that it matches the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: \n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, the next level is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me clarify. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 10: 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, hold on, the original problem is 3 times the entire expression, right? So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Level 9, which is 29524, then we multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*29524 equals... let me compute that. \n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels because sometimes it's easy to miscount when there are so many layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean there are 9 levels of nesting before the final multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's level 1, then each subsequent level adds another 3*(previous level). So, level 1: 4, level 2: 13, level 3: 40, level 4: 121, level 5: 364, level 6: 1093, level 7: 3280, level 8: 9841, level 9: 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. \n\nLet me verify each step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. \n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost part up to level 9, which gives 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer. So, yes, 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I denote a_n as the value at level n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that. So, assuming a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight-hand side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, at level n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n4. After computing the innermost expression up to the ninth level, we get:\n   \\[ 29524 \\]\n\n5. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's compute that first. \n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))$\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The innermost part is the last (1 + 3), which is the ninth one, right? So, let me number them for clarity. Let's count the number of nested expressions. Each time there's a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me see: starting from the outside, it's 3*(...), then inside that is 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, how many times does this nesting happen? Let's count the number of 3s outside the parentheses. \n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each opening parenthesis has a 3 multiplied by it, except the very first one. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first one after the initial 3: 1, then each subsequent one. So, how many are there? Let me count: \n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. That means there are 9 levels of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth level, we have (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each level will be 1 + 3*(result of the inner level). So, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each level step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet's start with the innermost expression, which is the ninth level:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level up to Level 8: it's 1 + 3*(Level 9). So, substituting Level 9's value, we have:\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...Level 1...). So, after computing Level 1, which is 29524, we then multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, Final Result = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check if I did each step correctly. Let me go through each level again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nStarting from Level 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(Level 1) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3.\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up each part:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me verify each multiplication again.\n\nLevel 9: 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 1: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinal result: 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each level seems to be following a certain progression. Let me see if I can find a formula for this.\n\nLooking at the levels:\n\nLevel 9: 4\n\nLevel 8: 13\n\nLevel 7: 40\n\nLevel 6: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 4: 1093\n\nLevel 3: 3280\n\nLevel 2: 9841\n\nLevel 1: 29524\n\nHmm, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote L_n as the value at level n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}.\n\nWait, no, actually, since we're moving from the inside out, each level is based on the next one. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_9 = 4.\n\nWait, no, because Level 9 is the innermost, so Level 8 depends on Level 9, Level 7 on Level 8, etc. So, the recurrence is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, where n goes from 1 to 9, with L_9 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to reverse the order and think of it as starting from L_1 and going up, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me consider that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nIn general, such a recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n+1} + c, the solution can be found using certain methods.\n\nWait, in this case, each term is defined as 1 + 3*(next term). So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, with L_9 = 4.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because it's going from n=9 to n=1. Let me see if I can express this as a sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the terms.\n\nStarting from Level 9: L_9 = 4\n\nLevel 8: L_8 = 1 + 3*L_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 7: L_7 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4\n\nSimilarly, Level 6: L_6 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*4\n\nContinuing this pattern, each level adds another term of 3^k and multiplies the innermost term by 3^(number of levels from there).\n\nSo, for Level n, it would be L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-9} 3^k + 3^{n-8} * L_9\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too abstract. Let me try to express L_1 in terms of L_9.\n\nSince there are 9 levels, from L_9 to L_1, each step adds another 3^k term. So, L_1 would be:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*L_9)...))\n\nWhich can be expanded as:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*(L_9 - 1)\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nActually, each time we expand, we get another 1 and multiply the rest by 3. So, after expanding all the way, L_1 would be the sum of 1's multiplied by 3^k, where k is from 0 to 8, plus 3^9*L_9.\n\nWait, let me test this with a smaller number of levels to see if the pattern holds.\n\nSuppose we have only two levels: Level 2 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Level 1 is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nIf I apply the formula: sum of 3^0 to 3^(n-1) where n=2, but wait, maybe not exactly. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is a geometric series where each term is 1 multiplied by 3^k, from k=0 to k=8, and then plus 3^9*(L_9 - 1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each expansion adds another 1 and multiplies the rest by 3, the total number of 1's would be 9, each multiplied by increasing powers of 3, plus the innermost term multiplied by 3^9.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nSo, L_1 = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8) + 3^9 * (1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, because the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, so 3^9 * 4.\n\nWait, let's compute the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8.\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a=1, ratio r=3, and n=9 terms.\n\nThe sum S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but that's exactly the value of Level 2, which is 9841. Hmm, but in our earlier calculation, Level 1 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841.\n\nWait, so perhaps L_1 = S + 3^9 * (1 + 3). Wait, but S is already the sum up to 3^8, so adding 3^9*(1 + 3) would be adding 4*3^9.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683.\n\nThen, 4*3^9 = 4*19683 = 78732.\n\nBut our sum S was 9841, and L_1 = S + 3^9*(1 + 3) = 9841 + 78732 = 88573. Wait, but that's not matching our earlier result of 29524. So, I must have made a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm conflating the levels. Let me think again.\n\nWait, Level 1 is computed as 1 + 3*(Level 2). Level 2 is 9841, so Level 1 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nBut when I computed the sum S up to 3^8, I got 9841, which is Level 2. So, perhaps Level 1 is 1 + 3*S, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*Level 1 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, in this case, the sum S up to 3^8 is 9841, which is Level 2. Then Level 1 is 1 + 3*9841, and the total is 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the entire expression. Let me think about it as a nested multiplication.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which can be represented as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain point, but in this case, it's a finite number of terms.\n\nWait, let me see: if I have n levels, then the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n levels, which would expand to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*(innermost term). Wait, but in our case, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, so 3^9*4.\n\nWait, let me try to model it that way.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 levels. So, the expansion would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nWhich would expand to:\n\n3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1 + 3^{10}*(innermost term's value -1)\n\nWait, but the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, so it's 3^{10}*(4 - 1) = 3^{10}*3.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=9, plus 3^{10}*(1 + 3). But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since it worked earlier and I got a consistent result.\n\nSo, to recap, starting from the innermost level:\n\nLevel 9: 4\n\nLevel 8: 13\n\nLevel 7: 40\n\nLevel 6: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 4: 1093\n\nLevel 3: 3280\n\nLevel 2: 9841\n\nLevel 1: 29524\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value inside each set of parentheses and substituting it into the outer expression until the entire expression is evaluated.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Expression (Level 9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 1:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Result:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. The innermost parentheses is the last (1+3), so that's 4. So, the next layer out is (1 + 3*(4)). Let me compute that next.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(4)). So, 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*13)))))))$.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me check again. After the first innermost (1+3)=4, the next layer is (1 + 3*(4)). So, 3*4=12, 1+12=13. So, the next parentheses is (1+3*13). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13). 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*40))))))$.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to structure this properly. Maybe I should number each layer to keep track.\n\nLet me denote each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count how many times (1 + 3(...)) appears. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's a (1 + 3*(...)), so there are 9 layers of these. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3 times 29524. Let's see:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, let me compute 29524 * 3 properly.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent (1 + 3*LayerN) is the next layer. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct because each opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, 9 layers in total. So, the computation seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that each layer is correctly computed, because a small mistake in one layer can throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, all these layers check out. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form (1 + 3*previous_layer). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nLet me define the layers as a sequence a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed before. So, the 9th term is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentials. 3^10 is indeed 59049, as 3^5=243, 3^10=243^2=59049. Then, 3^11=3*59049=177147. Correct.\n\nSo, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Perfect.\n\nSo, both methods, computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula, lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both approaches confirm the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern (1 + 3 * previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like there are nine layers of this. Wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, if I start from the inside, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\n2. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So, substituting the result from step 1, which is 4, we get: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So, substituting 13, we get: 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). Substituting 40: 1 + 3*40. That's 120 + 1, which is 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). Substituting 121: 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). Substituting 364: 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). Substituting 1093: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). Substituting 3280: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). Substituting 9841: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 9). So, substituting 29524: 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 3*29524 might be better calculated as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. Then: (1+3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me write down the expression structure:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(A), where A is (1 + 3*(B)), and B is (1 + 3*(C)), and so on until the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1))\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2))\n...\nHow many layers are there? The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of times (1 + 3*(...)) occurs:\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) starts a new layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nHow many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) instances.\n\nFrom the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)), right? Because each time, you have (1 + 3(...)), and it's nested 9 times. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I went through 9 layers, each time substituting the inner result into the outer expression. So, I think I did 9 steps, each computing a layer from the inside out, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me list each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, each time moving outward. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each step again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3; 360+3=363; 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\n6. 3*364: Let's compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1080+12=1092; 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\n7. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; 3000+270=3270+9=3279; 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\n8. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; 9000+600=9600+240=9840; 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\n9. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523; 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. Breaking it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my previous calculation. So, that's another way to look at it, using a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see if that's possible. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see if that's applicable here.\n\nGiven the structure of the problem, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus some constants.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is nested within the next, it's more of a recursive structure rather than a simple geometric series. However, the closed-form formula we derived earlier is more efficient.\n\nIn any case, both methods\u2014iteratively computing each layer and using the closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each a_n using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1 to 9:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nYes, all these match the previous calculations. Thus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've verified this in multiple ways: iteratively, using the recurrence relation, and with a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " It's 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times ... and so on, until the innermost part is just 1 plus 3). Hmm, so maybe I can compute the innermost parentheses first and then work my way outwards. Let's try that. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That should be easy: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, okay, so far, so good. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. The first innermost was 4, then 13, then 40. Wait, 4, 13, 40... Let me compute the next layer to see if I can find a pattern. The next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). So, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 4, 13, 40, 121... Hmm, that seems like each time, the number is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me check: 4*3 + 1 = 13, 13*3 + 1 = 40, 40*3 + 1 = 121. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, maybe each layer is the previous result multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, if I can model this as a sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, starting from 4, then I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to write this down more formally. Let\u2019s denote each nested expression as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a\u2081 is the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a\u2082 is 1 + 3*a\u2081, which is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a\u2083 is 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Continuing this way, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. a\u2081\u2080 = 1 + 3*a\u2089 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Wait, but hold on. Let me check how many layers there are. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3*...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on. Let me count the number of times this happens. Let's see: The first layer is 3*(...). Then inside that, another 3*(...). How many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3*(1+... terms. Starting from the first one:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. Continuing, 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. And so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, there's a 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers is that? Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on. The original problem has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), right? Let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the first 3*(1 + ...), then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many 3*(1 + ...) are there? Let me count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n   - So, the first 3*(... is layer 1.\n   - Then inside that, another 3*(... is layer 2.\n   - Continuing until the innermost is 1 + 3, which would be layer 9.\n\nWait, because from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 (layer 1), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the total number of layers is 9. Let me confirm: Each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), and starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, so that's layer 1, then the next one is layer 2, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, the total layers are 9. Therefore, I need to compute up to layer 9, then multiply by 3. Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(layer 9), so layer 9 is the innermost 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps around it. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nActually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Then layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost expression before the initial 3. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, yes, I need to compute up to layer 9, then multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check layer 9 again. If layer 8 is 9841, then 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do the multiplication step by step:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier I thought layer 9 was 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. But earlier, when I was computing layer 10, I had 88573. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the layer count. Let me recount the layers carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to layer 10, I got 88573, which seems conflicting. Let me check that again. Wait, no, because in the initial problem, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), so the total layers are 9, not 10. So, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought layer 10 was 88573, that was a mistake because I miscounted the layers. The correct number of layers is 9, so the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula to compute this without going through each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me see.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To make sure, let me verify with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula holds.\n\nFor example, let's take n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for these cases. Therefore, it's reliable.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down step by step by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one is of the form 1 + 3*(something). Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on, until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). So, actually, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s and see. Wait, maybe it's better to see how many times the pattern repeats. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outwards each time. Let me try to work this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(that result)). So, let's compute that. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: (1 + 3*L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, that's 13. Then, L3 would be (1 + 3*L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, let's continue this process step by step.\n\nL4: (1 + 3*L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: (1 + 3*L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: (1 + 3*L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: (1 + 3*L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: (1 + 3*L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: (1 + 3*L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after each layer, the value is getting multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous + 1. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, starting from L1: 4\n\nThen L2: 3*4 + 1 = 13, yes.\n\nL3: 3*13 + 1 = 40, correct.\n\nL4: 3*40 + 1 = 121, yes.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, if I can model this, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term instead of computing each layer step by step. But since there are only nine layers, maybe computing each step is manageable. But let me see how many layers there actually are.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, up to layer 9. So, perhaps I miscounted earlier when I stopped at L9. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is layer 1, and each layer wraps around, so the outermost is layer 9. So, maybe my earlier computation was correct, with L9 being 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L1), but wait, no, the structure is a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me try to map the layers correctly.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, as L1. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*4) = 13, which is L2. Then, the next is (1 + 3*13) = 40, which is L3. So, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, after 9 layers, the value at L9 would be 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Wait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(L1), but L1 is (1 + 3*(L2)), so perhaps the outermost is 3*(L1), where L1 is the innermost. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to structure it more clearly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's (1 + 3*4) = 13. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*13) = 40, and so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(...). So, if there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...), then the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, after computing up to layer 9, which is (1 + 3*...), the value at layer 9 is, let's see, as I computed earlier, 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that. So, if layer 1 is 4, layer 2 is 13, layer 3 is 40, layer 4 is 121, layer 5 is 364, layer 6 is 1093, layer 7 is 3280, layer 8 is 9841, layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. But wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the recurrence.\n\nWait, the recurrence is each layer being 1 + 3*previous. So, let me list them step by step:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of times we have \"1+3(\" is 9 times. So, that would mean 9 layers. So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), layer 2 is the next, up to layer 9 being the one just before the final closing parenthesis. So, then, after computing layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is consistent.\n\nWait, so that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation formula. So, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, that's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that the number of layers is indeed 9. Because sometimes when you count the number of opening parentheses, you might miscount. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3))\n\nSo, yes, 9 instances of \"1+3(\", meaning 9 layers. Therefore, the nth term is a_9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes when I'm dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount. Let me try to write down the layers with their corresponding a_n:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so a9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3. So, perhaps the sum can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution we found earlier using the homogeneous and particular solutions is correct, and it gives us a formula for a_n. So, using that, we can compute a_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, just to verify.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer adds another power of 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous total. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but that's essentially the same as the recursive approach. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the recursive computation and the formula we've derived.\n\nWait, let me also check my arithmetic when I computed 3*29524. Let me do that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, but that's breaking down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the next layer plus 1. So, if I denote the innermost as a1 = 4, then a2 = 3*a1 +1 = 13, a3 = 3*a2 +1 = 40, and so on up to a9 = 29524, as we've already computed. So, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nWait, so each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I expand it completely, it would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^9*1, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right because each term is nested within the previous. So, actually, the expression can be represented as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but with a specific structure. Let me see:\n\nWait, when you expand the expression, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another power of 3. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 1 + 3^1\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*1 + 3*3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait, but actually, each time you expand, you get 1 + 3*(previous expansion), which includes all the previous terms multiplied by 3. So, when you expand all the way, the entire expression would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9, but multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I expand that, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3^2*1 + ... + 3*3^9*1. Wait, but that's 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}.\n\nWait, because 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3^2*1 + ... up to 3^{10}.\n\nWait, but let's confirm that. Let's say we have a simple case with 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, expanding: 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3^2*1? Wait, no, that would be 3 + 9 + 27 = 39, which matches. So, in this case, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3 + 9 + 27 = 39, which is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSimilarly, with 3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(40) = 120.\n\nExpanding: 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3^2*1 + 3*3^3*1 = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120, which is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4.\n\nWait, so in general, for n layers, the expression would be the sum from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k.\n\nWait, in the two-layer example, we had 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3, which is sum from k=1 to 3 of 3^k.\n\nSimilarly, in the three-layer example, it's sum from k=1 to 4 of 3^k.\n\nSo, in general, for m layers, the sum is from k=1 to m+1 of 3^k.\n\nWait, so in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the sum would be from k=1 to 10 of 3^k.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{10}.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nHere, a=3, r=3, n=10 terms.\n\nSo, S = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3*(59049 - 1))/2 = (3*59048)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, that's a much more efficient way to compute it using the sum of a geometric series. So, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can compute the sum directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty neat.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n- Each layer can be represented recursively, leading to a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n- Solving the recurrence gives a formula for a_n as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n- For n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n- The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n- Alternatively, expanding the expression reveals it's the sum of a geometric series from 3^1 to 3^{10}, which sums to 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through the problem, both by expanding step by step and by recognizing the geometric series pattern, I arrive at the solution of 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subsequent Layers:**\n   Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\).\n\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Computation:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\).\n\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification Using Geometric Series:**\n   The expression can be expanded as a geometric series with the sum of powers of 3 from \\(3^1\\) to \\(3^{10}\\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + \\ldots + 3^{10}\n   \\]\n\n   Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{3(3^{10} - 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{3(59049 - 1)}{2} = \\frac{177144}{2} = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nCompute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step. Let's number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2 is (1+3*(layer1)), layer3 is (1+3*(layer2)), and so on until layer9, which is the outermost. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, it's 9 layers deep, right? Because each time it's 1 plus 3 times another expression, and this happens 9 times. Hmm, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of times we see a new (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3))))))))))$.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9, and working our way out to layer 1. Wait, actually, maybe I should consider the innermost as layer 1 and work up to layer 9. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2))\n...\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8))\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I need to compute Layer1 through Layer9 and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nOkay, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because 29,524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000.\n\nBut 29,524 is 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check one more time to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing the 9th term without calculating each step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: solve a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, layer9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to miscount.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} is indeed 59,049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nOkay, I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\( (1 + 3) \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( (1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer1}) \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( (1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer2}) \\)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: \\( (1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer8}) \\)\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\nProceeding to compute each subsequent layer:\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression:\n- The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times \\text{Layer9} = 3 \\times 29524 \\)\n\nCalculating the result:\n- \\( 29524 \\times 3 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe if I start evaluating from the innermost part, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 1))\n3. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 2))\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are 9 layers here because each time we have a new set of parentheses, and I can count 9 sets of \"1+\" before the innermost one. Let me check: starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So yes, 9 layers. That means I need to compute this 9 times, each time substituting the result back into the previous layer. Let me start with the innermost one.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses**\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Step 2: Substitute back into the next layer**\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(result from Step 1)). Since Step 1 gave us 4, this becomes:\n3*(1 + 3*4)\nLet me compute that step by step:\nFirst, compute the inner part: 3*4 = 12\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\nNow multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39\n\nSo, after Step 2, the result is 39.\n\n**Step 3: Substitute back into the next layer**\nThe next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(result from Step 2)). So plugging in 39:\n3*(1 + 3*39)\nCompute the inner part first:\n3*39 = 117\nThen add 1: 1 + 117 = 118\nMultiply by 3: 3*118 = 354\n\nSo, after Step 3, the result is 354.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back into the next layer**\nNext, we have 3*(1 + 3*(result from Step 3)). Plugging in 354:\n3*(1 + 3*354)\nCompute inner part:\n3*354 = 1062\nAdd 1: 1 + 1062 = 1063\nMultiply by 3: 3*1063 = 3189\n\nResult after Step 4: 3189\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back into the next layer**\nNow, 3*(1 + 3*(3189))\nCompute inner:\n3*3189 = 9567\nAdd 1: 1 + 9567 = 9568\nMultiply by 3: 3*9568 = 28704\n\nResult after Step 5: 28704\n\n**Step 6: Substitute back into the next layer**\nNext, 3*(1 + 3*(28704))\nInner part:\n3*28704 = 86112\nAdd 1: 1 + 86112 = 86113\nMultiply by 3: 3*86113 = 258339\n\nResult after Step 6: 258,339\n\n**Step 7: Substitute back into the next layer**\nNow, 3*(1 + 3*(258339))\nCompute inner:\n3*258339 = 775,017\nAdd 1: 1 + 775,017 = 775,018\nMultiply by 3: 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nResult after Step 7: 2,325,054\n\n**Step 8: Substitute back into the next layer**\nNext, 3*(1 + 3*(2,325,054))\nInner part:\n3*2,325,054 = 6,975,162\nAdd 1: 1 + 6,975,162 = 6,975,163\nMultiply by 3: 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nResult after Step 8: 20,925,489\n\n**Step 9: Substitute back into the outermost layer**\nFinally, we have the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*(20,925,489))\nCompute inner:\n3*20,925,489 = 62,776,467\nAdd 1: 1 + 62,776,467 = 62,776,468\nMultiply by 3: 3*62,776,468\n\nNow, let me compute 3*62,776,468. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me do it step by step.\n\nFirst, 60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\nThen, 2,776,468 * 3: Let's break that down.\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n76,000 * 3 = 228,000\n400 * 3 = 1,200\n60 * 3 = 180\n8 * 3 = 24\n\nAdding those together:\n6,000,000 + 2,100,000 = 8,100,000\n8,100,000 + 228,000 = 8,328,000\n8,328,000 + 1,200 = 8,329,200\n8,329,200 + 180 = 8,329,380\n8,329,380 + 24 = 8,329,404\n\nNow, add that to the 180,000,000:\n180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again because 3*62,776,468 should be computed more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me compute 62,776,468 * 3 directly.\n\n62,776,468 * 3:\n- 8 * 3 = 24, write down 4, carryover 2\n- 6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20, write down 0, carryover 2\n- 4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carryover 1\n- 6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1\n- 7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carryover 2\n- 7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carryover\n- 7 * 3 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n- 6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20, write down 0, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nWait, actually, let me do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n62,776,468\nBreak it down as 6 2,7 7 6,4 6 8\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 62,776,468 * 3:\n\n62,776,468\n*          3\n------------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n8 * 3 = 24, write down 4, carryover 2\n6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20, write down 0, carryover 2\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carryover 1\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carryover 2\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carryover 2\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carryover\n6 * 3 = 18, write down 8, no carryover\n\nWait, that seems off because when I write it down:\n\n62,776,468\n*          3\n------------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n8 * 3 = 24 \u2192 4, carryover 2\n6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20 \u2192 0, carryover 2\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14 \u2192 4, carryover 1\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 9, carryover 1\n7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 2, carryover 2\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 3, carryover 2\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 3, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n6 * 3 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1 (Wait, but we're at the leftmost digit now. So, do we add that carryover?)\n\nWait, actually, 62,776,468 has 8 digits. Let's count:\n\n6 (crore), 2 (ten lakh), 7 (lakh), 7 (ten thousand), 6 (thousand), 4 (hundred), 6 (ten), 8 (unit). So 8 digits.\n\nWhen multiplying by 3, each digit:\n\n1. 8 * 3 = 24 \u2192 4, carryover 2\n2. 6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20 \u2192 0, carryover 2\n3. 4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14 \u2192 4, carryover 1\n4. 6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 9, carryover 1\n5. 7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 2, carryover 2\n6. 7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 3, carryover 2\n7. 7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 3, carryover 2\n8. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n9. 6 * 3 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1 (Wait, but we've already processed all digits. So, do we add this carryover as a new digit?)\n\nYes, because when multiplying, if there's a carryover after the last digit, we add it as a new digit on the left.\n\nSo, after the 8th digit (which is 6 * 3 = 18, but wait, no, the digits are 6,2,7,7,6,4,6,8. Wait, maybe I got confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it out properly:\n\n62,776,468\n*         3\n------------\nLet me write each digit with its place:\n\nDigit positions from right (units) to left:\n\n1. 8 (units)\n2. 6 (tens)\n3. 4 (hundreds)\n4. 6 (thousands)\n5. 7 (ten thousands)\n6. 7 (lakh)\n7. 2 (ten lakh)\n8. 6 (crore)\n\nWait, maybe the places are different, but regardless, when multiplying by 3, each digit is processed as:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1. 8 * 3 = 24 \u2192 4, carryover 2\n2. 6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20 \u2192 0, carryover 2\n3. 4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14 \u2192 4, carryover 1\n4. 6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 9, carryover 1\n5. 7 * 3 = 21 + 1 = 22 \u2192 2, carryover 2\n6. 7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23 \u2192 3, carryover 2\n7. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n8. 6 * 3 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\nNow, since we've reached the leftmost digit, we add the carryover 1 as a new digit on the left.\n\nSo, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n62,776,468 * 3:\n\nCompute 60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\n\n2,776,468 * 3:\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n76,000 * 3 = 228,000\n\n400 * 3 = 1,200\n\n60 * 3 = 180\n\n8 * 3 = 24\n\nNow, adding these:\n\n6,000,000 + 2,100,000 = 8,100,000\n\n8,100,000 + 228,000 = 8,328,000\n\n8,328,000 + 1,200 = 8,329,200\n\n8,329,200 + 180 = 8,329,380\n\n8,329,380 + 24 = 8,329,404\n\nNow, add this to 180,000,000:\n\n180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 62,776,468 * 3 = 188,329,404.\n\nSo, after Step 9, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the previous steps because this is a big number, and it's easy to make an error. Let me recap all the steps quickly:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(9568) = 28704\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(86113) = 258,339\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(775,018) = 2,325,054\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(6,975,163) = 20,925,489\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(62,776,468) = 188,329,404\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, the final result after all nine steps is 188,329,404.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down step by step and computing each layer one by one, I was able to reach the solution without getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses. It's interesting how these nested expressions can become so large so quickly. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have given me the result without computing each layer manually, but for now, this step-by-step approach worked.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(3(1 + 3(\\text{...}))\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute the result step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 4) = 3 \\times 13 = 39\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 39) = 3 \\times 118 = 354\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 354) = 3 \\times 1063 = 3189\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 3189) = 3 \\times 9568 = 28704\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 28704) = 3 \\times 86113 = 258339\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 258339) = 3 \\times 775018 = 2325054\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 2325054) = 3 \\times 6975163 = 20925489\\)\n9. Outermost layer: \\(3(1 + 3 \\times 20925489) = 3 \\times 62776468 = 188329404\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{188329404}"

Let's compute that first. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, let me check that again. The innermost is the last (1+3), so when I compute that, it's 4, and then moving one step out, the next expression is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that next. \n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*4). First, 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So now, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me make sure I'm replacing the right part. So after replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So actually, the next step is (1 + 3*4) which is 13, as I had. So now, moving one step out, the next expression is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Compute (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So the expression now becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))))$\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm getting confused with the layers. Let me try to structure this more clearly. Maybe it's better to write down each step with the corresponding level of nesting.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*(Level 9)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level 1). So the total expression would be 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over, perhaps using a table to track each level:\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each multiplication step by step because it's easy to make an error in arithmetic.\n\nStarting from Level 9:\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*364.

So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and the arithmetic checks out. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, resulting in the final value of 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Start with the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Work outward, computing each layer step by step:**\n   - Level 8: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n   - Level 7: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n   - Level 6: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n   - Level 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n   - Level 4: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n   - Level 3: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n   - Level 2: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n   - Level 1: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by the result from Level 1:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each one starts with a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me try that.\n\nLet's start from the very inside. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So, the next layer would be 3*(1 + 3) which is 3*4 = 12. But wait, actually, looking back, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, perhaps each step involves computing 1 + the result of the inner expression, then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should number the layers to keep track. Let's count from the inside out:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12  \nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39  \nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120  \nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363  \nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that each \"1 +\" is followed by another 3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so there are nine 3s multiplied by the expressions, but each of those expressions is 1 plus another similar term. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps there are nine layers in total? Or maybe eight? Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) at the very end. Let's call this Layer 1.\n2. Moving out, the next layer is 3*(Layer 1). Let's call this Layer 2.\n3. Then, moving out, we have 1 + Layer 2, which is Layer 3.\n4. Then, 3*(Layer 3) is Layer 4.\n5. Then, 1 + Layer 4 is Layer 5.\n6. 3*(Layer 5) is Layer 6.\n7. 1 + Layer 6 is Layer 7.\n8. 3*(Layer 7) is Layer 8.\n9. 1 + Layer 8 is Layer 9.\n10. 3*(Layer 9) is Layer 10.\n\nWait, so actually, starting from the innermost, we have nine layers of 3*(1 + ...), but each time, after multiplying by 3, we add 1 and go another layer. So, perhaps the total number of operations is nine, but the layers are a bit more. Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12  \nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39  \nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120  \nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363  \nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, so according to this, the outermost layer is Layer 10, which is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092. So, the total value is 1092. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but maybe that's correct.\n\nLet me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3 * 4 = 12. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3 * 13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3 * 40 = 120. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3 * 121 = 363. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 10: 3 * 364 = 1092. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to check out. Therefore, the final result is 1092.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can represent this expression in a different way or look for a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a recursive structure where each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, actually, let me see. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, no, that doesn't match my earlier computation. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, in the original computation, Layer 2 was 3*(Layer 1) where Layer 1 was 4, so 3*4=12, then Layer 3 was 1 + 12=13, Layer 4=3*13=39, etc. So, perhaps a better way to model this is that each odd layer is adding 1, and each even layer is multiplying by 3. So, starting with a_1=4, a_2=12, a_3=13, a_4=39, a_5=40, a_6=120, a_7=121, a_8=363, a_9=364, a_10=1092.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a general formula for this recursive sequence. Let's see.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say a_n represents the value after n layers. Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, no, actually, each term after a_1 is built by going outward, so a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), but that's not exactly correct because a_2 would be 3*(1 + a_1). Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is built as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nWait, that doesn't match my earlier computation. Wait, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the original expression, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16=48, and so on. Wait, but that's different from my initial step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try computing it this way.\n\nLet me consider each layer as starting with 3*(1 + previous layer). So:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48  \nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147  \nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444  \nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335  \nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008  \nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027  \nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084  \nLayer 10: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, that's a very different result. Now I'm getting confused because depending on how I structure the layers, I get different results. So, perhaps I need to clarify the structure of the expression.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a \"1 + 3(...)\" term, except for the very first 3 which is multiplied by the entire expression. So, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then moving out, each step is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12  \nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39  \nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120  \nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363  \nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, so this seems consistent with my initial computation, where each odd layer is adding 1 and each even layer is multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 3*4=12, Layer 3: 1+12=13, Layer 4: 3*13=39, and so on until Layer 10: 3*364=1092.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, then:\n\na_1=4  \na_2=1 + 3*a_1=1+12=13  \na_3=1 + 3*a_2=1+39=40  \na_4=1 + 3*a_3=1+120=121  \na_5=1 + 3*a_4=1+363=364  \na_6=1 + 3*a_5=1+1092=1093  \nWait, but that doesn't align with the previous computation because in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*a_9, not a_10.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf I define a_1 as the innermost expression, which is 4, then each subsequent a_n is built by going outward, so:\n\na_1 = 4  \na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147  \na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444  \na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335  \na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008  \na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027  \na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084  \na_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nBut this contradicts my initial step-by-step where I ended up with 1092. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the layers are structured. Let me parse the original expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nStart with (1 + 3) = 4  \nThen, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nNext, moving out, 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \nNext, 3*(1 + 48) = 147  \nNext, 3*(1 + 147) = 444  \nNext, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335  \nNext, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008  \nNext, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027  \nNext, 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084  \nFinally, 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nSo, according to this, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2: 12  \nLayer 3: 13  \nLayer 4: 39  \nLayer 5: 40  \nLayer 6: 120  \nLayer 7: 121  \nLayer 8: 363  \nLayer 9: 364  \nLayer 10: 1092\n\nWhich gives 1092.\n\nSo, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is in how we define each layer. In the first approach, I considered that each time after multiplying by 3, we add 1, but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, the first approach where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer) would be:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147  \nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444  \nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335  \nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008  \nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027  \nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084  \nLayer 10: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 108255.\n\nBut in the initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2: 12  \nLayer 3: 13  \nLayer 4: 39  \nLayer 5: 40  \nLayer 6: 120  \nLayer 7: 121  \nLayer 8: 363  \nLayer 9: 364  \nLayer 10: 1092\n\nWhich is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether each layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, or if each layer is strictly 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4  \nThen, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nThen, moving out, 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 147  \nThen, 3*(1 + 147) = 444  \nThen, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335  \nThen, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008  \nThen, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027  \nThen, 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084  \nThen, 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nSo, according to this, the outermost expression is 108255.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had a different approach where I alternated between multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see why that approach gave a different result.\n\nIn the initial approach, I did:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2: 3*4 = 12  \nLayer 3: 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 4: 3*13 = 39  \nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 6: 3*40 = 120  \nLayer 7: 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 8: 3*121 = 363  \nLayer 9: 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 10: 3*364 = 1092\n\nBut this seems to be a different way of structuring the layers. Instead of each layer being 3*(1 + previous layer), it's alternating between multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nBut in reality, the structure of the expression is such that each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps the correct approach is the one where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), leading to 108255.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the first operation is 3*(1 + ...), then inside that, it's 3*(1 + ...), and so on. So, each time, you're multiplying by 3, not adding 1 after multiplying. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let's try that again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147  \nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444  \nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335  \nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008  \nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027  \nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084  \nLayer 10: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nSo, according to this, the final result is 108255.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I got 1092, which is different. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from how we interpret the layers. In the expression, each \"1 +\" is followed by another 3*(...), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), not alternating between multiplying and adding. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nTherefore, the correct result should be 108255.\n\nBut let me verify this by computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15  \nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48  \nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147  \nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444  \nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335  \nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008  \nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027  \nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084  \nLayer 10: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 108255.\n\nBut wait, in my initial approach, I had a different result. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn my initial approach, I started with Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 3*4=12, Layer 3: 1 + 12=13, Layer 4: 3*13=39, etc., which gave me 1092.\n\nBut now, I see that this approach is incorrect because each layer is not just multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, but rather each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the correct way is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), not alternating between multiplying and adding.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was wrong, and the correct result is 108255.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller version of the problem to see which approach is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a smaller expression, say:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, three layers. Let's compute it both ways.\n\nFirst, using the method where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer):\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \nSo, the result would be 48.\n\nBut let's compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))  \n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))  \n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 12))  \n= 3(1 + 3*13)  \n= 3(1 + 39)  \n= 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, that's different. So, according to direct computation, it's 120, but according to the layer method where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), I got 48. So, that indicates that the layer method is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was correct, and the layer method where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer) is wrong.\n\nWait, let's parse the smaller expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, moving out, compute 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nBut when I compute it directly, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so according to this, the correct result is 120, but the layer method where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer) gave me 48. So, that method is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was correct, and the correct way is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), but in the smaller case, that gave me 48, which is incorrect because the direct computation gave 120.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to parse the smaller expression step by step.\n\nExpression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Substitute back: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)).\n\nStep 3: Compute 3*4 = 12.\n\nStep 4: Substitute back: 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)).\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 6: Substitute back: 3(1 + 3*13).\n\nStep 7: Compute 3*13 = 39.\n\nStep 8: Substitute back: 3(1 + 39).\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, the correct result is 120.\n\nBut according to the layer method where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nBut that's not matching the direct computation. So, the layer method is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the layer method, I'm not accounting for the fact that each layer is 3*(1 + ...), but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), but the previous layer is the entire expression, not just the previous value.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model it as a recursive function.\n\nLet me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers.\n\nGiven the original problem has 9 layers inside the first 3, so n=9.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, but the outermost is 3*(...). So, perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147  \nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444  \nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335  \nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008  \nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027  \nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084  \nf(10) = 3*(1 + f(9)) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nBut in the smaller case with n=3, f(3)=48, but direct computation gave 120. So, that suggests that the recursive function f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) with f(1)=4 is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the recursive function f(n) represents the entire expression, but in the smaller case, when n=3, f(3)=48, but the direct computation is 120. So, perhaps the recursive function is not correctly modeling the expression.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous expression). So, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), where f(1)=1 + 3=4.\n\nBut in the smaller case, with n=3, f(3)=3*(1 + f(2))=3*(1 + 15)=48, but the actual value is 120.\n\nWait, that suggests that the recursive function is not correctly capturing the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial condition is wrong.\n\nWait, in the smaller case, when n=1, the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, not 4. So, perhaps f(1)=12, not 4.\n\nWait, let me redefine f(n). Let f(n) be the value of the expression with n layers, where each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, for n=1, it's 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3"

Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. The innermost part is actually the last (1 + 3), so the expression before that was (1 + 3(...)), so replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(result). So, maybe I should approach this by starting at the innermost and moving outward, computing each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Each time the expression is wrapped in another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outside, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), and inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 introduces another 3. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  \n2. The first layer is 3*(...). The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" inside the expression. Each time that happens, it's a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- Starting from the outside: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...)\n- Continuing this way, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur?\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)  \n2. Then inside that, 3(1 + 3(...)  \n3. Repeating this, how many times? Let's see, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 introduces another layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The first is 3(1 + 3(...\n- Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...\n- Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each time we have \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(  \n2. 3(1 + 3(  \n3. 3(1 + 3(  \n4. 3(1 + 3(  \n5. 3(1 + 3(  \n6. 3(1 + 3(  \n7. 3(1 + 3(  \n8. 3(1 + 3(  \n9. 3(1 + 3  \n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), without another 3 after it. So, perhaps there are 8 layers after the initial 3. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 as the innermost layer: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, since there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Wait, but actually, the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each introducing another 3*(...). Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"3(\" appears in the expression. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\nAfter the first 3, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is outside everything.\n- Then, inside that, there's another 3*(...), so that's the second layer.\n- Then, another 3*(...), third layer.\n- Continuing until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, each starting a new layer. Therefore, there are 9 layers in total, from L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each time you see a \"3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"3(\" adds another layer. So, in the expression, after the first 3, there are 8 more \"3(\"s. So, that would make 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but let me actually count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(  \n2. 3(1 + 3(  \n3. 3(1 + 3(  \n4. 3(1 + 3(  \n5. 3(1 + 3(  \n6. 3(1 + 3(  \n7. 3(1 + 3(  \n8. 3(1 + 3(  \n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, no, the last one doesn't have a \"3(\" after it; it's just (1 + 3). So, perhaps there are 8 layers after the initial 3, making a total of 9 layers including the initial one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 8 layers because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L8, because the initial 3 is outside of all these layers. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers. Because when I started, Layer 1 was (1 + 3), and each subsequent Layer adds another 3*(...), so after 9 layers, I end up with Layer 9 being 29524, and then the outermost 3 multiplies that, giving 3*29524.\n\nBut let me verify the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me see the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time there's a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count how many \"1 + 3(\" are present.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time there's a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(  \n2. 3(1 + 3(  \n3. 3(1 + 3(  \n4. 3(1 + 3(  \n5. 3(1 + 3(  \n6. 3(1 + 3(  \n7. 3(1 + 3(  \n8. 3(1 + 3(  \n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of \"3(\", so that would mean 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, starting from Layer 1 as (1 + 3), up to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3 multiplies Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n________\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was after 9 layers. But in the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by Layer 9. So, yes, the total is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut let me check my Layer 9 computation again because it's easy to make an error in these step-by-step calculations.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you're dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers you've computed.\n\nLet me count the number of times I've added a new layer. Starting from Layer 1 as (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if the original expression has 9 layers, I should have 9 layers of computation, ending with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3 is 8, which would mean 8 layers inside, making a total of 9 layers including the initial one. So, yes, 9 layers, ending with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence:\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4  \n6A = 9  \nA = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nNow, substituting A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4  \n9/2 + B = 4  \nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2 = -0.5\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^10 is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution for L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} is indeed a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, which we found to be -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1=4, we found A=3/2, so L_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2=(3^{n+1}/2) -1/2=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\n- Innermost layer: 1+3=4\n- Layer 2:1+3*4=13\n- Layer 3:1+3*13=40\n- Layer 4:1+3*40=121\n- Layer 5:1+3*121=364\n- Layer 6:1+3*364=1093\n- Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280\n- Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841\n- Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524\n- Multiply by 3: 3*29524=88,572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Applying this step-by-step and verifying with a closed-form solution, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3)))))))))). So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. Wait, so that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level up is 13. Now, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that level gives me 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me see if this continues. The next level would be 1 + 3*40. So, 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. That's 121. Wait, so each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me see if I can generalize this. If I denote each level as a term, maybe I can express it recursively. Let's say a1 = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait a minute, this seems familiar. The numbers are 4, 13, 40, 121... These look like they might be following a pattern related to powers of 3 or something similar. Let me check that. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243... Hmm, not directly matching, but perhaps the terms are related to (3^n - 1)/2 or something like that. Let me test this idea. For a1, which is 4: If n=1, (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That works. For a2, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. That's correct. For a3, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Yes, that's right. And a4 would be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Exactly. So, it seems that each term a_n is equal to (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. That's a useful formula. So, if I can express each level as a_n, then the total number of levels here is... Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a level. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many times does this happen? Let's see: Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so the number of levels is equal to the number of times we nest the expressions. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a level. Let me count the number of times this occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) 3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each level adds another set of parentheses. Let me see: Each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a level. So, the innermost is level 1: (1 + 3). Then level 2: (1 + 3*(level1)). Level 3: (1 + 3*(level2)), etc. So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) 3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) 4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) 5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) 6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) 7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) 8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) 9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, actually, there are 9 levels of nesting here. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me confirm: The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one. So, starting from the innermost, each level is one more than the previous. So, if I have 9 levels, then the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9. So, the expression is 3*(level9). So, level1: (1 + 3) = 4. Level2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Level3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Level4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Level5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Level6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Level7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Level8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Level9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, level9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from level1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, plus 3=363. So, 1 + 363=364. Correct. Level6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Level7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Level8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Level9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, level9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it properly. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Alternatively, I can use the formula I noticed earlier: a_n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 levels, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors. For example, when calculating 3*9841: 9841*3. Let's compute it step by step: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. So, 87000+1572=88572. Correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each level is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each level is computed as follows:\n\n1. Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost 3 by the result of Level 9:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"
