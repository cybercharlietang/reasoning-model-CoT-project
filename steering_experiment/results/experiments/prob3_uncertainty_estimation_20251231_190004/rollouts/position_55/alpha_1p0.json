    "text": " Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.

Let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way to verify. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, each being 1 + 3(...). So when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was after nine layers, and then I multiplied by 3, which was outside. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as a base case. Let\u2019s say for n=1, it's 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. For n=2, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, but in my earlier computation, for Layer 2, I had 13, and then multiplied by 3 to get 39. Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So maybe the general formula is that each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I computed each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost. So for n layers, it would be:\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to see the pattern in the a_n terms.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another condition. For n=2, a_2 = 13.\n\nSo, 13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A = 3/2 into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nBut I think my step-by-step computation is sufficient, and it confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems like each layer is following the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers are all integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I need to adjust it. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the layers. Let me list out the values again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to Layer 1, which is 4. So, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with Layer 1: n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, that also gives the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value of each layer efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify the layers again because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count how many 1 + 3(...) there are. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. So, Layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But I'm a bit surprised because each layer grows exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the growth is similar to a geometric series. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))) with n layers, is there a closed-form formula? I think so. It might be similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by b and added to a. Let me recall the formula for such a nested expression.\n\nSuppose we have x = a + b*x, then solving for x gives x = a / (1 - b), provided that |b| < 1. But in our case, b is 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula doesn't directly apply. However, the nested expression here is finite, with 9 layers, so maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nFor n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is L_n = A*3^n + C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSubtract 3C from both sides:\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrived at the same result as computing each layer step by step. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But since the expression is finite, the step-by-step computation or using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation to avoid mistakes.\n\n3. Realize that each layer follows a recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer directly.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute Layer 9, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. Verify the computations using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked my work along the way. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\), we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer: \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). \n\nFor the innermost layer (Layer 1), this gives \\(4\\), and for Layer 9, it results in \\(29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 as per the original expression yields the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: There's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So the innermost is 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(....). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3's:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Let me check:\n\nThe expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, Layer 1: innermost 1+3.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, 9 layers, each computed as above. So, my calculation of Layer9 as 29524 and then 3*29524=88572 seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall the formula for solving a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. The solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + (a_0 - c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^{n})/(1 - r), but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1) + a_0*k^{n} if I'm not mistaken. Wait, let me check. Let me consider the recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 = initial term. Then the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}. Hmm, let me test this with our values. In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, r = 3, c = 1. The initial term a_0 would be a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So, if we set n=1, a_1=4, which is 1 + 3*1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. Let's write down the first few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1, but actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on.\n\nSo, the general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me solve this recurrence relation properly.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1.\n\nSolve for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's use a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again just to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. I think I did it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think of a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSubtract 3B:\n\n-2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for the innermost layer, n=1, and the outermost layer is n=9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can directly compute the answer without having to go through each layer step by step. That might be faster, especially if the expression had more layers.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work fine. It's good to know that there's a formula, though, in case the number of layers is larger or if I need to generalize the problem.\n\nSo, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. By solving the recurrence, I found a closed-form expression for each layer, which allowed me to compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, I could compute each layer step by step, which I did initially, and arrived at the same answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\) for the \\(n\\)-th layer. Applying this formula to the outermost layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{inner expression})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the \\(n\\)-th layer. The recurrence relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence:**\n   The general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = A \\cdot 3^n + B\n   \\]\n   Using the recurrence relation and initial condition, we find:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{3}{2}, \\quad B = -\\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the closed-form solution is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer:**\n   For the outermost layer (\\(n=9\\)):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the innermost is the ninth one, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct because there are nine layers.

The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524, and then 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by finding a general formula using recurrence relations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write it out properly.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,7,7,5,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I thought each layer was being multiplied by 3, but the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 29524 is the value of Layer 9, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. So starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears nested.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on until there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I want to make sure that the expression indeed has 9 layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of ( after the first 3: Each (1+3 starts a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3 adds a layer. Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...), which is the first layer.\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...), which is the second layer.\n- Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2))\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n...\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 appears as a nested term.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each step adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many 1+3 terms are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach time there's a (, that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each adding another (1+3(...). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, ending up with 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Let me check:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nYes, this pattern holds. So, each layer is generated by this recurrence relation.\n\nNow, if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. The recurrence relation is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is Layer n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nYes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here. Since Layer n corresponds to the nth layer from the inside, and we have 9 layers, so n=9, so Layer 9 is indeed (3^10 -1)/2=29524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations:\n\n- Identified the nested structure with 9 layers.\n- Computed each layer step by step, confirming each result.\n- Derived a closed-form formula using recurrence relation, which matched the step-by-step results.\n- Applied the formula to find Layer 9, then multiplied by 3 for the final answer.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we derive a closed-form formula and compute the final result as follows:\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series with 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For n=9, Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so yes, 3*29524 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1)*(r)^{n - 1}, but wait, that formula is for a homogeneous recurrence, but in this case, it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term.\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n - 1} + c/(1 - r).\n\nBut in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again. For a recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n - 1} - c/(1 - r). Wait, I might be getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before, but maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the computed values:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each a_n is 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, but actually, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so that's correct.\n\nNow, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time for larger n, but since n=9 is manageable, perhaps it's not necessary here.\n\nBut just for curiosity, let me try to derive the formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Correct.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer starting from the innermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\):\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my multiplication earlier. Let me try again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 87572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So there's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in my addition earlier. Let me check the addition again:\n\n29524 + 29524: \n\nAdding the units: 4 + 4 = 8\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\nThousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 (carried) = 5\nTen-thousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\nHundred-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. That's correct.\n\nNow, adding another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the units:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 2 = 11, write down 1, carry over 1\n5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9 + 2 = 11 + 1 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\nThere's no more digits, so write down 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me write it down properly:\n\n  59048\n+ 29524\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5\n9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\n5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 8\nNo more digits, so the carryover 1 is added at the front.\n\nWait, actually, the numbers are:\n\n  5 9 0 4 8\n+ 2 9 5 2 4\n------------\n?\n\nLet's add digit by digit:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carry 0\nThousands: 9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\nTen-thousands: 5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\nHundred-thousands: 0 + 2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \u2192 3 (since 59048 is 5 digits, adding 29524 which is also 5 digits, but the carryover adds a sixth digit)\n\nWait, but 59048 is 5 digits, 29524 is 5 digits. So, adding them:\n\n  59048\n+29524\n=?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carry 0\n9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\n5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\nThen, since there are no more digits, the carryover 1 is added to the next higher place, making it 1.\n\nSo, writing it out: 1 5 5 7 2 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me write it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds place: 0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carry 0\n- Thousands place: 9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\n- Ten-thousands place: 5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- Hundred-thousands place: 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1\n\nSo, the sum is 1 (hundred-thousands place), 5 (ten-thousands), 5 (thousands), 1 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 59048 + 29524 should be 88572, as I thought earlier. Let me check with another method. Let's compute 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the multiplication, I got 87572. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2*3 + 2 carried) 7 (from 9*3) 5 (from 5*3) 7 (from 2*3) 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that would be 87572. But when adding, I get 88572. So, there's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to see if I messed up somewhere.\n\nStarting again, computing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it as 87572. But earlier, when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So, which one is correct? There must be a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check the addition again.\n\nIf Layer 9 is 29524, then 3 * 29524 should be 88572, as per the addition. But according to the multiplication, it's 87572. There's a discrepancy of 1000. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the layer calculations. Let me check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, layers 1 through 9 are correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 should be 88572. But why is the multiplication giving me 87572? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2*3 + 2 carried) 7 (from 9*3) 5 (from 5*3) 7 (from 2*3) 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that's 87572. But when I added 29524 + 29524 + 29524, I got 88572. So, there's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps I added incorrectly earlier. Let me try adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048 (correct)\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carry 0\n9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\n5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\nThere's no more digits, so carryover 1 is added to the front.\n\nWait, but 59048 is a 5-digit number, and 29524 is also 5 digits. Adding them should result in a 6-digit number if there's a carryover beyond the ten-thousands place.\n\nWait, 59048 + 29524:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n  59048\n+ 29524\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carry 0\n9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\n5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carryover 1 is added to the front.\n\nSo, the sum is 1 (from carryover) followed by 5, 5, 7, 2, 2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me do it properly:\n\n- Units: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds: 0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carry 0\n- Thousands: 9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\n- Ten-thousands: 5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- Hundred-thousands: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo, writing it out: 1 (hundred-thousands) 5 (ten-thousands) 5 (thousands) 1 (hundreds) 7 (tens) 2 (units). Wait, that would be 155,172, which doesn't make sense because 59048 + 29524 should be less than 100,000. I must be making a mistake in the place values. Let me try again:\n\n59048 is 59 thousand and 48.\n\n29524 is 29 thousand and 524.\n\nAdding them:\n\n59,048\n+29,524\n=?\n\nAdding the units:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carry 0\n9 + 2 = 11 \u2192 1, carry 1\n5 + 9 = 14 + 1 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\nNow, the carryover 1 is added to the next higher place, which is the ten-thousands place. Since there are no more digits, it becomes 1.\n\nSo, the sum is 1 (ten-thousands place) 5 (thousands) 5 (hundreds) 1 (tens) 7 (units) 2? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me write it as:\n\n59,048\n+29,524\n=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. So, the addition is correct. Therefore, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. But earlier, when I multiplied 29,524 by 3, I got 87,572. So, where did I go wrong? Let me try multiplying 29,524 by 3 again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2*3 + 2 carried) 7 (from 9*3) 5 (from 5*3) 7 (from 2*3) 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that's 87,572. But 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try a different approach. Let's break down 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000 * 3 + 9,000 * 3 + 500 * 3 + 20 * 3 + 4 * 3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nAh, there we go. So, the correct result is 88,572. I must have made a mistake in the earlier multiplication by not carrying over correctly.

Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me verify using another method. Let's break 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then multiply each by 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back and check if I computed each layer correctly because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let's recount each layer step by step to ensure there are no errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer builds on the previous one correctly. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this expression, which might help confirm the result without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I'm dealing with a specific number of layers (9), it's easier to compute each step. However, for understanding, let's try to find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the formula confirms that the result is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution to find the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Alternatively, each layer can be seen as a term in a recursive sequence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute each a_n up to a_9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. That's essentially what I did earlier, computing each layer step by step. So, another way to write it is that a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the closed-form formula. That's pretty neat because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if n were larger. But in this case, since n=9, it's manageable either way. So, either by computing each layer step by step or by using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result: 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the value of the innermost expression after nine layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems right. But let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.

Okay, that matches. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers, so Layer 9 is the outermost, which is inside the final 3(...). So, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I've done each step carefully, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. The key was to break down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Each time, I computed the innermost expression first and then used that result in the next layer. It's like peeling an onion, layer by layer. I was a bit worried at first because the expression looked so long, but once I started computing each layer, it became manageable. I just had to remember to carry over any numbers when multiplying and adding. It's important to be careful with each step to avoid mistakes, especially with larger numbers. But since each step built on the previous one, I could check my work as I went along. So, after computing all the layers up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, multiplying that by 3 gave me the final answer of 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. That seems right. I think I've done the calculations correctly. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check the entire expression by computing a smaller version and seeing if the pattern holds. Let's take a smaller version with fewer layers. For example, suppose the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, let's compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nIf I compute using the same method: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nMultiply by 3: 120. Which matches. So, the method works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying it to the larger expression should also work. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 87572, but when I broke it down, it was 88572. So which one is correct? Let me check 29524 \u00d7 3 again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it into parts:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe using the distributive property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So starting from the innermost, n1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then n2 = 1 + 3*n1 = 1 + 12 =13, and so on.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, each step can be represented as n_{k} = 1 + 3n_{k-1}, with n1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for n_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is n_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let's see. The recurrence is n_k = 3n_{k-1} +1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is n_k^(h) = C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say n_p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3D +1 \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is n_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when k=1, n1=4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with k=1: n1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nk=2: n2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, n9=29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*n9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general form for such a linear recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step systematically. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

Then, 59048 +29524: Let's add 59048 +20000=79048, then +9000=88048, +524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. Then, each subsequent L_n can be computed as 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but since a >1, the homogeneous solution is a^{n} and the particular solution is a constant. Wait, let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + (b)/(1 - a), but since a \u22601. However, in our case, L_1=4, so let's adjust the indices. Let me see. Let me define n=1 to 9, so L_1=4, L_2=13, etc. The general solution for L_n where n \u22651 is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a). But since a=3 and b=1, the particular solution is L_p = 1/(1 -3)= -1/2. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}. Therefore, L_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 \u2192 4 =3C -1/2 \u2192 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I started, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), but the way the expression is written, each layer is inside another set of parentheses. So, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But let me think again about the structure. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the way I computed it is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Specifically, if we define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result, which might be faster than computing each layer manually. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, this formula matches all the layers I computed earlier. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, we can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, both methods agree, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. The recurrence approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to expand the expression step by step, but that would essentially be the same as computing each layer, which we've already done.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's compute layer 4 using the formula:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which matches our earlier computation. So, the formula is reliable.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers, so we'll compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so the sequence is a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to find the particular solution and homogeneous solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is linear, we can write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, and perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series, but since I've already solved it using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - Final Expression: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify each step again because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each time, another layer.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each time we add another layer, so up to layer 9 because there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of each \"1+3(...)\" as a term, so the number of terms is 9, starting from the innermost. So, yes, 9 layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, that would mean layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the number of operations can be tricky. Let me try an alternative approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time we're computing a term as 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, let's denote a_n as the nth term, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the 9th term is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting the same result as before, so maybe that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one or two layers again.\n\nFor example, layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12\n\n8*3=24\n\n9*3=27\n\nSo, 9841*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, that's for 9841 *3:\n\nWait, 9841 is:\n\nThousands: 9\n\nHundreds: 8\n\nTens:4\n\nUnits:1\n\nSo, 9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each term step by step and arrive at the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.

Then: (1+3)\n\nWait, so that's nine opening parentheses, meaning nine layers. So, each layer corresponds to each \"1+\" inside. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct. So, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure that when I computed Layer 9, I correctly accounted for all layers. Let me recount the layers step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, Layer 9 is 29524, then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication earlier. 29524*3: Let me compute it again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524*3 in another way:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, is that the final answer? Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait a minute, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write 9, carry 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number: 9,8,4,1.\n\nSo:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write 9, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover: 29 becomes 29, so 9841 * 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_9 =29524, which is what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let's go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer correctly adds 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me pick a few layers to check.\n\nFor example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the parentheses. So, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result, which is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication, so perhaps it's a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that for such linear recurrences, the solution can be found using the formula for a geometric progression. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nActually, the homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and the particular solution is found by assuming a constant solution. Alternatively, for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n-1}*(a_1) + c*(k^{n-1} - 1)/(k - 1).\n\nIn this case, k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n-1}*a_1 + 1*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1).\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, so:\n\na_n = 3^{n-1}*4 + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (4*3^{n-1}) + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nCombine terms:\n\nLet's write both terms with denominator 2:\n\n= (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\n= (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, because 8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} = 9*3^{n-1}\n\nSo, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nSimplify 9*3^{n-1} as 3^{n+1}, because 9=3^2, so 3^2 * 3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}\n\nThus, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. This method might be faster, especially if the number of layers is large, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer computation and the formula using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. So, 3 * 29524 = 87572. Therefore, the final answer is 87572. Wait, but let me verify that each layer was computed correctly because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers.

It should be 88572, not 87572. So, the correct multiplication is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check if I computed each layer correctly because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524:\n\nAs above, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each layer is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nLet me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of layers: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are nine such layers inside the initial 3(...). Wait, actually, the initial expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are eight more layers. Wait, let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(...), inside that, there's another 1+3(...), and so on. Let's count the number of 1+3(...) terms:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is another 1+3(...), so:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nBut wait, the initial expression is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 is the outermost parentheses, which is the ninth layer. So, n=9 in our formula.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient because it uses the recurrence relation and finds a closed-form formula, which avoids computing each layer step by step, especially useful if the number of layers were much larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. However, recognizing the pattern and using the formula is a good skill to have.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we found that each layer's value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. Then, multiplying the ninth layer's value by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer's value follows a specific formula. The final computation results in the answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88,572. Hmm, but I just want to make sure that each layer was computed correctly because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let me go through the layers again to verify.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Plugging in n=1: a_1=4= A*3^1 + B => 3A + B =4. We need another equation to solve for A and B, but since it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence, maybe we can find the particular solution. Alternatively, notice that the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 +3*B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572.

Let's say, instead of nine layers, let's try two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1))) Compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1))) = 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Let's try three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Outermost: 3*40 = 120. Compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So my method works for smaller numbers, so I can be confident it works for nine layers as well.
