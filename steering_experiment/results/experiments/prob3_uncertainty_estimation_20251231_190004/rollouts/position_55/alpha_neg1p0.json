    "text": " So, 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, same as before. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine, it wasn't too bad. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, the final answer is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let's write it as 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, reading it from top to bottom: 8, 8, 7, 5, 2. So, 88752. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, because starting from the units place: 2, then tens:7, hundreds:5, thousands:8, ten thousands:8. So, 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 \u21d2 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as a function of the previous one. Solving the recurrence gives a formula, which we apply to find the value of the innermost expression. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value at the nth layer.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 (correct)\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 (correct)\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 (correct)\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 (correct)\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 (correct)\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 (correct)\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 (correct)\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 (correct)\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 (correct)\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to the closed-form solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

The general solution is L_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n =3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K =3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me double-check one or two layers to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121. So Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121. 3*121=363. 363 +1=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to compute correctly.

Because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5.

But just to be extra sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step without layers, just expanding each parenthesis one by one.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute from the inside out:\n\nStart with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, recognizing a geometric series or a recursive pattern can save time and reduce errors.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous term. This kind of recurrence relation is common in sequences, and it often leads to a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a general term.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence in standard form:\n\nLayer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\nLayer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^(h) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer n^(p) = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nLayer n = Layer n^(h) + Layer n^(p) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n = 1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nLayer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLayer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n = 9.\n\nLayer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led to the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure that's the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me go back a bit. When I was computing each layer, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 as 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing any of the layers. Let me recheck the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for all layers. So, using this formula, the value of the innermost expression (Layer 9) is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it directly using exponents, which confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result through multiple methods. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524: 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let me do this step carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see, starting with L1 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. Each term Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches L3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, and then the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me see. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, the final result is 3*L_9.\n\nLooking at the recurrence, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the final result without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nBut since the problem was presented with nine layers, I think the step-by-step approach is acceptable, but knowing the formula is a good shortcut.\n\nIn any case, after computing all layers up to L_9 and then multiplying by 3, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next \"1+3(\" is Layer 9.\n\nAfter that, we have the innermost \"1+3)\", so total layers are 9.\n\nTherefore, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, ending at Layer 9 with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the computation for each layer is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try computing the layers again, maybe in a different way to cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nGiven that, let's see if we can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, let's compute a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the earlier step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might help, but in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one with a multiplicative factor, the recursive approach seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and an additive constant of 1 at each step.\n\nBut regardless of the method, the result seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

    "text": " So, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually, which could save time if there are many layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - c/(k-1))*(k)^n + c/(k-1). In our case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_0 - 1/(3-1))*3^n + 1/(3-1). Simplifying, a_n = (a_0 - 1/2)*3^n + 1/2. Now, we need to find a_0. Wait, but our first term is a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the formula: 4 = (a_0 - 1/2)*3^1 + 1/2. So, 4 = (a_0 - 1/2)*3 + 1/2. Let's solve for a_0: 4 - 1/2 = (a_0 - 1/2)*3. So, 7/2 = 3*(a_0 - 1/2). Dividing both sides by 3: (7/2)/3 = a_0 - 1/2 => 7/6 = a_0 - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 7/6 + 3/6 = a_0 => 10/6 = a_0 => 5/3 = a_0. Hmm, that seems odd because our initial term a_1 is 4, but according to this, a_0 would be 5/3. Wait, maybe I misapplied the indices. Because in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. But in the general formula, a_0 is the term before a_1. So, perhaps a_0 is the term when n=0, which isn't part of our problem. But since we have a_1 = 4, let's see if we can adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the recurrence starting from n=1. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we have: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (only 9), it's manageable to compute each step. However, for the sake of understanding, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me see: the innermost is a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nThen, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. It confirms the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives us 29,524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, going back, each layer was computed correctly.

The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Each \"1+\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each time we have a new set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each 1+3 opens a new set. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: After the first 3, we have (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, right? Because each \"1+\" starts a new set. So, that means we have 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, my initial calculation with 9 layers seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again. 3*1093: 1093*3: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer is computed correctly. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression from the inside out, step by step, without labeling layers, to see if I get the same result. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStart with 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually seems feasible and accurate.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. 8+4=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 4+2=6 +1=7. 0+5=5. 9+9=18, write down 8, carryover 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So, that must be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572 Yes, that seems correct. I think I did everything right. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3(4) = 13  \n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3(13) = 40  \n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3(40) = 121  \n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3(121) = 364  \n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3(364) = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:  \n29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572  \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, I think. Let me check again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier when I wrote 87572. It's actually 88572. Let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recast the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try computing the expression step by step without assigning layers, just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or miscalculate. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I got before. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to follow logically from the previous one, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4.

So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation here. To solve this recurrence, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but it's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with exponents and multiple layers of operations. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This pattern continues up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

There's a discrepancy here.

I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication by not correctly handling the carry-over. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the initial step-by-step multiplication, I had:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     *        3\n     ------------\n       8 8 2 7 2\n\nBut that's incorrect because when I carry over from the 9*3, I should have 27 + 1 = 28, so write down 8 and carry over 2. Then, 2*3 + 2 = 8, correct. So, the digits should be 8 (from 2*3 + 2), 8 (from 9*3 +1), 2 (from 5*3 +1), 7 (from 2*3), 2 (from 4*3). Wait, but that would be 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 2 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units), which is 88272. But when I add, it's 88572. There's a conflict here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572. Therefore, my initial multiplication was wrong because I must have misplaced the digits or miscalculated the carry-over. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, the initial step-by-step multiplication was incorrect because of a miscalculation in the carry-over. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let's go back to the problem. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which was 29524, I multiply that by 3 to get the final answer. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step computation of the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, right? Let me verify that because if that's incorrect, then the final answer would be wrong.\n\nLet me recast the problem: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier multiplication, I got confused because I thought the multiplication was wrong, but after verifying, it's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093.

Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me think about it. If I denote the innermost term as a1, then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a3=1 +3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, I think. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's see, when n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Perfect. So, both methods, iterative computation and using the recurrence relation formula, lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is:\n\nLayer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1)\n\nWith Layer(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. At n=1, Layer(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, the recurrence is Layer(n) - 3*Layer(n-1) = 1. Let me check the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is Layer(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nWait, that seems odd, but let's proceed. So the general solution is Layer(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: Layer(1)=4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, Layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, Layer(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have Layer 9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer(9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same answer.

Each layer is correctly calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula also gives me 88572, confirming that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step or using a derived formula, we find the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the number is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. Because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and finding a general formula, verified the calculations, and arrived at the same answer both ways. So, I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recursive pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a general formula, we find the solution to be:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading it from the bottom, it's 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88572. Wait, that seems off because 30000*3 is 90000, so 29524*3 should be just under 90000, right? Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let's think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the sequence would be: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, the total expression would be 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think if there's a pattern or a geometric series here.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each next layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nWait, the general form for such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which is 1+3(...), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nYes, so there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer adds a power of 3, perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in any case, the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...).

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1\n\nSo, K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, that confirms that Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nTherefore, the expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading from the top, it's 87572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Let me verify that multiplication another way to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048 (since 29524 * 2 = 59048)\n59048 + 29524 = 88572? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no, 59048 + 29524. Let me add them:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n0 +5 =5, write 5.\n9 +9 =18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 +2 =7 +1=8, write 8.\nSo, it's 88572. Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the initial digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- Units digit: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, that gives 87572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me recalculate 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms that 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. I must have misaligned the digits. Let me try that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the place values when I did the digit-by-digit earlier. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But that conflicts with the addition method which gave 88572. Hmm, clearly, something is wrong here. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, 29524 + 29524 is 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nLet me add digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n0 +5 =5, write 5.\n9 +9 =18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 +2 =7 +1=8, write 8.\n\nSo, that gives 88572. Therefore, 29524 * 3 = 88572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit alignment. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 * 3 =15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 =6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But this contradicts the addition method. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me check the number of digits in 29524. It's 5 digits: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when I multiply by 3, the result should be:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, that's 87572. But when adding, I get 88572. There's a conflict here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the addition again:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048 (correct)\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet me add 59048 + 29524 step by step:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n88548 + 20 = 88568\n88568 + 4 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I must have miscounted the digits or made an error in the calculation. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but that means my earlier layers might be wrong. Let me go back and check each layer computation to ensure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, there are nine layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, my calculation of nine layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can directly compute the result without manually computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially for a larger number of layers. But since the problem only had nine layers, both methods worked.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the recurrence relation, we arrive at the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see, for n=1: a1=4. n=2: a2=1 +3*4=13. n=3: a3=1+3*13=40. n=4:1+3*40=121. n=5:1+3*121=364. n=6:1+3*364=1093. n=7:1+3*1093=3280. n=8:1+3*3280=9841. n=9:1+3*9841=29524. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.

Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me try to model it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, solving this recurrence relation, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check if this holds for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and the total expression is 3*a_9. Using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the geometric series formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can solve it step by step. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to the general solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could represent this expression, perhaps a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing the value without having to compute each layer manually, especially if there are many layers.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for all the layers. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the general formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think I've considered this problem thoroughly, checked each step, and even found a formula to represent the nested expression, which validated the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 + 3*(previous term). Starting from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer outward.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Now, 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try computing one of the layers again to check. For example, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. That's correct. Similarly, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems to add up correctly. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers, maybe there's a geometric series or some recursive formula here. Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's try solving the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the equation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the layers we computed. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. That was a good exercise; it confirmed that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and starting from L_1=4, we can express L_n as a sum of a geometric series. Let's try expanding the expression:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L_{n-3})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_{n-3}\nContinuing this pattern, eventually, we'll get to L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_0.\n\nBut wait, L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps L_0 would be 1. Let me check: If n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_1=4, then 4 = 1 + 3*L_0 => 3*L_0 =3 => L_0=1. So, yes, L_0=1.\n\nTherefore, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*L_0.\n\nBut L_0=1, so L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k - 1 (since the sum from k=0 to n-1 is sum from k=0 to n minus 3^n). Wait, no: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is equal to (3^n - 1)/2. Because the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's recall that the sum of a geometric series with ratio r is S = (r^{m+1} -1)/(r -1). Here, r=3, so S = (3^{m+1} -1)/(3-1) = (3^{m+1} -1)/2. So, sum_{k=0}^{m} 3^k = (3^{m+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, for L_n, the sum is up to k= n-1, so m =n-1. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nThen, L_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 3^n*L_0. But L_0=1, so L_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 3^n*1 = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 2*3^n/2 = (3^n -1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But since in this problem there are only nine layers, both methods are manageable.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then an additional 1 is added. This is similar to the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but with an added constant at each step. The closed-form formula we derived earlier handles this situation perfectly.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer.

Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check if I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent ones would be wrong. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, leading up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...), but when I started counting, I considered the innermost as Layer 1, so the outermost would be Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. It's quicker and avoids computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, step-by-step wasn't too bad either.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if the formula holds for n=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 87, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, no, let me write it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrived at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is essentially building up a geometric progression. Each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1, which is the essence of a geometric series with ratio 3. The closed-form solution we derived aligns with this understanding.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again, perhaps using a different method.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each time we're adding 1 and tripling the result. So, for example:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
