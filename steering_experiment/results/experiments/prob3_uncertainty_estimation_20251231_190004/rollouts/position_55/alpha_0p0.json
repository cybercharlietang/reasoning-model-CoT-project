    "text": " Let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 (correct) Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88,572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing a few layers again or see if there's another way to approach it. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29,524 = 88,572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so total 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding up: 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding up: 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's do it step by step. 9000*3=27,000. 800*3=2,400. 40*3=120. 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Now, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute this carefully. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, writing it out: 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can check this using another method. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if it directly applies here because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, let's see. Each layer is defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, this method confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. Using a recursive formula and verifying with a closed-form solution, we confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So that would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572 as the final answer. But let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1+3(...) is a layer. So, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with how many 1+3s?\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate layer. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), it's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3*, there are 9 layers of (1+3*(...)). So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time adding another (1+3*(...)). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. Each time I have a (1+3(...)), that's a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. Therefore, computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me check if I've correctly accounted for each layer. Maybe I missed a layer. Let me recount.\n\nLet me write the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3. Then, moving out, each (1+3(...)) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) terms:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3 \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next layer: 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I computed Layer 9, I correctly used Layer 8's value. Layer 8 was 9841, right? So 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 88572 seems like a large number, but considering each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, it might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. Each layer is f applied to the previous layer. So, starting from x\u2080 = 1, then x\u2081 = f(x\u2080), x\u2082 = f(x\u2081), and so on up to x\u2088, since there are 9 layers (from x\u2080 to x\u2088). Then, the final result is 3*x\u2088.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me see: The innermost is x\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then x\u2081 = 1 + 3*x\u2080 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. x\u2082 = 1 + 3*x\u2081 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. x\u2083 = 1 + 3*x\u2082 = 1 + 120 = 121. x\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. x\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. x\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. x\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. x\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the final result is 3*x\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, with x\u2080 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is x\u2099^(h) = C*3\u207f.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution x\u2099^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is x\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition x\u2080 = 1:\n\n1 = C*3\u2070 - 1/2 \u2192 1 = C*1 - 1/2 \u2192 C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, x\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, x\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n goes from 0 to 8. Therefore, x\u2088 = (3\u2079\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3\u00b9\u2070 is 59049, so x\u2088 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*x\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I also get 88572. That confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3\u00b9\u2070 to confirm it's 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, x\u2088 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also gave me the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer's value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2} &= 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3} &= 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4} &= 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5} &= 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6} &= 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7} &= 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8} &= 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9} &= 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 again because 29524 is a large number and I want to be absolutely sure.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for solving such equations.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the general formula approach. Let me verify with a smaller n. For example, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Which is correct as computed earlier. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, I can trust that a_9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nExpanding this, each time we have a 3 multiplied by a sum that includes 1 and another 3 times a sum, etc. So, if I expand all the layers, it's a sum of 3's raised to various powers. Let me try to see the pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2\n\nWait, 13 = 1 + 3 + 9. Yes, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So that's 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, yes. So each layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum from k=0 to 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n is sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/2. Which matches the formula we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we found.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, another way to think about it is that the expression is 3 times the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^9. That's a total of 10 terms, so the sum is (3^{10} -1)/2, multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which confirms our earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, derive a general formula using recurrence relations, or recognize it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all methods lead to the same result. So I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric series pattern. The final result is computed by recognizing the sum of the geometric series and multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a geometric series.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the General Formula**: Recognizing the series as geometric, the sum of the first n terms is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9 (n=9), the sum is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, it was 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Each time, I computed from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Then, solving for x would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series. However, in this case, we have a finite number of layers, so it's a finite recursion. Alternatively, each layer can be represented as x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, starting from x_1 = 1 + 3. So, x_1 = 4, x_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, x_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, computing each x_n up to n=9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Therefore, I think my approach is correct, and the final answer is indeed 88572. Wait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can write this as a sum. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's like 3^8*(1) + 3^7*(1) + ... + 3^0*(1), but I'm not sure. Wait, let's see. Each layer adds another power of 3. Let me think recursively. Let me denote f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nf(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +12=13\n\nf(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to f(9). Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, if I can find a formula for f(n), that might help. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) =1 +3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let's find C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + C =1 +3*(A*3^{n-1} + C)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 +3*A*3^{n-1} +3*C =1 + A*3^n +3*C\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + C\n\nRight side:1 + A*3^n +3*C\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nA*3^n + C =1 + A*3^n +3*C\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nC =1 +3*C\n\nThen, -2C=1 => C= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n)=A*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 =>4 =3A -1/2 =>3A=4 +1/2=9/2 =>A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, f(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nHmm, this seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but using the formula, perhaps we can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Which confirms our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation leading to a closed-form solution. The final computation results in 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n4. **Verification Using Formula**: Recognizing the recurrence relation, we derive the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince there are 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 9 was 29524. Let me compute (3^{10} -1)/2:\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure accuracy. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I added the digits, I think I might have miscounted. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (from ten-thousands), 8 (from thousands), 5 (from hundreds), 7 (from tens), 2 (from units). So, 88572. Hmm, but when I did the initial calculation, I thought it was 87572, but now I'm getting 88572. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check my earlier computations of each layer because I might have made a mistake there.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of the layers, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), and that seems correct. But maybe I should try a different approach to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I compute a_9 correctly, then multiply by 3, I should get the answer. Let me compute a_1 to a_9 again:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers, just to see if I get the same result. Let's try expanding the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the final value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:** 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression.

This is similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a structure.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, a9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine terms, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049, so a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Because each layer depends on the previous one, and if I messed up one layer, the rest would be wrong.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step without breaking it into layers, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It might be possible to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a = 1 and b = 3.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but wait, actually, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 =729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSimplify that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods confirm that the result is 88572. So, I feel confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me recalculate 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it digit by digit again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing from left to right: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But when I broke it down into place values, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm, let me check the place values again.\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units.\n\nSo, 2*3=6 (ten thousands), 9*3=27 (thousands), 5*3=15 (hundreds), 2*3=6 (tens), 4*3=12 (units).\n\nBut when you add them up, you have to consider the carryovers:\n\n- Units: 12 \u2192 2 with carryover 1\n- Tens: 6 + 1 = 7\n- Hundreds: 15 \u2192 5 with carryover 1\n- Thousands: 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8 with carryover 2\n- Ten thousands: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result should be 88,752. But when I did the place value method, I added 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12, which is 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's 88,572, which is different. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, I think the place value method is incorrect because when you break it down, the carryovers aren't considered in the same way. Let me try to add them step by step:\n\nStart with 60000 (from 20000*3)\n\nAdd 27000 (from 9000*3): 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nAdd 1500 (from 500*3): 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nAdd 60 (from 20*3): 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nAdd 12 (from 4*3): 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88,752. There's a discrepancy of 180. That's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let me check 29524 * 3 another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 7 5 2 \u2192 88,752.\n\nWait, but when I did the place value method, I got 88,572. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 using another method, perhaps adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carryover 0\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so adding 29524 three times gives 88,572, which contradicts the digit-by-digit multiplication which gave 88,752. That means I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, let me check the digit-by-digit again. Maybe I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units)\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing from ten thousands to units: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). So that's 88,752.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using a calculator method. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, according to this, it's 88,572. But the digit-by-digit method gave me 88,752. There's a conflict here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the digit-by-digit again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from the ten thousands place), 8 (from the thousands), 7 (from the hundreds), 5 (from the tens), 2 (from the units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But when I added the place values, I got 88,572. That suggests that I made a mistake in the place value addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the place values. Let me list the place values again:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them step by step:\n\nStart with 60000 (from 20000*3)\n\nAdd 27000: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nAdd 1500: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nAdd 60: 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nAdd 12: 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, according to this, it's 88,572. But the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 88,752. There's a clear inconsistency here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check again:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8 \u2192 but that's not correct because we start writing from the right. Wait, no, when you write down the multiplication, you start from the right and move left, so the first digit you write is the units, then tens, etc. So, the result should be 88,752. But when I add the place values, I get 88,572. That suggests that one of the methods is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the place values in the digit-by-digit method. Let me write it out properly:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right (ten thousands to units): 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88,752.\n\nBut when I added the place values, I got 88,572. So, which one is correct? Let me check using a different approach. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using the standard algorithm:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n   ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,752. Therefore, the correct answer must be 88,752. The place value method must have been miscalculated earlier. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, when I broke it down into place values, I added 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. But let me write it as:\n\n60000 (from 20000*3)\n\n+27000 (from 9000*3) = 87000\n\n+1500 (from 500*3) = 88500\n\n+60 (from 20*3) = 88560\n\n+12 (from 4*3) = 88572\n\nWait, but according to the digit-by-digit method, it's 88,752. So, where is the mistake? Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method: break it into 29524 * (3) = 29524 * (2 + 1) = 29524*2 + 29524*1.\n\nCompute 29524*2:\n\n29524 * 2:\n\n4*2=8\n\n2*2=4\n\n5*2=10\n\n9*2=18\n\n2*2=4\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524 * 2 = 59048\n\nThen, 29524*1 = 29524\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5, carryover 0\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 +1=8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572.\n\nWait, so now I have two different results: 88,752 from digit-by-digit multiplication and 88,572 from the place value addition and the 2+1 method. There's a contradiction here, which means I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me try to compute 29524 * 3 using another approach. Let me compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's 88,572. So, that matches the place value method and the 2+1 method. But the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 88,752, which is different. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit method?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out again:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, no, when you write the result, you start from the rightmost digit, so the first digit is 2 (units), then 7 (tens), then 5 (hundreds), then 8 (thousands), then 8 (ten thousands). So, the number is 88,752. But according to the other methods, it's 88,572. That suggests that my digit-by-digit method is wrong, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions when writing down the result. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: units=2, tens=7, hundreds=5, thousands=8, ten thousands=8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But according to the other methods, it's 88,572. So, perhaps I'm miscounting the places in the digit-by-digit method. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the other methods.\n\nWait, let's use a calculator to verify. 29524 * 3 = ?\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, according to a calculator, it's 88,572. Therefore, the digit-by-digit method must have been wrong. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me try again:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits as we get them: 2,7,5,8,8. But when writing the number, the first digit is the units place, so it's 2, then tens=7, hundreds=5, thousands=8, ten thousands=8. So, the number is 88,752. But the calculator says 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication of the thousands place. Let me check:\n\n9 (thousands place) *3 =27, plus carryover 1 is 28. So, write down 8, carryover 2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 2 (ten thousands place) *3 =6 +2=8. That seems correct.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But according to the calculator, it's 88,572. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the original problem again. The problem is: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=?\n\nSo, according to this, the final step is 3*29524, which we thought was 88,752, but the calculator says 88,572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try to compute 29524*3 using the standard algorithm again, carefully.\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. So, the number is 88,752.\n\nBut when I compute it using the place value method or adding 29524 three times, I get 88,572. There's a clear inconsistency here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check using another approach: compute 29524 * 3 using the lattice method or another multiplication technique.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should accept that there's a miscalculation somewhere and refer back to the problem. The problem is to compute 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute this using a different approach: break down 29524 into 29000 + 524.\n\nSo, 29524 = 29000 + 524\n\nThen, 3*29000 = 87000\n\n3*524 = 1572\n\nNow, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's 88,572. Therefore, the correct answer must be 88,572. The digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong because it gave a different result. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Perhaps I misaligned the digits or made an arithmetic error.\n\nIn any case, based on the place value method and breaking it down into parts, the correct answer is 88,572. Therefore, the final result of the original expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3 = 4. Repeating this process for each layer up to the ninth layer gives 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 yields the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " So, let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 87,572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29,524 * 3 step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572? Wait, no, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it properly. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3 is 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. Let's add them up. 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. 59,048 + 29,524: 59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048; 79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer is built on the previous one, so if I messed up any layer, the final result will be off. Let me recompute each layer step by step to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), right? Let me count the opening parentheses: Starting from the innermost, each time I see a (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears before the final closing parenthesis. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's enclosed in another 1+3(...). So, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Up to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8). So yes, nine layers. So, my computation up to Layer 9 is correct. So, 3*(Layer9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^{n} * (a_1 - c/(1 - r)). Wait, but in this case, r is 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be different. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me confirm that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying the initial condition a_0: Let's see, in our case, a_1 = 4. Wait, but in the standard form, a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, so a_0 would be the first term. But in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, where a_0 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, maybe I'm mixing up the indices. Let me redefine: Let\u2019s say a_1 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, to find a general formula for a_n, we can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be assumed to be a constant K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, 3^{11}=177,147. Then, 3^{11} -3=177,147 -3=177,144. Divide by 2:177,144/2=88,572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. We can see that this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me check. So, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d. Here, r=3, d=1. The solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + d*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, maybe a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But I'm not sure if this applies directly here. Alternatively, let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, after computing up to a_9, which is 29524, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, since we started from a_1 and went up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, we could have computed it using the formula: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to get there. But since I was able to compute it step by step, and both methods give the same result, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer adds 3 times the previous result plus 1. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. Yep, that's nine layers, each correctly computed. So, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the problem is 3*(...), and each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count how many times 1+3(...) appears.\n\nFrom the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each time wrapping another 1+3*(Layer n). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is built by adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(...), so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, in total, 9 layers, each computed as above.\n\nSo, Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is 1+3=4, then a_2=1+3*a1, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1= C*3^1 -1/2= 3C -1/2=4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form solution to find the ninth layer's value efficiently. Multiplying this value by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula holds. So, L_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, used a formula approach, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if there's a quicker way instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe a better approach is to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The characteristic equation for this recurrence is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct, Layer 4. For n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct, Layer 5. For n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct, Layer 6. For n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct, Layer 7. For n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct, Layer 8. For n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, Layer 9. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3 * a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. But it's good to know the general formula in case I have to compute this for more layers in the future. So, to summarize, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, I arrived at the value of 29524 for the innermost expression. Then, multiplying that by 3 gave me the final answer of 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88572. I think that's thorough enough.

    "text": " So, let's do it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones. So:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that by another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computations. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, I think I've computed it correctly. Alternatively, I could have recognized a pattern or used a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was working it out step by step, the manual computation was a good exercise.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Recognizing this pattern allows us to compute each subsequent layer efficiently. After computing each layer up to the ninth one, we find the value and then multiply it by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me verify my calculations step by step because sometimes when I compute multiple layers, I might make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is a geometric series with n terms, where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), which is a bit different. Wait, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out, so I think I did it right. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because when I was computing the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, but let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) nine times. So, the way I computed Layer9 as 29524 and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572, which should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might save time in the future. Let me see if the layers follow a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nHmm, each layer seems to be 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me check:\n\nLayer2: 3*4 +1=13 \u2192 correct\n\nLayer3:3*13 +1=40 \u2192 correct\n\nLayer4:3*40 +1=121 \u2192 correct\n\nYes, so each layer is 3n +1, where n is the previous layer. So, in general, Layer k = 3*(Layer k-1) +1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term, but since n here is 9, it's manageable to compute step by step as I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation can be solved as follows:\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D +1 \u2192 D -3D =1 \u2192 -2D=1 \u2192 D= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C -1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation formula, we find that each layer a_n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, let me try computing the expression in a different way. Maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Okay, so I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u21924 =3A -1/2 \u21923A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. Using the formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, both methods lead to the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula to the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Each layer \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the Recurrence:**\n   The general solution is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the 9th Layer:**\n   \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3\u00d7Layer (n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is Layer n = a\u00d7Layer (n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The formula is:\n\nLayer n = (b / (a - 1)) \u00d7 (a^n - 1)\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a recurrence relation like x_n = a x_{n-1} + b, with x_0 = c, the solution is x_n = a^n x_0 + b (a^n - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nIn our case, starting from Layer 1: x_1 = 1 + 3\u00d7x_0, but wait, actually, in our problem, Layer 1 is x_1 = 1 + 3\u00d71, which would be x_1 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the layers starting from 0. Let me adjust.\n\nLet me define Layer 0 as x_0 = 1.\n\nThen Layer 1: x_1 = 1 + 3\u00d7x_0 = 1 + 3\u00d71 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: x_2 = 1 + 3\u00d7x_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found as follows.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution, which is the solution to x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x_n^{(h)} = C\u00d73^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say x_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 1 + 3A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 0 = 1 + 2A \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is x_n = x_n^{(h)} + x_n^{(p)} = C\u00d73^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition x_0 = 1:\n\nx_0 = C\u00d73^0 - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 1 \u2192 C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is x_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=0: x_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=1: x_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: x_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: x_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: x_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: x_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: x_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: x_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: x_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 x_9 = 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572, as computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 x_9, which is 3 \u00d7 (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, then also verified using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, that was the innermost part of the outermost expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me check if that's the correct final answer. Alternatively, maybe I should have stopped at Layer 9 without multiplying by 3? No, because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation of Layer 9 again. Layer 8 was 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n3*800 = 2400\n3*40 = 120\n3*1 = 3\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial problem again to ensure I copied it correctly. It was: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Counting the number of 1+3 sections, starting from the innermost, there are nine of them, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each 1+3(...) adds one more layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in total, how many layers? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, actually, each time I add a layer, I add another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds one more. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is the outermost expression inside the initial 3(...). So, yes, I think I did that correctly.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write out the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer1.\n2. Then, moving out, we have 1+3(Layer1) = Layer2.\n3. Then, 1+3(Layer2) = Layer3.\n4. Then, 1+3(Layer3) = Layer4.\n5. Then, 1+3(Layer4) = Layer5.\n6. Then, 1+3(Layer5) = Layer6.\n7. Then, 1+3(Layer6) = Layer7.\n8. Then, 1+3(Layer7) = Layer8.\n9. Then, 1+3(Layer8) = Layer9.\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers, from 1 to 9, each wrapping the previous one. So, computing each layer step by step up to Layer9, then multiplying by 3 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations for each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I was computing Layer9, I wrote that 3*9841 is 29523, which is correct, and then adding 1 gives 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication of 3*9841 again, because if I make a mistake here, it would affect the entire result.\n\n3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n- 1*3 = 3\n- 4*3 = 12, carry over 1\n- 8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carry over 2\n- 9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n9841\n*    3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, Layer9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524*3 once more.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach 1+3(...) adds another set. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times, right? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like nine layers. So, yes, nine layers from 1 to 9. So, my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence, I can find a particular solution and the homogeneous solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, so the solution can be found using iteration.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can use this formula to compute a_n more directly without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}, so 3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049, so 3^11=3*59049=177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is correct. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me write it properly:\n\n3\nx29524\n--------\n\nStarting multiplication:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. 2 + 0 = 2. So, 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.

(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recursive pattern.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me define the layers as follows:\n\nLet a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, in this case, n goes from 1 to 9, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, we can write the recurrence relation as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me try expanding the expression to see if that's the case.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the next layer is E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but if I expand E3, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nIf I expand E4, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*13) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nI can see that each layer adds another power of 3 multiplied by 1, but perhaps there's a pattern.\n\nWait, let me think about the expansion. Each time we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nIf I expand it fully, each term would be 3^k * 1, for k from 0 up to some number.\n\nWait, let me try to write out the expansion for a smaller number of layers to see the pattern.\n\nSuppose I have only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nIf I have two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so maybe the expansion would involve 3^9 terms.\n\nWait, let me try to expand E1 through E3:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nIf I expand E3, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, E3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is the sum from k=0 to k=3 of 3^k, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nSimilarly, E2 was 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.\n\nE1 was 4, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.\n\nSo, it seems that En = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, for E1, n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3: n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, indeed, En = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for E9, which is the 9th layer, En = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, this method also confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, and the number of terms corresponds to the number of layers.\n\nWait, since each layer adds another 3^k term, maybe the sum is a geometric series with ratio 3 and a certain number of terms.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each En is the sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, no, because when I expand E3, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is indeed the sum from k=0 to k=3 of 3^k, which is (3^4 -1)/(3 -1) = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, E2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is the sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k, which is (3^3 -1)/2 = 13.\n\nSo, in general, En = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for E9, n=9: En = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer, which makes me confident that it's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute the layers again step by step, but this time, using the formula for En.\n\nCompute each En using En = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, everything checks out. I think I've got the correct answer here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively adding another term in a geometric progression. So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that sum. So, each time, the value is tripling and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth, hence the 3^k terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms multiplied by 1, but considering the nesting, it's clearer to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nIn any case, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and checking with a geometric series formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by computing each nested layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Okay, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me check that step again because maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that seems correct. Now, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nNow, multiply each part by 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as each layer being a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula as I did earlier.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each time you have 1 + 3*(something), it's similar to expanding a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is nested within the previous one.\n\nBut in this case, since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each layer step by step is feasible and less error-prone than trying to remember a complex formula.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1.

Let me check that: 29524 \u00d7 3. Yes, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial layers to see if it holds. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead me to the same result. I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the recurrence relation. 2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation. 4. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer, then multiply by 3. Both approaches confirm the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
