    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe this sequence can be modeled using a formula. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a good check because it confirms that both methods lead to the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*(121)=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*(364)=1 +1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9, then the total is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this formulaic approach confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, regardless of the method, the answer is consistent. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve it, let's find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me compute 29524*3 again: 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, correct. Alternatively, as I did earlier, digit by digit: 29524*3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, no, let's see: The digits are 2 (ten thousands place),9 (thousands),5 (hundreds),2 (tens),4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, writing the digits from right to left as we compute: units:2, tens:7, hundreds:5, thousands:8, ten thousands:8. So, the number is 88572. Correct. So, all my computations check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me define the layers more formally. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the original problem has nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote this as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. If I expand E, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1 + 3^{10}. Wait, let me see: When you have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) it's similar to E = 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*(...)) which is similar to E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} for n layers. Wait, but in our case, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each layer adds a 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps the expansion is a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to compute E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1s. Wait, actually, each layer adds another 3. Let me think. When you have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers, it's equivalent to E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n+1}. Wait, let me test with n=1: E=3*(1 +3)=3*4=12. But according to the sum, it would be 3 + 3^2=3+9=12. Correct. For n=2: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1+3*4)=3*(13)=39. According to the sum, 3 + 3^2 + 3^3=3+9+27=39. Correct. So, yes, the general formula for E with n layers is E=3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n+1}. Which is a geometric series with first term 3, ratio 3, and n+1 terms. The sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{k} -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r the ratio, and k the number of terms. Here, a=3, r=3, k=n+1. So, S = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. Wait, let me verify with n=1: S=(3^{3} -3)/2=(27-3)/2=24/2=12. Correct. For n=2: S=(3^4 -3)/2=(81-3)/2=78/2=39. Correct. So, for our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of 1+3(...). The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and since the innermost is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around, so the total number of layers is 9. Wait, let me count the number of 1+3 expressions: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3. So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc., up to 9 layers. Therefore, n=9. So, E=(3^{9+2} -3)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, but earlier when I computed using the layers, I got E=3*a_9=88572. Let me check if (3^{11} -3)/2 equals 88572. Compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, using the geometric series approach also gives me the same result, which is reassuring. So, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572. I think I'm confident now that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being 1 + 3 times the previous. Wait, let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's homogeneous, but with a constant term. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check the calculations again quickly. 3^{10}=59049, yes. 59049-1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step seems manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = a * 3^n + b, where a and b are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1). This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is Layer n = C * 3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say Layer n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C * 3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C * 3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * (3^(10) -1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation Layer \\( n = 1 + 3 \\times \\) (previous layer).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern in the layers. Let me see: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 = 3*(3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Hmm, so each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series up to 3^(n) where n is the layer number. For example, Layer 1: 3^1 + 1 = 4 Layer 2: 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 13 Layer 3: 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 40 Layer 4: 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 121 Wait, but that doesn't seem to hold because Layer 4 is 121, which is 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121. Correct. So, Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but wait, starting from 3^1? Wait, actually, Layer 1 is 4, which is 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1. But the sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k is 1 + 3 = 4. So yes, Layer 1 is the sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k. Similarly, Layer 2 is the sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Wait, but 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, but Layer 2 is 13, which is correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which matches. So, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. So, the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k is (3^(n+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it would be (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, then Layer 9 is (3^10 - 1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me check one more layer. Let's say Layer 5: 364. According to the formula, Layer 5 should be (3^6 - 1)/2. 3^6 is 729. So, (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I'm confident that my final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can directly compute the result without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3, we arrive at the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Let me think about the layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3 + B = 4. Now, for n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 13. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B =13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): 6A =9 => A= 9/6= 3/2. Then, from equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B =4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 -9/2= -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this without expanding each layer, by recognizing the pattern earlier. But since I already did it both ways, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer to see if the pattern holds. Let me compute Layer 4 again: Layer 4=1 +3*Layer3=1+3*40=1+120=121. Using the formula: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works, and thus I can be certain that Layer 9 is 29524, leading to the final result of 88572. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, that seems correct. Hmm, but wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. Let's try to find a recurrence relation. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it directly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be thought of as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, a_2=1 +3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1} for n >=2, with a_1=4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Each step follows logically, and both the iterative computation and the recurrence relation approach led to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, it's a nested expression with each layer being 1 + 3 times the next layer. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result for a_9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved some computation, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each step wasn't too bad. But for a larger number of layers, the recurrence relation approach would be more efficient. However, in this case, both methods led to the same result. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation approach, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next term})\\), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check one more time by computing a few layers using the formula. For example, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that's solid.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each layer from 1 to 9. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can also note that the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute it step by step: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572.

Wait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c =1, r=3. Let me check if that's the case. Yes, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, but actually, let's see. Wait, in our case, the first term is a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, etc. So, perhaps the general formula would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But a1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4. That's correct, as a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, as a3=40. So, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is a9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 /2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula. Since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we find that the innermost value progresses as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can express it recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. Then, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n >= 2, and a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, but earlier, when I computed layer 2, I got 13. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Wait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me clarify. Wait, in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then the next is 1 + 3*(13) = 40, and so on. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in terms of a_n, where n is the number of layers from the inside out, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. So, in this case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a closed-form formula, which could be useful for larger n, but in this case, since n=9, it's manageable to compute each step manually. Alternatively, solving the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1=4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can recognize a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, for such a linear recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (c/(k-1)) + (a_1 - c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1}. Let me check that. In this case, k = 3, c = 1. So the general solution would be a_n = (1/(3-1)) + (a_1 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} = (1/2) + (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} = (1/2) + (7/2) * 3^{n-1}. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (1/2) + (7/2)*3^{0} = 1/2 + 7/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (1/2) + (7/2)*3^{1} = 1/2 + (7/2)*3 = 1/2 + 21/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So maybe my formula is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conditions. Let me re-examine the recurrence. The problem is that a_1 is 4, which is the innermost term. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. But according to the formula I just used, a_2 should be 11, which is incorrect. So perhaps my approach to the general solution was wrong. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to compute a few terms using the recurrence and see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, up to a_9, which is 29524, as before. Now, let's see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as we calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same final value.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, since it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - c/(1 - r). Wait, but let me check. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the formula gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute the layers again without using the formula, just step by step, to see if I get the same result. Starting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1 +12=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can write this as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's unroll this recurrence: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So that's the same as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 +3*a2, etc., up to a9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9= (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or some kind of recursive relation. Let me see if there's a formula for this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3 =1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. So, in general, a_{n} =1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (k^{n} -1)/(k -1) *c + something. Wait, no, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Wait, maybe I can solve it more carefully. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 =4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n =3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the equation: C =3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

So 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this formula works for the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1=4. The solution we found is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 =729 -1=728/2=364. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the formula is correct. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this expression using the formula without expanding each layer. Since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern. Wait, each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, maybe this is a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, a_2=1 +3*a1=13, a3=1+3*a2=40, etc. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n, which would save time instead of computing each layer manually. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: a1= C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C -1/2 =4. So, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a9, we have a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where:\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's another way to approach it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, this recurrence relation is a linear one, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. But regardless, using the recurrence relation method gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This process is repeated 9 times, resulting in the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >1. Then, the layers go up to L_9, and the total expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B = 4.\n\nAlso, for n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging into the general solution: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plug A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if that's the case. Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's consistent. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but wait, actually, let me recall the standard approach. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation like a_n - r*a_{n-1} = c, the solution is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, where r is the root of the characteristic equation. The particular solution, since c is a constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Now, using the initial condition to find A. Let's apply this to our problem. Here, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so r=3, c=1. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term).

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_2 =1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on, up to a_9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=88572. So, the approach I took earlier is correct. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B =1 +3*B => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1= A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A -1/2 =4. Therefore, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might save time in case I have to compute a similar expression with more layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, in general, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I could have kept computing each layer step by step, as I did initially, which also led me to the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let's count how many times 1+3 is nested. The expression after the first 3 is (1+3(...)), and each time we have another (1+3(...)). Let me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: because the original expression has nine layers. Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I should check the number of layers again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1+3 starts a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's (1+3). Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so from inner to outer, we have:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\nLayer4: (1+3(Layer3))\nLayer5: (1+3(Layer4))\nLayer6: (1+3(Layer5))\nLayer7: (1+3(Layer6))\nLayer8: (1+3(Layer7))\nLayer9: (1+3(Layer8))\nWait, but in the original expression, after the initial 3, it's (1+3(...)), which would be Layer9. So, actually, I think I may have miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1+3 starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then, each time we go out, we have another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1+3 is used. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), so that's layer 1.\n\n- Then, moving out, each (1+3(...)) is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\n\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\n\nLayer4: (1+3(Layer3))\n\nLayer5: (1+3(Layer4))\n\nLayer6: (1+3(Layer5))\n\nLayer7: (1+3(Layer6))\n\nLayer8: (1+3(Layer7))\n\nLayer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nAnd then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I think my initial calculation was correct, with 9 layers, ending up with Layer9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation of each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be expressed recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, a_1 would actually be 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nWait, that seems odd because our terms are positive and increasing. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check: The particular solution approach for a constant forcing function. So, if we assume a particular solution is a constant, then a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSo, a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that's negative, but our sequence is positive. Maybe that's okay because the homogeneous solution will dominate.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88572 as the answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3n1, etc., up to n9. So, in general, each term is n_k = 1 + 3n_{k-1}, with n1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for n_k. The recurrence is n_k = 3n_{k-1} + 1, with n1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is n_k - 3n_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say n_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is n_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When k=1, n1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with k=1: n1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: n2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: n3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, n9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, n9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, n9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*n9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express it using the formula, since n9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3, so perhaps we can model this as a geometric series where each term is 3^n, starting from n=0 up to n=9. Wait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant particular solution, say a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C - 1/2 => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4. Then each layer adds 1 +3*previous. After 9 layers, we get 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Yes, that seems solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the outermost layer is a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is linear, so it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let's consider a simpler version first. Suppose we have 3*(1 + 3). That would be 3*(4) = 12. If we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), that's 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. Then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(40) = 120. Wait a minute, so the results so far are 12, 39, 120, 364, 1093, etc. Each time, it seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1 or something. Alternatively, perhaps each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, the sequence is a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute this without working through each layer, I could use the formula for a_n and then multiply by 3. Since a9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(previous result), and so on up to 9 layers. 3. After computing the innermost 9 layers, multiply the result by 3. 4. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and solve it using the formula for a geometric series, which gives the same result. Both methods lead to the same final answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula instead of computing each term step by step. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this, I can recognize it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572.

    "text": ". That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, 29400 + 120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous term. To solve this recursion, we can find a closed-form expression. The general form of such a recursion is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is when L_n = b*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*b^n. Then, we find a particular solution, which in this case is a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution L_p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recursion: K = a + b*K. Solving for K: K - b*K = a => K(1 - b) = a => K = a/(1 - b). In our case, a = 1 and b = 3, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it in multiple ways: computing each layer step by step, and then using a recursive formula to find the closed-form solution. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a recursive formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's the correct approach, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), it's doable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern and using the formula makes it much quicker, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine, step-by-step computation works fine. I guess the key takeaway here is that when faced with nested expressions like this, especially with a repeating pattern, it's helpful to look for a recurrence relation or a pattern that can be generalized. That way, you can avoid computing each layer manually, which can save time and reduce the chance of errors. But in this problem, since the number isn't too large, computing each layer step by step is feasible. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.
