Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient and less error-prone, especially if the number of layers is larger. Let me think about this. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's assume L(n) = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B => Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n, and 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, when n=1, L(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 *29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods led me to the same result, and I double-checked each step. So, yeah, that's how I solved it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from L1=4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. It might be possible to find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the value of the innermost expression is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer, which is the 9th layer, we compute \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series but not exactly because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've double-checked my work enough times, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D =1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, but let me check: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4, which is a_1=4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=1 +3*a_1=13, and so on up to Layer 9, which would be a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Looking at these numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Hmm, is there a pattern here? Let me see the ratios between consecutive terms. 13/4=3.25, 40/13\u22483.077, 121/40\u22483.025, 364/121\u22483.008, 1093/364\u22483.000, 3280/1093\u22483.000, 9841/3280\u22483.000, 29524/9841\u22483.000. So, each term is approximately 3 times the previous term, approaching 3 as the number of layers increases. So, it's like each layer is 3 times the previous layer, minus something. Wait, but in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I think of it as a recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3L(n-1) = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's see, when n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, using the formula, it's 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and it's homogeneous but non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, but using the formula makes it much faster, especially for multiple layers. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r-1)) + (a_1 - c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1}. Let me plug in the values: c=1, r=3, a_1=4. So, a_n = (1/(3-1)) + (4 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} = (1/2) + (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} = (1/2) + (7/2) * 3^{n-1}. Therefore, a_n = (1 + 7*3^{n-1}) / 2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (1 + 7*3^{0}) / 2 = (1 + 7*1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (1 + 7*3^{1}) / 2 = (1 + 21)/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, maybe my general formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in deriving the formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the terms are growing exponentially, which makes sense because of the multiplicative factor of 3 each time. To find a closed-form solution, we can consider solving the recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1} - c/(r-1). Let me apply that here. Here, r=3, c=1. So, the general solution is a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Plugging in a_1=4: a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute this for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^8. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = Let's compute 6561*9: 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 +9=59049. So, 9*6561=59049. Then, (9/2)*6561 = 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Then, a_9 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, that matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try expanding it step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) Let's see how many terms we have. Each time we expand, we get one more term. But in this case, since there are nine layers, it's a finite series. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let's try to write this out without parentheses: E = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, no, actually, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the number of terms might not be nine. Let me think. Each time we expand a layer, we're adding another term. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the total expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I expand it, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine layers. Wait, but in our case, each layer corresponds to one additional multiplication by 3. So, the total expression would be a sum of terms where each term is 3^k, where k starts from 1 up to 9. Wait, let me check. Let me consider the innermost term: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 9 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 27 + 9 = 40. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, each layer is just adding another term of 3^n, where n increases each time. Wait, perhaps the total expression can be written as a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=9, but let me check.\n\nWait, when I expand E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), each time I expand a layer, I get an additional term. So, if there are nine layers, then the expansion would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1. So, E = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683. Wait, but that would be a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9. The sum S of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Here, a=3, r=3, n=9. So, S = 3*(3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 = 29523. But wait, earlier we found that the outermost layer before multiplying by 3 is 29524, which is 29523 +1. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the sum S = 29523, and then the entire expression is 3*(S +1) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to align. Therefore, another way to compute this is to recognize that the nested expression inside the outermost 3 is a geometric series sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k, which is 29523, then add 1, and multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, since the expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which is 1 + 3*S', where S' is the sum from k=1 to k=8 of 3^k. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me just stick to the step-by-step computation since that worked earlier and I arrived at a consistent answer. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, I found that each layer's value is as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3,... up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as starting from 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then using the formula, it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. That confirms the result again. So, no matter which method I use, I get 88572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 +600=9600 +240=9840 +0=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841. Correct.

So, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually seems manageable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps? Let me recall: The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, I computed each layer step by step, then used the recurrence relation to find a formula, and confirmed that both methods give the same result. That gives me confidence that I didn't make a mistake in the manual computations. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, the general formula for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach lead to the same result.

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc., each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*L_prev. This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1, L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4, L4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each time, we have 1 + 3*next_layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the entire expression is 3 times the 9th layer, which we found to be 29524, leading to 88572. So, I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer is indeed 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the multiplication. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n----------\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom, we have 8,8,5,7,2. So 88,572. Yep, that's correct.

So that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, is that true? Let me check. Let me see, for n=1, L1=4. If I plug n=1 into (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But L1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my general formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different form. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. Let me compute the first few terms: L1=4 L2=1 +3*4=13 L3=1 +3*13=40 L4=1 +3*40=121 L5=1 +3*121=364 L6=1 +3*364=1093 L7=1 +3*1093=3280 L8=1 +3*3280=9841 L9=1 +3*9841=29524 So, indeed, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be written as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)}=A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me see how many layers there are. Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, that's nine layers. So, the expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is as computed. Therefore, using the formula, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a shortcut instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. But since I already have a formula, it's efficient to use that. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L1 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That is, each term is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive expression. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems like a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. So, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, L_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, same result.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assuming a_n = D, then substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. That's the same as Layer 9. So, yes, the formula gives the same result as computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds upon the previous one, and using both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result, which is reassuring. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Suppose I have a sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let's see: Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem using both methods to ensure consistency. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, 3 layers. Compute innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. Then 1+3*13=40. Then 3*40=120. Alternatively, using the formula, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. Then 3*a_3=120. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer for the original problem is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then, subtract (30000 - 29524) = 476. So, 3 * 476 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, this seems like each term is following a pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer using the formula. a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 =4. a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=13. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=40. a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=121. a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=364. a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093. a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280. a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841. a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. So, everything checks out. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, which would have saved time, especially if the expression had more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. Just needed to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid mistakes. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to check out, both by iterative computation and by using the closed-form formula. So, yeah, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which seems like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series to confirm. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. To find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, let's consider the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems solid. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n =3*a_{n-1}+1, and since this is a geometric progression, it's easier to compute using the formula. But since I already computed each layer step by step and confirmed with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the ninth layer, which equals 29524.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, as that might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Starting from the innermost term: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression might give me a geometric series. Let me try to expand it step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write out the layers:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, as before, so E = 3*a_9, where a_9 is the outermost layer. But maybe I can expand E step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3*1 + 3*3*a_8 = 3 + 9*a_8\n\nSimilarly, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7, so:\n\nE = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*a_7) = 3 + 9 + 27*a_7 = 12 + 27*a_7\n\na_7 =1 +3*a6, so:\n\nE =12 +27*(1 +3*a6)=12 +27 +81*a6=39 +81*a6\n\na6=1 +3*a5:\n\nE=39 +81*(1 +3*a5)=39 +81 +243*a5=120 +243*a5\n\na5=1 +3*a4:\n\nE=120 +243*(1 +3*a4)=120 +243 +729*a4=363 +729*a4\n\na4=1 +3*a3:\n\nE=363 +729*(1 +3*a3)=363 +729 +2187*a3=1092 +2187*a3\n\na3=1 +3*a2:\n\nE=1092 +2187*(1 +3*a2)=1092 +2187 +6561*a2=3279 +6561*a2\n\na2=1 +3*a1:\n\nE=3279 +6561*(1 +3*a1)=3279 +6561 +19683*a1=9840 +19683*a1\n\na1=1 +3:\n\nE=9840 +19683*(4)=9840 +78732=88572\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it by expanding each term. Either way, I end up with 88572. I think I'm confident that the answer is correct. To double-check, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). Let me compute the innermost part first: 1 +3=4. Then moving out: 1 +3*4=13. Then:1 +3*13=40. Then:1 +3*40=121. Then:1 +3*121=364. Then:1 +3*364=1093. Then:1 +3*1093=3280. Then:1 +3*3280=9841. Then:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent with all previous calculations. I think I can be sure that 88572 is the correct answer. It's always good to check using different methods to ensure that the result is accurate. In this case, both the step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation gave the same result, which adds to my confidence. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let me plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute step by step, or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula derived from this recurrence relation, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we compute the 9th layer as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting with 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 13\n   - Layer 3: 40\n   - Layer 4: 121\n   - Layer 5: 364\n   - Layer 6: 1093\n   - Layer 7: 3280\n   - Layer 8: 9841\n   - Layer 9: 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed. For n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is L9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, for example, if the expression was just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That would be three layers. Let's compute that manually. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, computing step by step: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(39 + 1) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's different from my initial approach. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let's do it step by step. Let me compute the innermost parentheses first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(40) = 120. Wait, so in this smaller example, the result is 120. But if I compute it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), that's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So my method works for this smaller case. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should give the correct result. So, I think 88572 is the right answer. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually. Let's take the original problem but with one less layer. So, if the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))). That is, eight layers instead of nine. Let me compute that. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, the outermost layer is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, so with eight layers inside, the result is 29523. Then, in the original problem, we have nine layers inside, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent.

Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the general formula, I end up with the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the approach I took is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps there's a geometric series or a recursive formula that can be applied here. Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. Now, looking at the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Let's assume L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(4) =13. Then, 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. I think that's solid. Maybe I can also think of this as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me recall that for an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )), it can be represented as a geometric series. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first term is 1, the next term is 3*1, the next term is 3^2*1, and so on, up to 3^{n-1}*1. But wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand it all the way, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, expanding all layers, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1. So, the total sum is the sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k, which is (3^n -1)/2. Wait, that's exactly what we had earlier with the recurrence relation. So, for n layers, the value is (3^n -1)/2. But in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9, which gives (3^9 -1)/2. Wait, but earlier we had a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, let's clarify. When we started with layer 1 as 1 + 3, that's 3^1 +1. But in the formula, we have (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for layer n. So, if we have 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, as we had. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked it using multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series formula. All approaches lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression, which might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I can find a recursive formula here. Let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers I computed. L1: 4, L2:13, L3:40, L4:121, L5:364, L6:1093, L7:3280, L8:9841, L9:29524. Let me see if each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let's check: L2 = 3*L1 + 1? 3*4 +1 =13. Correct. L3=3*L2 +1=3*13 +1=40. Correct. L4=3*40 +1=121. Correct. L5=3*121 +1=364. Correct. L6=3*364 +1=1093. Correct. L7=3*1093 +1=3280. Correct. L8=3*3280 +1=9841. Correct. L9=3*9841 +1=29524. Correct. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems to hold. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation where L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for such linear recurrences, the solution can be found using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - a*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - a = 0, so r = a. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*a^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (b), we can assume a constant solution L_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K. Applying initial conditions to find C. Let's apply this to our problem. Here, a = 3, b = 1. So, the particular solution K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Therefore, L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.

Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values we have. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
