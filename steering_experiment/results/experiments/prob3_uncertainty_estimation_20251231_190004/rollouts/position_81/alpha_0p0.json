Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is defined recursively. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear recursions. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. Wait, let me check: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be written as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, a = 3, b = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3 multiplied by a geometric series. Let me see: The expression inside the first 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to the sum of a geometric series. The sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Because each time we're multiplying by 3, and there are 9 layers, so the exponents go from 0 to 8. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Here, r=3, n=9. So, S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier, we had L_9 = 29524, which is 3*(9841). Wait, so perhaps I'm confusing the layers here. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, up to 9 layers, which gives L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, it's equivalent to 3*(L_9). So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. Either way, I get the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Perfect. So, I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12=13, L3=1 + 3*L2=1 + 39=40, and so on. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n >= 2, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation. Let's see. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3r, which seems off. Wait, perhaps better to write it as Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln = A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if I expand it, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 -1)/2, as we saw. Similarly, L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = (3^3 -1)/2. Wait, that's the same as the formula we derived earlier. So, indeed, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*L9=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check 29524*3 again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer corresponds to a term in this sequence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9, which we computed as 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponents directly. Since each layer is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it again. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or compute it directly using exponents, I get the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(the previous term). This seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation. Let a_n be the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing the pattern earlier could have saved time, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable, albeit a bit time-consuming. But it's good to know that both methods give the same result, which adds confidence in the correctness of the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost expression:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on. This is a geometric series in disguise? Let me think. Each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is known. For a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, starting from L1=4, then L2=13, L3=40, etc. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we've already computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems solid. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=4, and a_{n}=1 +3*a_{n-1}, then this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 +3*C => C -3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer1: a1=4, which is (3^{2}-1)/2=4. Then, each subsequent layer is built on top of that. So, the outermost layer, which is Layer9, would be a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Because n=9, so a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me see if I can express E in terms of a_n. Since E=3*a9, and a9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so E=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=3*59049=177147. Therefore, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Let me think about this expression: It's a repeated multiplication where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9, since the outermost layer is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. First, let's find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we got earlier. So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't want to use the formula, I could recognize that each a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 is (3^10 -1)/2, which is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Either way, I get the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This expression seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. So, plug in n=1: 4 = A*3 + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, if the recurrence were to continue indefinitely, the term would approach a limit L, such that L = 1 + 3*L, which gives L = -0.5. But in our case, we have a finite number of layers, so maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a_n can be found as follows. Since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can expand this recursively: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_1. Since a_1 = 4, this becomes a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/ (3 - 1) + 3^{n}*4. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 4*3^{n} = (3^{n} -1 + 8*3^{n}) /2 = (9*3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging n=1: (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Wait, that's not 4. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the derivation. Let me try again. Starting with the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern. a1=4, a2=1 +3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, etc. Let me see if I can find a pattern. The terms seem to be 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, etc. Let me see the ratio between consecutive terms: 13/4=3.25, 40/13\u22483.077, 121/40\u22483.025, 364/121\u22483.008. So, approaching 3 as n increases. That suggests that the closed-form might involve 3^{n} terms. Let me try solving the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r=3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer)+1. The outermost layer is a_9, since there are nine layers from the innermost to the outermost. Wait, let me count the layers again. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Each set of parentheses corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, up to a_9. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since it's nested, the step-by-step computation was manageable, especially since there are only nine layers. It's interesting how the closed-form formula using the recurrence relation gives the same result without having to compute each layer individually. But since the number of layers is manageable, both methods work well. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a linear recurrence relation of the first order, we can solve it using iteration or find a closed-form formula. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what we computed. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I need to check if that applies here. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. So, in our case, r = 3, c = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, at n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Because a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives us the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each step is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, it's a bit different because each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would involve finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 +3=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p =3*a_p +1 => a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, which is correct because a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, 88572.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe L_0 would be 1? Let me check. If n=1, L_1 = 4 = 3*L_0 + 1. So, 4 = 3*L_0 + 1 => 3*L_0 = 3 => L_0 = 1. So, yes, L_0 = 1. Then, the general formula would be L_n = 3^n * L_0 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * 1 + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach lead to the same result.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C +1. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.

Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer. The expression is a nested multiplication, so it's like a repeated process. Let me denote the innermost expression as a1, then a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on up to a9, and then the total expression is 3*a9. So, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1 = 4. When n=1, a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...).

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there are 9 layers. Wait, but when I labeled them, I started from Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1+3, and Layer 9 as the outermost. So, that's 9 layers. But when I computed, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to follow a pattern where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 +1=13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) and 9A + B =13 (from n=2). Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 =>6A=9 =>A=9/6=3/2. Now, substituting A=3/2 into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B=4 =>9/2 + B=4 =>B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Because n=9: L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Wait, but in each step, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. Suppose a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. So for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. So, to recap, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I found a formula that allows me to compute each layer directly without having to calculate each one step by step, which would be time-consuming, especially for more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. It's good to know the recurrence relation method in case the number of layers is larger, as it can save a lot of time. Alternatively, I could also think of this as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in certain number systems, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. Anyway, after computing each layer up to the ninth one, I found that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives me the final result of 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using a formula. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general formula for such a linear recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me plug in the values: Here, c = 1, k = 3, a_1 = 4. So, a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying, a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (9/2) * 3^{8} - 1/2. Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute that. 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 +9=59049. So, 9*6561=59049. Then, (59049)/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. Therefore, the final answer is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. If I expand it, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I need to check how many terms there are. Wait, actually, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1s. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps it's a geometric series with ratio 3 and nine terms. Wait, let me try to see: Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, since I've already computed it step by step and using the recurrence relation, and both give me 88572, I can be confident that the answer is correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^n - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check. Actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). In our case, c = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, but our recurrence starts at a_1. Let me adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 as the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so a_0 = 4. Then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. So, using the formula: a_n = 3^{n+1} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, let me make sure. The general solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, no, more precisely, for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, the recurrence starts at a_0, so a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, for n steps, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Since d = 1, the formula becomes a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Plugging in a_0 = 4, we get a_n = 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me compute this for n=9, since we have nine layers beyond the initial a_0. Wait, no. Let's clarify: a_0 is the innermost layer, so a_1 is the next layer out, up to a_9 being the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So, the total number of layers is 9, starting from a_0 to a_9. So, n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = 4*3^9 + (3^9 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^9 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, 3^9 = 19683. Now, a_9 = 4*19683 + (19683 - 1)/2. Compute each part: 4*19683: Let's compute 19683 * 4. 19683 * 2 = 39366, so 39366 * 2 = 78732. So, 4*19683 = 78732.\n\nNext, (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573. Wait, that's different from our earlier result of 29524. Hmm, this suggests a problem. Because when I computed layer by layer, I got a_9 as 29524, but using the formula, I get 88573. There must be a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the formula for the recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, a_0 is the initial term, which is 4. Then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, for n steps, the formula should be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, but when I plug n=9, I get a_9 = 3^9 *4 + (3^9 -1)/2 = 19683*4 + (19683 -1)/2 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573.\n\nBut when I computed layer by layer, I had a_9 = 29524. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in either the layer-by-layer computation or in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let's go back to the layer-by-layer computation. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nWait, so a_9 is 29524. But according to the formula, it's 88573. So, clearly, I'm applying the formula incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here because the recurrence starts at a_0, but in our problem, the total number of layers is 9, which might correspond to n=8 in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n represents the nth term after the initial a_0. So, if I have 9 layers, starting from a_0 to a_9, then n=9. But in my layer-by-layer computation, a_9 is 29524, whereas the formula gives 88573. There's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let's see: The formula is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = 3^9 *4 + (3^9 -1)/2 = 19683*4 + 19682/2 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, a_9 is 29524. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... Up to nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is nine. Therefore, a_0 = 4, a_1 =13, a_2=40, ..., a_9=29524.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 should be 88573. But that's not matching. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here because the formula gives a_n as the term after n steps starting from a_0, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524=88572, which is one less than the formula's result. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the formula. Let me re-examine the formula.\n\nThe standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c -1).\n\nIn our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_0=4.\n\nSo, a_n = 3^{n} *4 + (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) = 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 =4*19683 + (19683 -1)/2 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, a_9=29524.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step, I computed a_9 as 29524, which is the value before multiplying by 3. Wait, no, in the step-by-step, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9=88573, which is one more than 88572. So, there's a discrepancy of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the formula gives a_n as the term after n steps, but in our problem, we have n=9 layers, but perhaps the formula is giving a_{10} instead? Let me see.\n\nWait, if I set a_0=4, then a_1=13, a_2=40, a_3=121, a_4=364, a_5=1093, a_6=3280, a_7=9841, a_8=29524, a_9=88573.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had a_9=29524, which is actually a_8 in the formula. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Each time, it's a new layer. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n\nWait, that's nine layers. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: 1+3(layer1), up to layer9: 1+3(layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, in the formula, a_0=4, a_1=13, a_2=40, a_3=121, a_4=364, a_5=1093, a_6=3280, a_7=9841, a_8=29524, a_9=88573.\n\nBut in our step-by-step, we have a_9=29524, which corresponds to a_8 in the formula. Therefore, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see.\n\nIf the innermost layer is a_0=4, then the first layer out is a_1=13, and so on, up to a_9=88573. But in the problem, the expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is a_9=29524, as computed step-by-step. So, in that case, the formula is giving a_9=88573, but in reality, according to the step-by-step, a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=88573, which is one more than 88572. So, perhaps the formula is correct, and I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step computation again, layer by layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that's correct. So, a_9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=88573. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is giving the term after n steps, but in our problem, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is giving the value of the entire expression, not just a_9. Let me see.\n\nWait, the formula gives a_n=88573 for n=9, but the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524=88572, which is one less than 88573. So, perhaps the formula is slightly off because in the formula, a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as our layers, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, whereas in the formula, a_n is the term after n steps, which would correspond to the innermost layer being a_0, and the outermost being a_9, which is 88573, but then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*88573=265719, which is way too big. That can't be right.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the expression step by step again, but this time, I'll write down each layer and see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=88573, which is one more than this. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect, or perhaps I misapplied it.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again.\n\nThe standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is:\n\na_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nIn our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, a_0=4.\n\nSo, a_n = 3^{n}*4 + (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) = 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=9:\n\na_9 =4*19683 + (19683 -1)/2 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, where is the mistake? It seems that the formula is giving a_9=88573, but in reality, the step-by-step gives a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the term after n steps, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is one step beyond a_9. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n represents the term after n steps starting from a_0. So, if we have nine layers, starting from a_0=4, then a_9=88573. But in our problem, the expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*88573=265719, which is way larger than what we have. So, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the initial term is a_0=4, but in our problem, the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me try to express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since there are nine layers, it's not recursive in the same way as an infinite series. So, perhaps the formula approach is not the best here, and the step-by-step computation is more reliable.\n\nGiven that, and that I've computed each layer step-by-step and arrived at 88572, perhaps that is the correct answer, and the formula was misapplied because I confused the number of layers or the starting point.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the step-by-step computation, which gives me 88572 as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. The final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it in homogeneous form. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D => C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*(59048)/2= (3*59048)/2. Compute 3*59048: 59048*3. Let's compute 59048*3: 50000*3=150000, 9000*3=27000, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 150000 +27000=177000, +120=177120, +24=177144. Now, divide by 2: 177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked with a formula, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Wait, let me think: Each time, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). If we expand this, it's like 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. But wait, actually, each layer adds another power of 3. So, the total expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, multiplied by 3. Wait, no, let me see. Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the inner expression is similar to E but without the outermost 3. Wait, no, actually, each layer is similar but with one less multiplication by 3. Maybe I can model it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 121 And so on. So, each layer n adds 3^{n}. So, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. That's a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, ratio 3. The sum of a geometric series is (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier we had Layer 9 as 29524. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the layers here. Wait, in my initial computation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), where Layer 8 was 9841. Wait, but if Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841=29524, which is 1 + 3^9 + 3^8 + ... + 3^1? Wait, no, because 3^9 is 19683, and 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 is (3^9 -1)/2=9841. So, 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, actually, the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the inner part is 9841, so E=3*29524=88572. Wait, but if I think of E as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 )= 3*(9841)=29523. But in reality, the inner expression is 1 + 3*(...), which is 9841, so E=3*9841=29523, but wait, that's not matching my earlier computation where E was 3*(29524)=88572. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3=4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, E=3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I think of each layer as adding another power of 3, starting from the innermost, then Layer 1 is 1 + 3=4=1 +3^1. Layer 2 is 1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13=1 +3 +3^2. Layer 3 is 1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3. And so on, up to Layer 9, which would be 1 +3 +3^2 +... +3^8= (3^9 -1)/2=9841. But wait, in my earlier step-by-step computation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 +3*9841=29524. So, that suggests that Layer 9 is 1 +3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k)=1 +3*(9841)=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the confusion arises because the inner expression is 9841, which is the sum up to 3^8, and then Layer 9 is 1 +3*9841=29524, and then E=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer adds another term in the geometric series, but with a multiplier outside. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) which can be expressed as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) up to 9 layers. But in the end, the step-by-step computation seems to be the most straightforward way, even though it's a bit tedious. So, to recap: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2:13 Layer 3:40 Layer 4:121 Layer 5:364 Layer 6:1093 Layer 7:3280 Layer 8:9841 Layer 9:29524 Then, multiply by 3: 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also confirmed that Layer 9 is 29524, leading to the final answer of 88572. So, I'm confident that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right-hand side: 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can find A using the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This looks like a recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it might have a closed-form solution. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The general form is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression. The solution is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + L0*(r^{n}) if L0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L1 = 4, and each subsequent term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L1, which is 4, and each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me see if I can express this as a geometric series. Let's write out the first few terms: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2, with L1 = 4. To find a closed-form formula, let's consider solving the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^{3})/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln where n is the layer number. Let's define Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved as such. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this to find a pattern or a formula. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3=40, etc., as I computed before. Alternatively, this recurrence can be represented as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for L(n). Let me try that. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough. I checked each layer, then found a formula, and both methods led me to the same answer.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only 9, it wasn't too bad. Another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. But in this case, since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1, the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is evaluated step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, confirming the result efficiently.

So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent each term. Let me see if these numbers follow a geometric progression or some other sequence. Let's compute the ratio between consecutive terms: L2 / L1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25. L3 / L2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077. L4 / L3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025. L5 / L4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008. L6 / L5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000. L7 / L6 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000. Hmm, it seems like each term is approximately 3 times the previous one, but slightly more. But as we go further, the ratio approaches 3. Maybe this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's exactly the case here. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's find A and B. We know that L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_p(n) = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we have. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, this would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. \n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series or something else. Let's see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, as before. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (1/2)*(3^{n+1} -1). Let me check that. For n=1: a_1 = (1/2)*(3^2 -1) = (1/2)*(9 -1) = (1/2)*8=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (1/2)*(3^3 -1) = (1/2)*(27 -1)= (1/2)*26=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (1/2)*(3^4 -1)= (1/2)*(81 -1)= (1/2)*80=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, from layer 1 to layer 9, but wait, in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 is the innermost expression? Wait, no, actually, let's see. Wait, the original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer wraps around, so layer 9 would be the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, with layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). So, 3*( (59049 -1)/2 )= 3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to look at it. But regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. I think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the problem has nine layers, maybe it's quicker to compute each step. Wait, let me check if each layer is indeed computed correctly. Let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer1: 4, Layer2: 13, Layer3: 40, Layer4: 121, Layer5: 364, Layer6: 1093, Layer7: 3280, Layer8: 9841, Layer9: 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., then it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), step-by-step computation is feasible. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. Here, a=3, b=1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). So in this case, a=3, b=1, so L_n = C*3^n + (1/(3-1)) = C*3^n + 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = C*3^1 + 1/2 = 3C + 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2, so C = 7/6. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: L_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had L_2 =13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the formula. Wait, let me double-check. The standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = (L_1 - b/(a-1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a-1). So, in this case, a=3, b=1. So, L_n = (L_1 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1) = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let's test for n=1: (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier computation gave L_2 as 13. So, that's a problem. Therefore, my general formula must be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see. Wait, perhaps the formula is L_n = (L_0 - b/(a-1)) * a^n + b/(a-1), where L_0 is the initial term. But in our case, L_1 is the first term. Maybe the indexing is off. Alternatively, perhaps I should index from n=0. Let me try that. Let me define L_0 = 1 + 3 = 4? Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, so L_0 would be undefined. Alternatively, maybe the formula is better applied starting from n=0. Let me try to adjust. Let me consider L_0 = 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, for n >=1, with L_0=1. Then, the general solution would be L_n = (L_0 - b/(a-1)) * a^n + b/(a-1). Here, a=3, b=1, L_0=1. So, L_n = (1 - 1/(3-1)) *3^n + 1/(3-1) = (1 - 1/2)*3^n + 1/2 = (1/2)*3^n + 1/2. Let's test n=1: (1/2)*3 + 1/2 = 3/2 + 1/2 = 4/2 = 2. But L_1 is supposed to be 4. So that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, starting from L_1=4. Then, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the step-by-step approach worked, and verifying with the general formula also gave the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a linear recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us a general formula, which we then apply to find the value of the outermost layer. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This pattern repeats nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - Final Answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
