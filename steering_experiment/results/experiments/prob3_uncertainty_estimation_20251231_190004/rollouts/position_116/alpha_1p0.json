Therefore, Layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Maybe a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So if I define a_0 = 1, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=1. Then using the general solution a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in n=0: a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B => A + B = 1. From earlier, we found B = -1/2. So A = 1 - B = 1 - (-1/2) = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, layer 1 was 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. So layer n corresponds to a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I still get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, for example, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each time, it's like a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But in this case, it's easier to compute each layer step by step since it's only 9 layers. So, to recap, I computed each layer from the inside out, each time substituting the value of the inner layer into the outer one. I got to the outermost layer, which was 29524, and then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I also verified this using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication step again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15.

Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": ". So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. But wait, in our case, how many layers do we have? Let me check the original expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if we have nine layers, then n=9? Or is it n=10? Wait, let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each time we add another 1 + 3*(...), so the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute that: 3^{10} = 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could say that the value after n layers is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and then multiply by 3 for the outermost factor. So, in this case, n=9, so (3^{10} -1)/2 *3 = (59049 -1)/2 *3 = 59048/2 *3 = 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524, then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all adds up. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we can determine each layer's value step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so multiply 29524 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation. That might have saved some time, especially if the number of layers were larger, but for 9 layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, then recognized the recurrence relation, solved it, and confirmed the result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I feel pretty sure about it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until reaching the outermost one. Multiplying this final value by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"
