    "text": " So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I might have made a mistake in the digit places. Let's write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct because 30000 * 3 is 90000, and 29524 is a bit less than 30000, so 88572 sounds plausible.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524: Let's add them:\n\n29524\n+29524\n--------\n?\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\n?\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me check that computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) is another layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time we have a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1+3(...). Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9, I correctly accounted for all layers. So, the computation seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWe can find the particular solution. Let's assume a constant solution, so a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, that gives 88572. Hmm, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. The expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that's nine layers. Wait, but when I started computing, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost (1+3), and then Layer 9 as the outermost. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the computation seems right, and the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds. For example, let's take a similar expression with fewer layers and see if the method works. Let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers. Compute innermost first: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Correct. Now, using the same method, if I compute the small example, I get 120, which is correct. So, applying the same method to the larger problem should be correct as well. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572  \n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, I must have messed up the digit places. Let me recount: 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, 2*3=6 in ten thousands place, 9*3=27 in thousands place, 5*3=15 in hundreds place, 2*3=6 in tens place, 4*3=12 in units place.

So, when I multiply by 3, it's 6*10000 + 27*1000 + 15*100 + 6*10 + 12*1. But when adding, I have to carry over properly. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- Multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right.\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28.

But according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. There's a conflict here. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572. But when adding 29524 three times, I get 88,572. That means there's a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, let me check 29524 * 3 using another approach. Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524) * 3. 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. So that confirms that the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? Let me check again:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, that would be 87,572, but that's not correct. So, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,572. But when I wrote it before, I thought it was 87,572. I must have misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, no, actually, 2 is in the units place, 7 in the tens, 5 in the hundreds, 8 in the thousands, and 8 in the ten thousands. So, it's 88,572. So, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was correct, but I misread it as 87,572 instead of 88,572. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nSo, going back, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each correctly computed. So, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 29,524 * 3 again using another method.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Use Layer 1 to compute Layer 2:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Use Layer 2 to compute Layer 3:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Use Layer 3 to compute Layer 4:\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Use Layer 4 to compute Layer 5:\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Use Layer 5 to compute Layer 6:\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Use Layer 6 to compute Layer 7:\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Use Layer 7 to compute Layer 8:\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Use Layer 8 to compute Layer 9:\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. Multiply Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result:\n    - 3*29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different from what I got before. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is less than 30000, so 29524 * 3 should be less than 90000. Wait, but 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Wait, that's different from my previous digit-by-digit calculation. So which one is correct? There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my digit-by-digit calculation again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the number is 8 (from 2*3+2) 8 (from 9*3+1) 5 (from 5*3) 7 (from 2*3+1) 2 (from 4*3). So, the number is 88572. Wait, that's different from what I thought before. Wait, in my initial digit-by-digit, I think I miscounted the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing from the last carry to the first digit: 8 (from ten-thousands), 8 (from thousands), 5 (from hundreds), 7 (from tens), 2 (from units). So, the number is 88572. That matches the other method where I broke it down as 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3, which totals 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12= 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. So, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I thought it was 87572, but that was a mistake in the digit places. The correct result is 88572. So, the correct final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure that I computed each layer correctly up to Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all the layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's the correct result. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down step by step, I was able to manage the complexity of the nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost and moving outward. After computing each layer, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, with an outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression forms a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, and so on. I notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. For n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Since there are nine layers, maybe there's a way to express E in terms of a geometric series. But given that each layer is built upon the previous one, and the formula we found earlier for L(n), perhaps it's more straightforward to use the recurrence relation. But since we've already computed it step by step and confirmed with the formula, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute E using the formula approach. Since E = 3*L9, and L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2, then E = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(L(n)\\) can be expressed as \\(L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(L(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, as before, a_9 = 29524. Then, the result is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this recursion as a geometric series. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c - 1))*(c)^{n-1} - d/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + m, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + m/(k - 1))*(k)^{n-1} - m/(k - 1). In this case, k=3 and m=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3 - 1))*(3)^{n-1} - 1/(3 - 1). Simplifying, that's a_n = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*(3)^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*(3)^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*(3)^8 - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^8: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561: 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, (9*6561) = 59049. Then, 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, as before. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches my earlier computation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous value). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. 1093 \u00d7 3: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9 \u2192 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. 3280 \u00d7 3: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. Wait, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80. So, 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. Adding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. Let me compute 9841 \u00d7 3. 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524: As before, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this without computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same answer without computing each layer step by step. That's a good check.\n\nWait, so the problem had 9 layers, right? From 1+3(...) up to 9 times. So, the innermost was 1+3, which was layer 1, and the outermost was layer 9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, both by computing each layer manually and by deriving the general formula for the nth layer. Both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step or by finding a general formula, we arrive at the same final result after multiplying by 3 at the end. It's interesting how the nested structure forms a geometric progression, allowing for a formulaic solution instead of computing each layer individually.\n\nI think I'm satisfied with this solution. It makes sense, and the checks I did along the way confirm that each step was correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 ... And so on. It seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} can be solved using standard techniques. Here, c = 1, r = 3. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is k - 3 = 0, so k = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression might lead to a geometric series. Let me try to expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) But since the structure repeats, the inner expression is similar to E/3, but not exactly. Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found a closed-form solution, perhaps it's better to stick with that. Either way, the answer seems consistent. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, this might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as above. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, yeah, that's how I would solve it.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a series. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - k)) * k^n + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. Let me apply the formula. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^h = A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution, assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me cross-verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me check the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but given that each layer is just 1 plus 3 times the previous, it might be a linear recurrence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, with n layers, the value would be a_n. Since there are nine layers inside the outermost 3, that would correspond to a_9, and then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.

Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, 7; carryover 0. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify this multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where in this case, r=3 and c=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, giving r=3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = A*3^n + K, and we found K = -1/2, then using a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute this without calculating each layer, I could have directly applied the formula for a_9 and then multiplied by 3. So, that's another way to approach it, especially if the number of layers is large, to avoid repetitive calculations.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, calculating each step by step was manageable. It's good to see that both methods give the same result, which increases my confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each term step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost term:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers to see if I get the same result. Let me try that. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that's consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Let me define L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 here.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1)), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*a^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). Wait, but in our case, a = 3, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L(9) =3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^11 is indeed 177147, and subtracting 3 gives 177144, which divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 sections:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which we've computed as 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about that. If each layer is defined by a recurrence relation, maybe I can model it as such. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can compute each L_n using this recurrence relation.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if it matches what I did before.\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so this recurrence seems correct. Now, if I have to compute up to L_9, then the value of the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nNow, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to find that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, and so the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can compute L_5 using the formula:\n\nL_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nSo, everything seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer:\n\\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\nEach subsequent layer is computed as:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1} \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- \\( L_1 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe value inside the outermost parentheses is \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). We then multiply this by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000; 9000 + 9000 = 18000; 500 + 500 = 1000; 20 + 20 = 40; 4 + 4 = 8. So, 40000 + 18000 = 58000; 58000 + 1000 = 59000; 59000 + 40 = 59040; 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute this: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 20 = 88568; 88568 + 4 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substitute back into a_1: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000 = 88048, +500 = 88548, +24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct).

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the nesting, it's plausible. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, I notice that each L is following a pattern: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1. In our case, the recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. So, k = 3, c = 1. Therefore, the solution would be L(n) = (L(1) - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let me compute that. First, L(1) = 4. Then, 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, L(n) = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). Simplify inside the first term: 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, L(n) = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Alternatively, factor out 1/2: L(n) = (1/2)*(9*3^{n-1} - 1). Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L(1) = (1/2)*(9*3^{0} - 1) = (1/2)*(9*1 - 1) = (1/2)*(8) = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (1/2)*(9*3^{1} - 1) = (1/2)*(27 - 1) = (1/2)*26 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (1/2)*(9*3^{2} - 1) = (1/2)*(81 - 1) = (1/2)*80 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (1/2)*(9*3^{3} - 1) = (1/2)*(243 - 1) = (1/2)*242 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L(9) = (1/2)*(9*3^{8} - 1). Let me compute 3^8 first. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8 = 6561. Then, 9*6561: Let's compute that. 9 * 6000 = 54000, 9*500 = 4500, 9*60 = 540, 9*1 = 9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500, +540 = 59040, +9 = 59049. So, 9*3^8 = 59049. Then, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, (1/2)*59048 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation for L(9). So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to see this. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and we have nine layers, maybe we can model this as a geometric series. Let me explore that. Let me consider the expression inside out. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1+3 terms. Wait, but each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps E can be expressed recursively as E = 3*(1 + 3*E'), where E' is the next layer. But since all layers are the same, except for the depth, perhaps this can be expressed as a geometric series. Wait, but each time, we have E = 3*(1 + 3*E'), but E' is similar to E but with one less layer. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation, and confirmed the result, maybe it's not necessary to go further. But just to check, let me try to express E as a sum. Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so expanding all the layers would result in a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Let me write out E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I expand all the terms, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))). Let me count how many terms there are. Each time, we have an additional power of 3. Let me see: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let's expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, when expanded, each layer contributes a term that's 3^k where k is the number of layers from the innermost. Wait, perhaps if I expand E, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me try to write this as a sum. Let me define E as: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me expand this expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Next, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Finally, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Alternatively, if I try to write E as a sum, each term would be 3^k for k from 0 to 8, but multiplied by some coefficients. Wait, let me see. Let me try to expand E without substituting each layer. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me expand step by step, replacing each innermost expression first. Let me denote each innermost expression as follows: Let me start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9 as before. Then, E = 3*L9, where L9 = 1 + 3*L8, and so on. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*1 + 3*3*L8 = 3 + 9*L8. Similarly, L8 = 1 + 3*L7, so E = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*L7) = 3 + 9 + 27*L7 = 12 + 27*L7. Continuing this way, each layer adds a term with a higher power of 3. Let me see how this progresses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer contributes a term that is 3^{n} where n is the number of layers from the innermost. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me try to write E as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) \n\nIf I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3^8)))\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Each time we have 1 + 3*something, which when expanded, becomes 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) and so on. So, expanding E, we get:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) \n\nLet me try to expand it step by step:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our previous calculations. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each time, we have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In our case, n=9. So, perhaps the general formula for E with n layers is E = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: If n=1, E = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Using the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, when n=1, the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 12. But according to the formula (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=1, it's (9 -1)/2=4, which is not 12. So, that formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. Each layer is of the form L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). We found earlier that L(n) = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (9*3^8 -1)/2 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, the formula for E would be 3*( (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2 ) = (27*3^{n-1} -3)/2 = (3^{n+3} -3)/2. Wait, let me check: 27 is 3^3, so 27*3^{n-1} = 3^{3 + n -1} = 3^{n+2}. Therefore, E = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. Let me test this for n=1: E should be 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Using the formula: (3^{1+2} -3)/2 = (27 -3)/2 = 24/2=12. Correct. For n=2: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13)=39. Using the formula: (3^{2+2} -3)/2 = (81 -3)/2=78/2=39. Correct. For n=3: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) = 3*(1 + 3*40)=3*121=363. Using the formula: (3^{3+2}-3)/2=(243 -3)/2=240/2=120. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, wait, no, for n=3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) = 3*(1 +3*40)=3*121=363. Using the formula: (3^{3+2} -3)/2=(243 -3)/2=240/2=120. Wait, that's not 363. So, my formula is incorrect. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in deriving it. Let me go back.\n\nWe had L(n) = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Then, E = 3*L(n) = 3*(9*3^{n-1} -1)/2 = (27*3^{n-1} -3)/2. Since 27 is 3^3, 27*3^{n-1} = 3^{3 + n -1} = 3^{n+2}. Therefore, E = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. But when n=3, E should be 363, but the formula gives (3^5 -3)/2 = (243 -3)/2=240/2=120, which is not 363. So, the formula is incorrect. Therefore, my initial assumption about the formula was wrong. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the expression as a geometric series. Let me think. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(something). If I expand all the terms, it would look like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand this fully, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps the expanded form is a sum of 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, when I expand E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))). Wait, but each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me try to see how many terms there are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that each layer is computed as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), and we've already computed L(9) = 29524, so E = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to compute a few layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3. 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did the digit-wise multiplication earlier, I got 87572, but when I broke it down, it's 88572. Let me check the digit-wise calculation again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2? Wait, no, that would be 87572, but the breakdown gave me 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So, units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext, 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext, 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572, not 87572. I think I made a mistake in the initial digit-wise calculation by misplacing the digits. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Let me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 8 + 4 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carryover 1.\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 (carryover) = 8.\n\nSo, total is 88572. That's consistent with the breakdown method. So, my initial digit-wise calculation had an error, but upon rechecking, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-wise multiplication earlier, I thought it was 87572, but now I see it's 88572. So, I must have miscounted the digits earlier. To avoid confusion, maybe I should just stick to the breakdown method since it's more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nSo, to recap: The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer's computation follows correctly from the previous one. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern here that could be generalized. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats multiple times, maybe there's a geometric series involved or a recursive formula.\n\nLet me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using methods for solving linear recursions.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. It's good to see that both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recurrence relation.\n3. Solve the recurrence relation to find a formula for the nth layer.\n4. Apply the formula for the 9th layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n5. Verify the result using both step-by-step computation and the formula to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns, applying recurrence relations, and verifying results through multiple methods. It also highlighted the importance of careful arithmetic to avoid mistakes, especially with larger numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 3:**\n   - The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).\n   - Compute \\(29524 \\times 3\\):\n     - Breakdown: \\(29524 \\times 3 = 88572\\)\n\n3. **Verification using recurrence relation:**\n   - The recurrence relation for each layer is \\(a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n   - The general solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Yep, that's consistent. So I think I did this correctly. It was a bit tedious, but by computing each layer step by step, I avoided getting lost in the complexity of the expression. I just took it one step at a time, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Each time, I computed the value of the current layer and used it in the next outer layer. It's like peeling an onion; each layer depends on the one inside it. This approach worked well because each layer was a simple multiplication and addition, so it wasn't too hard to manage. I could have tried to find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it was manageable to do it step by step. If there were, say, 20 layers, I might look for a recursive formula or a geometric series pattern, but here, nine steps are okay. Let me just recap the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or make a miscalculation: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all adds up. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric progression, but because each term is nested inside another, it compounds the growth. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is why the numbers get large so quickly. For example, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13 (which is 3*4 +1), Layer 3: 40 (3*13 +1), and so on. So, each term is following the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, starting from a_1=4. If I wanted to generalize this, I could solve the recurrence relation, but for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step was straightforward. I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for this kind of recurrence. Let me think. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, k=3 and c=1. So, the closed-form would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1). But in our case, a_1=4, so a_0 would be the term before that, which is 1 (since the innermost layer is 1+3=4). Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see. If I consider a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Perfect, that's exactly what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, using the closed-form formula, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. It's reassuring to see that both methods, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, lead to the same result. This problem is a good example of how recognizing a pattern or recurrence relation can simplify the computation, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, either method works fine. In summary, by carefully computing each layer from the inside out and verifying each step, I arrived at the solution of 88572. It's a bit of work, but methodical step-by-step computation ensures accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{...})\\).

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series, maybe? Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n} =1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm the outermost layer's value. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8.

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems more accurate. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10})/2 -1/2 ) = (3^{11})/2 - 3/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147)/2 - 3/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the final result efficiently. The solution is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems right. Alternatively, I can check the multiplication another way. Let me compute 29524 * 3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: Let's compute 29524 + 29524. 20000 + 20000 = 40000. 9000 + 9000 = 18000. 500 + 500 = 1000. 20 + 20 = 40. 4 + 4 = 8. Adding up: 40000 + 18000 = 58000. 58000 + 1000 = 59000. 59000 + 40 = 59040. 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute this: 50000 + 20000 = 70000. 9000 + 9000 = 18000. 400 + 500 = 900. 40 + 20 = 60. 8 + 4 = 12. Wait, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly. 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8.\n\nNo more digits, so the carryover 1 is added at the beginning.\n\nWait, but 59048 is a 5-digit number, and 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write them down:\n\n  59048\n+29524\n-------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5. Write 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the sum is 88572. That's the same as before. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if that's correct. a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, a9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a9, which is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. So, a9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can also verify that the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost term is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let me check that with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. Then another (1+3(...)) inside that. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: (1 + 3(Layer1)). Layer 3: (1 + 3(Layer2)), and so on, until Layer 9: (1 + 3(Layer8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, there are nine layers. So, my computation of nine layers is correct, leading to Layer9 being 29524, and the final result being 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. **Layer 2**: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n3. **Layer 3**: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n4. **Layer 4**: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n5. **Layer 5**: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n6. **Layer 6**: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n7. **Layer 7**: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n8. **Layer 8**: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n9. **Layer 9**: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.

Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and it's repeated multiple times, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1, and each outer layer increments n by 1. So, the outermost layer would be a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can see that it's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern that fits a linear recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This can be modeled using a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent each layer, starting from the innermost.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. I could also write a general formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), with n layers. In this case, a=1 and b=3, with n=9. The expression can be represented recursively as E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). Let's see if that holds with the layers I computed: E(1) = 4, E(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, in general, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1, with E(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E(n) = 3*E(n-1), whose solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say E_p. Plugging into the recurrence: E_p = 3*E_p + 1 => E_p - 3*E_p = 1 => -2*E_p = 1 => E_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition E(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, E(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, E(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I still get the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly and then use the formula. Since 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, E(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That makes me feel confident that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. I think I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, I think that's the correct answer. But wait, just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again to see if I missed a step. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which could save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, I can express it as a geometric series. Let's try that. Let me write the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's expand a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 (Wait, no, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1. But in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, so that's a_1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost expression equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the first one, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's substitute the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^{n} + B. Right side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since there are nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
