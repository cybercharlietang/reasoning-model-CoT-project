    "text": " So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming, and it's easy to make a mistake. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me analyze the structure. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern. We have a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, I already computed it step by step, but maybe I can model this recurrence relation as a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern or a formula. a_1 = 4 = (3^1) + 1. Wait, 3^1=3, 3+1=4. a_2 = 13. Let's see: 3^2=9, 9 + 4 =13. a_3=40. 3^3=27, 27 + 13=40. a_4=121. 3^4=81, 81 + 40=121. a_5=364. 3^5=243, 243 + 121=364. a_6=1093. 3^6=729, 729 + 364=1093. a_7=3280. 3^7=2187, 2187 + 1093=3280. a_8=9841. 3^8=6561, 6561 + 3280=9841. a_9=29524. 3^9=19683, 19683 + 9841=29524. So, it seems that a_n = 3^n + a_{n-1}, but wait, that's not quite right because a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is different from 3^n + a_{n-1}. Wait, let me think again. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a_1. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Hmm, but let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each layer step by step seems manageable. Alternatively, if I consider that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its closed-form can be found. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, using this formula, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading up to the 9th layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer wraps around that with 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Let's see, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, then each layer outwards is one more. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1). So, in total, there are 9 layers, each adding a 1+3(...). Therefore, my earlier computation is correct with 9 layers, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me check the computations again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1 =4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is similar to a geometric series but with an added constant. But since I already derived the closed-form formula and confirmed it with the step-by-step computation, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). So that's 88752. But when I broke it down, I got 88572. Wait, that suggests that either my digit-by-digit is wrong or my component addition is wrong. Let me add the components again: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. So, adding 60000 + 27000: 60000 + 20000=80000; 80000 +7000=87000. 87000 +1500=88500. 88500 +60=88560. 88560 +12=88572. So that's 88572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit must have an error. Let me check each step: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88752. But that's not matching. Wait, 29524 *3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 *3: Let's compute 29524 *3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 +524*3. 29000*3=87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 1500 +72=1572. Then, 87000 +1572=88572. So, that confirms it's 88572. So, my digit-by-digit method must have had a mistake. Perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me try again, writing it out:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    -----------\n      8 8 7 5 2\n\nWait, but that would be 88752, which contradicts the correct sum. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units. So, when multiplying by 3, starting from the units:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88752. But when adding up the parts, it's 88572. So, there's a conflict here. Let me check with another method. Let me compute 29524 *3 using another approach. 29524 *3: Let's break it into (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 88572 is correct. Therefore, my earlier digit-by-digit multiplication must have been incorrect. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out step by step:\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. But that would be 88752, which is not correct. But when adding the parts, it's 88572. So, where is the mistake? Wait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n        2 9 5 2 4\n      x       3\n      -----------\n        8 8 7 5 2\n\nWait, that's 88752, but when I add the parts, it's 88572. There's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result should be 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88752.\n\nBut according to the component method, it's 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3 using a calculator to verify.\n\n29524 *3: 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's compute:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524\n\n+29524\n\n+29524\n\n= ?\n\nLet me add them:\n\n29524\n\n+29524\n\n=59048\n\n59048 +29524:\n\n59048 +20000=79048\n\n79048 +9000=88048\n\n88048 +500=88548\n\n88548 +24=88572\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. I must have miscounted the carries or misaligned the digits. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, so going back, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, I should get 88572, not 88752. So, my earlier step where I thought Layer 9 was 29524 is correct, but then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*Layer8, which I had computed as 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. That seems correct.\n\nSo, then, the final step is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing each layer, I had Layer9 as 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I thought it was 88752, but that was a mistake. The correct multiplication gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computation of each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, Layer9=29524\n\nThen, 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had a different result, I was confused, but now I see that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I just need to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in each step, which I double-checked. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " So putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually seems manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = (b)/(1 - a) + C*a^{n}. Let me check that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p. So, L_p = 1 + 3*L_p, which gives L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, is there a formula for such a nested expression? It seems like each layer is a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps I can find a recursive formula here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's check: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Simplify: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Let's see, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without calculating each layer. That's much faster, especially if there are many layers. But since I had only nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. By solving the recurrence, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, which in this case would be a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that 88,572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's similar to expanding a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, since each term adds 1 before multiplying by 3, it's a bit different. But using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, or by solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but earlier when computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time you go out, you add another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...): The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( is a new layer. Let me count how many times 1+3( appears. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1+3(Layer 2). Layer 4: 1+3(Layer 3). Layer 5: 1+3(Layer 4). Layer 6: 1+3(Layer 5). Layer 7: 1+3(Layer 6). Layer 8: 1+3(Layer 7). Layer 9: 1+3(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed step by step. So, my earlier computation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find that the innermost layer (n=9) equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time in case the number of layers increases. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. It seems like each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(k) where k is the number of layers. Then, f(k) = 1 + 3*f(k-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent f(k) is 1 + 3*f(k-1). So, for example, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Then, the total expression would be 3*f(9). So, if I can find a closed-form formula for f(k), that might be easier than computing each layer manually.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern in the f(k) values:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 13\n\nf(3) = 40\n\nf(4) = 121\n\nf(5) = 364\n\nf(6) = 1093\n\nf(7) = 3280\n\nf(8) = 9841\n\nf(9) = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a pattern or formula for f(k).\n\nThe recurrence relation is: f(k) = 3*f(k-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: f(k) = 3*f(k-1). The solution to this is f(k) = C*3^k, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(k) = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is f(k) = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(k) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values:\n\nFor k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, f(k) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since our expression is 3*f(9), let's compute f(9):\n\nf(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I let x be the innermost expression, then x = 1 + 3*(next innermost expression). But since it's nested nine times, perhaps it's better to stick with the formula I derived.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is adding another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time, you have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression would involve terms like 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, etc., up to 3^9, multiplied by 1s.\n\nWait, let me try expanding it:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds 3 times the previous. So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count how many times 3 is raised to each power.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost 1 + 3 is 1 + 3^1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3^1) = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, when you have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), each time you expand, you get 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... up to some power.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me consider the expression f(k) = 1 + 3*f(k-1), which we already solved as f(k) = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, with k=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression without the outermost 3, it's f(9) = sum_{i=0}^{9} 3^i} ?\n\nWait, no, because each term is 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series but scaled by 3 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{k} 3^i} ?\n\nWait, let's test that: sum_{i=0}^{k} 3^i} = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, which is exactly what we have for f(k). So, yes, f(k) is the sum of a geometric series from i=0 to k of 3^i.\n\nTherefore, f(k) = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial step-by-step computation, let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents directly, since we know f(k) = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by recognizing it as a geometric series, we arrive at the same result. The final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a way to represent this recursively or using a geometric series. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when we set the recurrence to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated.\n\nSo, both methods, computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation, lead to the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got it now. The final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire result. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840 +0=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, for each n, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0)*r^n, but wait, actually, when r \u2260 1, the solution is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, maybe I should derive it properly. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. First, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By recognizing the pattern and deriving a closed-form formula for the sequence, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation which can be solved to find the value at each step. After computing each layer iteratively and verifying with the closed-form formula, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value at the nth layer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Find the Closed-form Formula**: Solving the recurrence relation, we get a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me cross-verify my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.

But let me check the computations again because sometimes it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me compute 3 * 9841 first to get Layer 9:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2. So 9841 *3 = 29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 29524 *3:\n\nAs before, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1 as 1+3=4, Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, Layer 3 as 1+3*13=40, and so on up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer, and there are nine such layers before the outermost 3(...). So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed as above. So, my earlier computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to model this.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient because it uses the formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to error, especially with more layers. But since the problem only has nine layers, both methods work, but the formula is more scalable.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n- Identified that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n- Solved the recurrence relation to find a general formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n- Applied this formula for n=9 to get a_9 = 29524.\n- Multiplied by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. The formula method seems solid, and the step-by-step computation confirmed each layer's value. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

That seems right. Alternatively, I could notice a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, to find a general formula for L_n, since it's a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:  \n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the outermost layer to be 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire computation using the formula, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but for more layers, the formula would be much more efficient. Anyway, I think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Hmm, that seems quite large, but given the number of layers, it might be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, it would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct. So, that's another way to think about it. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which can be expressed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.

So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, no mistake there. Then, 3*29524: As we did before, that's 88,572.

Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this, so 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => Subtract a_p from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => 2*a_p = -1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the closed-form formula also gives us the same result. Therefore, I'm absolutely sure that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Let's denote the innermost term as a base case. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series could have saved time, but since I'm just starting out, computing each layer step by step was a good way to ensure I didn't make a mistake. It's always reassuring to cross-verify using a different method. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So yes, the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could be generalized, but since the expression is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually seems manageable. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, which is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a formula for it. Let's see, the recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 =4. So, 3A =4 +1/2= 9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59049. Therefore, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so it's a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way. The innermost term is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3 + 3*3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3*3) =1 +3 +3*3 +3*3*3, and so on. So, each layer adds another term of 3^k, where k increases by 1 each time. So, after n layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 1 +3^1. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3^1)=1 +3 +3^2. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3 +3^2)=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3, and so on. So, after 9 layers, the expression inside would be 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^9). The sum inside is a geometric series. The sum S =1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^9. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} -1)/(r -1), where r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms minus 1. Here, r=3, and the number of terms is 10 (from 3^0 to 3^9). So, S=(3^{10} -1)/(3 -1)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series\u2014the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work multiple times, so I don't see any mistakes here. It's a bit of a lengthy computation, but breaking it down layer by layer makes it manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series or solving the recurrence relation provides a more elegant and quicker solution, but both approaches lead to the same result.

    "text": " So putting it all together: 88,572? Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the carry-over.

So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then, 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would work. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, etc., up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\n3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula for L_9: (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88,572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and check each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps it can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. Yep, that seems solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The solution involves recognizing the pattern, solving the recurrence, and then computing the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Continue this process up to Layer 9.\n\n3. **Use Recurrence Relation**: Recognize that each layer \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).

    "text": " So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me cross-verify my steps because when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer up to Layer 9. Let's go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, my initial computation seems correct. But just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that might simplify the computation. Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to ensure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write down 7, carry over 0. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something where each term is built upon the previous one. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, but actually, the first layer is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nBut actually, in our case, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to Layer 9. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be seen as a sum of terms where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is a sum of 1's multiplied by 3^k for k from 0 to 8, plus the outermost 3*1. Wait, perhaps that's a different way to model it.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as T_1 =1+3=4.\n\nThen, T_2=1+3*T_1=1+3*4=13.\n\nT_3=1+3*T_2=1+3*13=40.\n\nContinuing up to T_9=1+3*T_8=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*T_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of each layer as adding another term, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire expression as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power. Let's see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time we open a new parenthesis, we add a 1 and multiply by 3. So, the total number of 1's would be 9, each multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to their depth.\n\nWait, perhaps the total expression can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nSo, if we have 9 layers, each contributing a 1, and each multiplied by 3^(number of layers - position). Let me try to express this.\n\nLet me think of the expression as follows:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1's. Each layer adds a 1, so with 9 layers, there are 9 ones. Each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to how many layers are above it.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it), the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, E = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k) + 3*3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not exactly. Wait, let me think again.\n\nEach 1 in the layers is at a different level. The innermost 1 is at level 9, and it's multiplied by 3^8, because there are 8 layers above it. The next 1 is at level 8, multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is at level 1, multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(sum of these terms). Let me write it out:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nSo, each 1 is at a different depth. The innermost 1 is at depth 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8, the next 1 is at depth 8, multiplied by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1 at depth 1, multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, but each term is 1, so it's sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2=9841.\n\nWait, but that's the sum inside, and then we have 3*(sum) + 3*1? Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, actually, the expression E is 3*(sum of 1's each multiplied by 3^k from k=0 to 8). So, the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2=9841. Then, E=3*9841=29523. But that's not matching our earlier result. Wait, that can't be right because earlier we had E=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me see.\n\nWait, when I expand the expression, each layer adds a 1, but each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it. So, for example:\n\n- The innermost 1 is in Layer 1, so when we compute Layer 9, it's multiplied by 3^8.\n\n- The next 1 in Layer 2 is multiplied by 3^7.\n\n- And so on, up to the 1 in Layer 9, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the sum inside Layer 9 is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841.\n\nThen, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8}3^k) =1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, using the geometric series formula, we can compute the inner sum as (3^9 -1)/2=9841, then Layer 9=1 +3*9841=29524, and finally E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)))) with 9 layers.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 +3=4, then each layer wraps around that, multiplying by 3 and adding 1, up to 9 layers, then multiplying the result by 3.\n\nSo, the step-by-step computation is correct, and using the geometric series approach also leads us to the same result.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). We compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572  \n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my computations because that seems like a lot of steps, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to make it faster instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The recursive formula is Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. Starting from Layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but actually, if I consider the layers starting from n=1 to n=9, with Layer 1 being 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in terms of the recurrence, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Alternatively, if I index it starting from n=0, where a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, the general formula would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1), which simplifies to a_n = 3^n * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n, where n is the number of layers, is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses starting from the innermost. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 inside each other: The innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1), up to layer 9: 1+3*(layer8). So, the outermost is layer9, which is then multiplied by 3. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(layer9). So, using the formula, layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if there were more layers. So, in general, for an expression with k layers, the innermost being 1+3, the outermost would be (3^{k+1} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3. So, in this case, k=9, so it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = 3*(29524) = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) step by step: 3^10 = 59049. 59049 - 1 = 59048. 59048 / 2 = 29524. 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can use the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation to find the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4.\n\n2. **Use the recurrence relation formula**: The general term for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n3. **Determine the number of layers**: There are 9 layers in the expression.\n\n4. **Compute the 9th layer**: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's see, if I have Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, for example, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, which is 1 + 3*4. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each time, it's tripling the previous layer and adding 1. So, if I think about it, each layer is following the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, yes, 88752. Therefore, the final result is 88,752. Let me double-check each step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88752. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88752. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I also get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,752. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So yes, 29524*3=88572. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 in units, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, carry over 1, 9+9+1=19, carry over 1, 2+2+1=5. So, 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, 4 + 2 = 6, 0 + 5 = 5, 9 + 9 = 18, carry over 1, 5 + 2 +1=8. So, 88572. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again: 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Wait, that would be 88,872. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my addition again. Maybe I made a mistake in adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524: Let's compute this step by step.\n\n29524\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write 9, carry 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add the third 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 88,872. But addition shows it's 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n     29524\n   x     3\n   ---------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 2 (from 4*3). So, that's 88,572. So, I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, so that means when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I might have misaligned the digits. Let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n- Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15.

So, my initial confusion was because I miscounted the digits when writing down the result. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(Layer 9) where Layer 9 was 29524. So, 3*29524.\n\nAnother way to compute 3*29524 is to break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches the addition result.

Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, all layers are correct, and the final multiplication is correct.\n\nI think I've got this right.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of layers. Each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3... parts. Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did earlier. So, my computation should be correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my multiplication just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. So starting from the innermost Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recompute the layers step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, where n starts at 1, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another set. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...), so up to Layer 9. So, a_9 would be the value of the innermost expression before the outermost 3 is multiplied. So, a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to recognize this as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand this, each term can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let's see: Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nContinuing this pattern, each a_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, that's a geometric series where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to n. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for a_9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, using the geometric series approach, I also get 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the key steps again. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this multiplication again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula: 3^{11} is 177147. 177147 - 3 = 177144. 177144 / 2 = 88572. Correct. So, all methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've double-checked all the steps, so I'm pretty sure the answer is right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me verify the multiplication once more to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit: 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing from the last digit: 8 (ten thousands place), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, no, that's not correct because when we write the result, it's the other way around. Let me correct that. Actually, when performing multiplication, we write the digits from right to left, so the first digit we compute is the units place, then tens, hundreds, etc. So, 4*3=12, units place is 2, carry 1. Next, 2*3=6 +1=7, tens place is 7, carry 0. Next, 5*3=15, hundreds place is 5, carry 1. Next, 9*3=27 +1=28, thousands place is 8, carry 2. Next, 2*3=6 +2=8, ten thousands place is 8. So, the result is 88572. That's correct. So, I think I did each step correctly. Each layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and then the final step was multiplying the outermost layer by 3. So, the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9+9=18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2+2=4 +1=5. So that's 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 8+4=12, write 2, carry 1. 4+2=6 +1=7. 0+5=5. 9+9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. So that's 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I feel like the numbers might be getting too large too quickly, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm wondering if there's a pattern here that I could have recognized earlier, maybe a geometric series or something, which could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, if I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x. But since it's nested multiple times, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence. Let's compute a few terms: a1 = 1 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 39 = 40 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 120 = 121 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 363 = 364 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a10 = 1 + 3*a9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, but in our original problem, we only have 9 layers, right? Because the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a9), where a9 is 29524. So, 3*a9 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 1: 1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 1 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 => A = (3/2)/3 = 1/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (1/2)*3^n - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a1 = (1/2)*3 - 1/2 = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (1/2)*9 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (1/2)*27 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (1/2)*3^9 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^9 is 19683. So, a9 = (19683)/2 - 1/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier I computed a9 as 29524. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in the original problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a2. Then each layer adds another a_n, so in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a9), where a9 is 9841. Wait, but earlier, when I computed the layers step by step, I got a9 as 29524, which seems inconsistent with the formula. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the layer numbering. Let me clarify. In the original problem, the innermost parentheses is 1 + 3, which is a1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 40, and so on, up to a9 = 1 + 3*a8. So, in the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer, starting from a1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier general formula, I set a1 = 1, which might have been the initial condition. So perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me redefine the sequence with a1 being the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so a1 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 40, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Then, the general solution would be different. Let me find the general solution for this case. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, with a1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is the same: a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this with n=1: a1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Ah, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation where a9 was 29524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got before. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's another way to get there. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.
