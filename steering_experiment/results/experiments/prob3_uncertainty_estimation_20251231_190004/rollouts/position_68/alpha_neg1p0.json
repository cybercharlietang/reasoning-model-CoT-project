    "text": " So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then + 9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then + 524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, for each layer n, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_1 = 4. So, for n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, for n=2: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have the system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substitute A into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula gives me the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty cool! It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allows for a more efficient solution. I think I might have taken a while computing each layer manually, but it's good to see that both methods lead to the same answer.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Plug n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4/2) - 1/2 = (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2 = (59049/2) - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 1 + 3*something. If I expand it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding it step by step, although it might get messy. Let's denote the innermost part as S: S = 1 + 3. Then moving out: Next layer: 1 + 3*S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, this is similar to what I did earlier. So, it's the same as computing each layer step by step. So, perhaps the easiest way is to compute each layer as I did before, and then multiply the final layer by 3. Since I've already done that and cross-verified using the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another method, like binary expansion or something, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, let's see. Each term in the layers can be thought of as adding 3^n, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here. Let me think. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*something. If I expand it all the way, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding it step by step, although it's going to be tedious. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4. 3. Use each computed layer to find the next one, up to Layer 9. 4. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer. 5. Cross-verify using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, which confirmed the result. 6. Consider alternative methods like expanding the entire expression or using geometric series, but realized that step-by-step computation was sufficient and accurate. Therefore, I conclude that the computed value is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, then subtract 476 * 3. Wait, because 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572. I think this confirms that the answer is correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors when multiplying 29524 by 3. Let me compute it again: 29524 * 3. Break it down digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572, right? Wait, let me write it out properly: The number is 29524.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but I need to check what L_0 would be. Wait, in this case, L_1 is the first term, so maybe L_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from L_1. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern: L_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. L_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. L_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. L_4 = 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121. Oh, I see! Each L_n is equal to the sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=n. Because 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify this. For L_1: n=1, sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches L_1. For L_2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which matches L_2. Similarly, L_3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is correct. So, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, since we have 9 layers, L_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, so it's a geometric series. But since we've already confirmed it using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from some term. Wait, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's more like a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 and adding 1. But since I've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it, I think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct. Hmm, that seems right. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. This recurrence relation can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also consider n=2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): 6A = 9 \u2192 A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plug A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows this pattern and directly applied the formula to find the value without computing each layer individually. That might have saved some time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, it was manageable to compute each one step by step. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original problem was: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) I broke it down into nine layers, computed each from the inside out, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result. Using both the step-by-step method and the formula method, I arrived at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. Just to be absolutely thorough, let me try computing a couple of the layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, Layer 4: According to the formula, L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = 243 - 1 = 242/2 = 121. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, Layer 5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = 729 -1 = 728/2 = 364 \u2192 Correct. So, yes, the formula is reliable. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is built by 1 + 3*(previous term). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, the problem is asking for 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I did everything correctly.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. First, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 87572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, that can't be. Wait, did I make a mistake here? Wait, no, because the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. But 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. 177144 / 2 = 88572. But earlier, I computed 3*29524 = 87572. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, where did I go wrong? Let's check the formula again. Wait, if L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. But according to the formula, it's (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me do this multiplication carefully: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 87572. So, that's correct. But according to the formula, it's 88572. So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. But 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But when I computed 3*29524, I got 87572. So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 3^{10}. Let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=87572. So, that's correct. But according to the formula, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. But 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. But that's different from 87572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the expression is 3*(L_9), but L_9 is already 1 + 3*L_8, and so on. Wait, no, the formula should still hold. Let me check the formula again. The general solution was L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2=88572. But when I compute 3*29524, I get 87572. So, there's a discrepancy. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the manual computation. Let me check 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 29524*3.

Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the formula must be wrong. Wait, but how? Let me check the recurrence relation again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. The general solution was L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test it for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243-1)/2=121. Correct. So, the formula is correct. Therefore, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=87572. But according to the formula, 3*L_9=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572. So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see: 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. But 3^{11}=177147, so (177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572. But when I compute 3*29524, I get 87572. So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-examine the general solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)}=C*3^n. The particular solution is K=-1/2. Therefore, L_n=C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition L_1=4: 4=C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=3/2. Therefore, L_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the formula is correct. Therefore, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572. But when I compute 3*29524, I get 87572. So, there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the manual multiplication. Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but according to the formula, it should be 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is not applicable because the expression is 3*(L_9), whereas the formula was derived for L_n=1+3*L_{n-1}. Wait, no, the formula is for L_n, and the entire expression is 3*L_9, which should be equal to (3^{11}-3)/2=88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the manual multiplication. Let me compute 29524*3 again using a different method.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nAh! There we go. So, 29524*3=88572. Earlier, I must have made a mistake in the manual digit-by-digit multiplication. So, the correct answer is 88572, which matches the formula. Therefore, I must have miscalculated earlier when I thought 3*29524 was 87572. It's actually 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3^{10} -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each time it's inside another set of parentheses. Let's see:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times, so there are 9 layers, meaning a_9 is the outermost. So, yes, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until it becomes a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so maybe a_0 would be 1? Let me check. If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. But a_1 is 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 =1. So, the general formula would be a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}*a_0. But since a_0=1, it's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which works. So, with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence relation gives a closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the given problem, there are 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is 1 + 3 times the next term, forming a nested structure with 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but with a different structure because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, that can be written as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So yes, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct. Hmm, so it seems like each step is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, let me consider a general case. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + r*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1. Then, each a_n = 1 + r*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + r*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*r^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + r*A \u2192 A - r*A = 1 \u2192 A*(1 - r) = 1 \u2192 A = 1/(1 - r), provided that r \u2260 1. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*r^n + 1/(1 - r). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 1: 1 = C*r^1 + 1/(1 - r) \u2192 1 = C*r + 1/(1 - r). Solving for C: C*r = 1 - 1/(1 - r) = ( (1 - r) - 1 ) / (1 - r ) = (-r)/(1 - r). Therefore, C = (-r)/(1 - r) / r = (-1)/(1 - r) = 1/(r - 1). So, the general solution is a_n = (1/(r - 1)) * r^n + 1/(1 - r). Simplifying, since 1/(1 - r) = -1/(r - 1), we can write: a_n = (r^n)/(r - 1) - 1/(r - 1) = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, for our case, r = 3, and n = 9, because we have nine layers. Wait, let me confirm: The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which would be a_1 = 4, but according to the formula, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my indexing is off. Let me check again. If a_1 = 1, then a_2 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches Layer 1 in our problem. So, in the problem, Layer 1 corresponds to a_2 in the formula. Therefore, if we have nine layers, the outermost layer would correspond to a_9 in the formula, which would be (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1). Let me compute that: 3^9 is 19683. So, (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, that's exactly what we got for Layer 8 in our manual calculation earlier. Because in our problem, the innermost Layer 1 was 4, which is a_2 = 4, then Layer 2 is a_3 = 13, and so on, up to Layer 9 being a_10. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me try to align this properly. If in the formula, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 4, a_3 = 13, a_4 = 40, and so on, then each a_n corresponds to the nth layer starting from the innermost. So, in our problem, we have nine layers, which would correspond to a_9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but in our manual calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, so maybe the formula gives us a_9 = 9841, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses before multiplying by 3. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that's different from our manual calculation where Layer 9 was 29524. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2.     1 + 3(\n3.         1 + 3(\n4.             1 + 3(\n5.                 1 + 3(\n6.                     1 + 3(\n7.                         1 + 3(\n8.                             1 + 3(\n9.                                 1 + 3(\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each nested within the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer: 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, according to the formula, a_n = (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1). So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. But in our manual calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, if we consider that the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result after nine layers, then 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts our manual calculation. So, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me clarify. The formula gives a_n as the value after n layers, starting from a_1 = 1. So, each a_n is the value inside the nth layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*(a_9) = 3*(9841) = 29523. But in our manual calculation, we found Layer 9 to be 29524, which is a_10. So, perhaps the formula gives a_n for n layers, starting from a_1 = 1. Therefore, if we have nine layers, a_9 = 9841, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 29523. But in our manual calculation, we went up to Layer 9 as 29524, which suggests that maybe we have ten layers? Let me recount the layers in the original problem. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, so there are nine \"1 + 3(\" instances, each nested within the previous. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Therefore, the total number of layers is nine, each corresponding to a_n from n=1 to n=9. So, according to the formula, a_9 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523. But wait, in our manual calculation, we ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which would mean that 3*29524 = 88572. So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I went wrong. In the formula, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. For n=9, that's (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. So, a_9 = 9841, which is the value inside the ninth layer. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523. But in our manual calculation, we computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. So, that suggests that our manual calculation considered Layer 9 as a_10, not a_9. Therefore, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers in the original problem. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write this out with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Therefore, the total number of layers inside the 3*(...) is nine, but the outermost 3 is separate. So, in the formula, a_n represents the value inside the nth layer, so a_9 would be Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(9841) = 29523. But in our manual calculation, we computed Layer 9 as 29524, which suggests that perhaps we considered the outermost 3 as part of the layers. Let me check that. In our manual calculation, we started with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, we multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. So, according to this, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, giving 88572. But according to the formula, a_9 = 9841, and 3*a_9 = 29523. So, which one is correct? Let me see. If I compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, it's equivalent to 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Therefore, 3*9841 = 29523. But in our manual calculation, we ended up with 88572, which is 3*29524. So, where is the confusion? Let me try to align the layers correctly. The formula gives a_n as the value after n layers, starting from a_1 = 1. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Therefore, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 4, a_3 = 13, ..., a_9 = 9841. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523. However, in our manual calculation, we computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is a_10 in the formula. So, perhaps the original problem has ten layers? Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's nine \"1 + 3(\" instances, each nested within the previous. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Therefore, the total number of layers is nine, each corresponding to a_n from n=1 to n=9. So, a_9 = 9841, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 29523. But in our manual calculation, we went up to Layer 9 as 29524, which would be a_10. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the manual calculation by considering one extra layer. Let me recount the layers step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so according to this, Layer 9 is 29524, which is a_10 in the formula because the formula starts at a_1 = 1. So, in the formula, a_10 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Therefore, a_10 = 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_10 = 3*29524 = 88572. But in the original problem, we have nine layers of \"1 + 3(\", so that would correspond to a_9 in the formula, which is 9841, and the outermost expression would be 3*9841 = 29523. Therefore, I think the confusion arises from whether we count the initial 1 as Layer 1 or not. If we consider the innermost \"1 + 3\" as Layer 1, then the original problem has nine layers, leading to a_9 = 9841, and the final result is 3*9841 = 29523. However, in our manual calculation, we considered the innermost \"1 + 3\" as Layer 1 and computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, which would be a_10, implying ten layers. But the original problem only has nine layers of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3. Let me make sure by writing out the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, according to this, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 in the formula, which is 9841, leading to the final result of 3*9841 = 29523. However, in our manual calculation, we computed Layer 9 as 29524, which would be a_10. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount the layers in the original problem. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each \"(\" after a \"1 + 3\" starts a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2.     1 + 3(\n3.         1 + 3(\n4.             1 + 3(\n5.                 1 + 3(\n6.                     1 + 3(\n7.                         1 + 3(\n8.                             1 + 3(\n9.                                 1 + 3(\n\nSo, there are nine \"1 + 3(\" instances, each starting a new layer. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 9: 1 + 3, and each preceding layer wraps around that. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is a_9 = 9841. Therefore, the final result is 3*9841 = 29523. But in our manual calculation, we computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, which would be a_10. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers in the manual calculation. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, in our manual calculation, we started with Layer 1 as the innermost 1 + 3, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9 as 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to a_9 in the formula, which is 9841. But in our manual calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. So, that suggests that Layer 9 in the formula is a_9 = 9841, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 29523. However, in our manual calculation, we computed Layer 9 as 29524, which would mean that we considered the outermost 3 as part of the layers, making it ten layers. Therefore, I think the confusion is that the formula counts the initial 1 as a_1, whereas in our manual calculation, we started counting from the innermost \"1 + 3\" as Layer 1. Therefore, to align the two, we need to adjust the indices. If we consider the innermost \"1 + 3\" as Layer 1, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 corresponds to a_10 in the formula. Therefore, a_10 = 29524, and the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, if we consider the initial 1 as a_1, then the innermost \"1 + 3\" is a_2 = 4, and the outermost expression is 3*a_10 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 88572, as per our manual calculation, because we correctly followed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. The formula approach might have been misapplied because of index misalignment. Therefore, I conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers because if I made a mistake in one of the layers, the entire result would be off. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2705\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2705\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2705\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2705\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2705\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2705\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2705\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2705\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2705\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2705\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just think again about the structure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I computed Layer 1 as 1 + 3, that's the innermost, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is straightforward. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The closed-form solution for such a linear recurrence can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1, a_1=4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, which is not 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a_n = 2*3^{n} -1. Let's test that. For n=1: 2*3^1 -1=6-1=5, which is not 4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's try that. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Yes, that seems to work. So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the result we got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can confirm that the result is correct without computing each layer step by step, which is useful. But since I already computed each layer and got the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each time, the expression is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then multiplied by 3. So, as a formula, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula we found earlier. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I again arrive at the same result. This gives me even more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series in another way. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. If I denote the innermost expression as x, then each layer adds a 1 + 3*x structure. But since there are nine layers, it's a bit more involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as expanding the expression step by step, but since I've already computed each layer, that's probably redundant. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's not a straightforward geometric series. However, using the recurrence relation approach seems more appropriate here. In any case, having computed each layer step by step and verified using the recurrence relation and its closed-form solution, I can confidently say that the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming, especially if there are more layers. Let me think if there's a geometric series or something similar involved here. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's a bit more involved because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me try to model this. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) But wait, that's not exactly correct because the innermost term is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Alternatively, maybe I can model each layer as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence relation: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...).

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4= (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did before, which also leads to the same result. Either way, I arrive at 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer computation to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That confirms the result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives us \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3, we get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the final step is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the answer should be 88572. Let me just confirm once again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to make a mistake when dealing with multiple layers of multiplication and addition, especially with larger numbers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. This resembles a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach also gives me the same result, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer adds a power of 3 multiplied by some coefficient. Let me try to expand the expression step by step:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572\n\nYes, same result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the nth term can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, since we have nine layers, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that formula again. The general term a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if that approach works. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation here. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine terms, computing each step is manageable, as I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Let me think about whether this nested expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer, which is 88572.

Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can model this recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate the coefficients on both sides: For 3^{n}: A = A. For constants: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the closed-form formula, which is much faster, especially for larger n. But since n=9 isn't too large, both methods work. I think I've verified it sufficiently. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me verify my calculations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting over, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this, so 3*29524. As before, 29524 * 3: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, with these nested expressions, you can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if that's possible here. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9 as before. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general form for such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = (L(0) - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). Wait, but let me recall the exact formula. For a linear recurrence relation like L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution is L(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, actually, it's L(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But in our case, L(1) = 4, which is L(1) = 1 + 3*1 = 4. So, L(1) = 4. So, perhaps I can model it starting from n=1. Let me see: The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*a^n, where a=3. The particular solution is a constant, since b is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution L_p = K. Then, substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct, L3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern right away, computing each layer step by step also led me to the same conclusion. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, the answer is consistent. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*previous term. This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is a function of the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, n=3: a3=40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. Since there are nine layers, I need to compute up to a9. Alternatively, since this is a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. a1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so perhaps the total sum can be expressed as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I need to think carefully. Wait, when I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, it's adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I expand it all the way, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me try to expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Then, the next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(previous)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Next: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Then: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363. Next: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092. Then: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279. Next: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840. Then: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit different from before, but actually, it's the same process. Each time, I'm computing the next layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 3. Hmm, maybe I can think of this as a sum where each term is 3^k. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand it completely, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me try to write it out fully: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I keep expanding, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count how many 3s there are. Each layer adds another 3, so starting from the innermost, there are nine 3s. So, when expanded, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step, but it's going to be tedious. Alternatively, since we've already determined that a9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a9=88572, I can be confident that this is the correct answer. To double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have only two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Compute this: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, using the formula: a2=(3^{3}-1)/2=26/2=13. Then, total expression is 3*a2=39. Correct. If I compute it manually: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13)=39. So, the formula works for n=2. Similarly, for n=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))=3*(1 + 3*13)=3*40=120. Using the formula: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*a3=120. Correct. So, the formula holds for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sum where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we derive a formula for the nth term, which confirms the result. The final computation is 3 multiplied by the 9th term, yielding the answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Each time, it's 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each prior adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) adds a new layer. So, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, that would mean that the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3).\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, that would give 88572. But let me confirm each layer step by step because maybe I made a mistake in the earlier layers.\n\nLet me list each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer's computation seems correct. Let me check a couple more layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As we computed earlier, that's 88572. So, that seems to check out.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches our earlier computation. Good.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms our result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By computing each subsequent layer up to the ninth, we find the value at each step. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding 29524 + 29524. Let me do that again:\n\n29524  \n+29524  \n------------  \nStarting from the units place:  \n4 + 4 = 8  \n2 + 2 = 4  \n5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1  \n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 (carry) = 19, write 9, carry 1  \n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 (carry) = 5  \nSo that's 59048.

Therefore, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572, not 88752. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me redo that correctly.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3:  \nStarting from the right:  \n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.  \n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.  \n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.  \nSo the result is 88572. Okay, that matches the addition method. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly.

That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication also checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked everything, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the result is 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again just to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, maybe. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without calculating each layer. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me write it out properly:\n\n      29524\n    x    3\n    --------\n      88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also consider n=0, but wait, maybe it's better to see if there's a pattern. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, this is a geometric series in disguise. Let me see: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nI can express a_n as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since I only had 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad. Either way, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the ninth layer to be 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers: Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(\" before the innermost. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, the first \"1+3\" is Layer 1, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside the first 3(...), there's 1+3(...), which is Layer 2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), which is Layer 3, and so on until Layer 9. Wait, so actually, the innermost is Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again. When I start computing from the innermost, I have Layer 1 as the innermost, then Layer 2 is the next one out, etc., up to Layer 9 as the outermost. But in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.
