    "text": " Let's plug into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1 using the formula: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have noticed that each layer is just multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression but not exactly because each term is built from the previous one. But in this case, computing each layer step by step worked well, especially since there are only nine layers. So, to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and after computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous term})\\).

Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so this might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.

Maybe this approach is complicating things, or perhaps I need to adjust the particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is correct, but the particular solution needs to account for the constant term. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.

Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our initial terms are integers. Maybe the homogeneous solution plus particular solution would work better. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for a_n. Since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence, we can solve it as follows. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, computing each layer step by step is straightforward and ensures accuracy, especially since the number of layers isn't too large. It's a good practice to compute a few layers manually to verify that the pattern holds, which it does in this case.

Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.

Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4.

Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe I need to adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try again. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Hmm, but in our case, the initial term a_1 = 4, which is an integer, so maybe the closed-form expression is slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n + D. Let me try solving the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

By computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation, I found that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524, and multiplying by the outermost 3 gives 88572. Yes, that seems right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.
