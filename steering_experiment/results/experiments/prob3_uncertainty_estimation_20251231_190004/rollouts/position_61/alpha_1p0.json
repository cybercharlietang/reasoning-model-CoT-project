    "text": " Wait, 2 is the tens place. So, 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so expanding the entire expression might lead to a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as x = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*x, where x is the previous layer. But since I've already found a formula for a_n, maybe it's not necessary, but just to explore, let's see. Alternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this out step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me define each step:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without expanding each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to see how many terms there are when expanded. Each time, you have a 1 plus 3 times another term, so when expanded, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... up to 3^9*1, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so the entire expression might be a sum of 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but multiplied by 3 at the end. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me try to expand it step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Wait, 1 + 3 is 4, 4 +9 is 13, 13 +27 is 40. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, each E_n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, in general, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k\n\nBut wait, in our case, E1 corresponds to sum up to 3^1, E2 up to 3^2, etc.\n\nSo, for E_n, where n is the number of layers, the sum would be up to 3^{n}.\n\nBut in our case, we have nine layers, so E9 would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed E9, I got 29524, and sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is exactly what I found earlier. So, yes, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches my previous result.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it: the entire expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered both the step-by-step expansion and the formula approach, verifying each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It seems consistent, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down into layers, where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Let's compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Therefore, we need to multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, multiplying each digit by 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Then 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Then 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Then 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Then 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 88,572? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nCompute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems right. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3. Break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when I'm dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. For example, let's take a simpler version with fewer layers and see if the approach gives the correct result.\n\nLet's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) with three layers inside. Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute the expression step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I just thought. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the smaller example.\n\nWait, let's compute it properly.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, the outermost 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it step by step without layers:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, with three layers inside, the result is 120. If I compute it using my layer method, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, then 3*40 = 120. That works.\n\nWait, but in my initial problem, I have nine layers, so I need to make sure that each step is correct. Let me check a couple more layers to be thorough.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to approach this problem might be to recognize a pattern or a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric sequence.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). But since a=3, which is greater than 1, the formula would be L_n = (L_0 - (b)/(1 - a)) * a^n + (b)/(1 - a).\n\nWait, but in our case, L_1 = 4. So, perhaps L_0 is undefined here because the innermost layer is L_1. Alternatively, maybe we can model it differently.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution approach. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and solving it generally, which confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute each layer without using the formula, I could proceed as I did initially, computing each step one by one, but using the formula is more efficient and reduces the chance of error, especially with nine layers.\n\nWait, let me just confirm that the formula gives the correct result for n=9: 3^{10} is 59049. 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer approach and the general formula approach\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which leads to exponential growth, as each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer grows rapidly, which is why the numbers get large quickly.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3 * 29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from left to right, we have 88572. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\).\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carryover 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute 3*(Layer 9), I'm getting 88572, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is the next one out, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, each layer is computed correctly, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as Layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find L_2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the original expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait a moment. Let me check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step to verify each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Hmm, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check the initial problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses: Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.

Hmm, but wait, 3*29524: Let me compute it differently to verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I should check this another way, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = k*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, a_1 = 4. Let me check: For n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let's denote the innermost as S: S = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) up to nine layers. Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to nine layers. Let me try to write it out in expanded form. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Now, if I expand E, it's 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) where the inner part is similar to E but one layer less. Wait, that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where there are nine layers. Wait, but in my earlier approach, I saw that each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and E = 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me check: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, E = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I feel like that might not be the right answer. Let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's consider that each layer is defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's similar to a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is: a_n = (a_1 - c/(k-1)) * k^{n} + c/(k-1), where c is the constant term and k is the coefficient. Let me see: Here, c = 1, k = 3. So, the steady-state solution is c/(k - 1) = 1/2. Then, the homogeneous solution is (a_1 - 1/2)*3^{n}. So, a_n = (4 - 1/2)*3^{n} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3^{n} + 1/2. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the solution can be written as a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is the particular solution. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify: A*3^{n} + B = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Therefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the particular solution is B = -1/2. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, we have 9 layers, each being a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Therefore, n = 9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that the formula applies here correctly. The formula I derived was for a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers. Since we have 9 layers, n=9, so 3^{10} -1 over 2, which is correct. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I think I've computed it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of the innermost expression and build up step by step. Using the formula for such a linear recurrence, we determine that the value of the outermost expression before the final multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me check my computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation earlier. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula checks out.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression from the inside out, step by step, using another method or perhaps looking for a pattern or formula that could simplify this process. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is Layer 3. So, this seems to fit. Now, in general, for such a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, which would correspond to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9, which we computed earlier. So, that checks out. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think this is correct. To ensure there are no calculation errors, let me verify each step once again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct. So, I'm confident that this is the right answer. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to expanding a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's nested nine times, it's a finite geometric series. The formula for a finite geometric series is S_n = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In our case, each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so maybe we can model it that way. But since each term is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation approach, we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which aligns with the geometric series formula if we adjust the terms appropriately. So, I think using the recurrence relation was the correct approach here. Another way to think about it is that each time we're adding 1 and then scaling by 3, which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Regardless, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. So let me go back and check each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just compute 29524 * 3 again to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. So each layer is computed correctly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. However, for more layers, a formula might be more efficient. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nWait, this seems like each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, in general, each Layer n is 3*(Layer n-1) + 1.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, we can set a_n = B, so B = 3*B + 1 \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nThen, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to avoid any miscalculations.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nThus, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I went through each layer step by step, then also found a formula to confirm the result, which matched. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093.

Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1, etc., up to L9. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches L3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, matches L4=121. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, matches L5=364. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, matches L6=1093. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, matches L7=3280. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, matches L8=9841. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, matches L9=29524. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have n=9 layers, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire original expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*(L9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\).

So, the result is 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524; 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which in this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 is 4, so maybe L_0 would be 1? Let me think. If n=1, L_1 = 4. If n=2, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, perhaps the formula is L_n = 3^{n} + something. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found as a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have made a mistake in the arithmetic when computing each layer. For instance, when computing Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me double-check that: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Then, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all the layers check out. Then, 3 * 29524: as before, 29524 * 3: 29524*3: 29524*3. Let me compute this another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then 2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7. Then 5 (hundreds)*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Then 9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Then 2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572?

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and going up to Layer 9, which is the one inside the first set of parentheses before the outermost 3. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's see: Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, in general, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2*A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer starting from the innermost, I found that each layer follows a geometric progression, and the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer, and I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and use it to compute the subsequent layers until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next nested term})\\).

So, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me just go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each step adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each nested inside the previous one.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each time another 1+3(...) wraps around it. Let me count the number of 1+3 sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is used:\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), so let's see:\n\nThe innermost is Layer 1: 1+3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\nLayer4:1+3(Layer3)\n\nLayer5:1+3(Layer4)\n\nLayer6:1+3(Layer5)\n\nLayer7:1+3(Layer6)\n\nLayer8:1+3(Layer7)\n\nLayer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So that's 9 layers. So, my earlier computation is correct with 9 layers, each being 1+3*(previous layer). So, the final computation is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check if I made any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps using a formula instead of computing each layer. Let me think about it.\n\nThis expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_n is the nth layer.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 is 1+3=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B =1 \u21d2 B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the solution is correct. I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation.

Let me just verify the computations for each layer to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. I think I did this right. So, the final answer should be 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " So, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, then subtract (30000 - 29524) * 3. Wait, 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, I just thought of something. Each time I compute a layer, I'm using the previous layer's result. So, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check again because sometimes when we have nested expressions, especially with a lot of layers, it's easy to miscount or make an arithmetic error. Let me try an alternative approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Using a recurrence relation approach, we find the general solution and compute the result for the ninth layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined by \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the Recurrence Relation**:\n   - The solution is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the Ninth Layer**:\n   - \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - Final result: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nCompute 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier in computing Layer 9.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also compute L_2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nThen, substituting back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2)\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression inside out is each time 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, it's consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but since each term is added inside the next multiplication, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation was a good approach because it allowed me to find a closed-form formula for a_n, which made computing a_9 straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to expand the entire expression step by step without using the recurrence relation. Let me try that as a check:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I use the step-by-step expansion, the recurrence relation, or the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly to ensure no arithmetic errors:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll steps check out. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 is accurate.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and verifying each part helped a lot. I also liked how using the recurrence relation and the closed-form solution confirmed the result, which added another layer of confidence. It's a good reminder that even complex-looking problems can often be broken down into simpler, manageable parts.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, but 29524 is actually 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7.

Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476*3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200+210=1410+18=1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. So, yes, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K =1 +3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4. Calculating each subsequent layer up to n=9, we find the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, 2 is the tens place. So 2*3=6, plus the carryover 1 makes 7. So, 7 in the tens place. Next, 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next, 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next, 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 is 8. So, 8 in the thousands place. So putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster instead of computing each layer. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left-hand side: A*3^n + B. Right-hand side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th layer is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the closed-form formula directly. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. Using the closed-form formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the entire expression by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Compute each layer up to the ninth, resulting in the ninth layer being 29524.\n4.

Let me check: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the key steps were recognizing the pattern, computing each layer step by step, and then verifying using a recurrence relation formula. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but with patience, it works out.

    "text": " Wait, 2 is in the tens place. So 2 * 3 is 6, plus the carried over 1 is 7. So write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. So write down 8. There are no more digits, so the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because sometimes when I do mental math, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 directly:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12 \u2192 2 with carryover 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 \u2192 5 with carryover 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8 with carryover 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when I'm multiplying, I might miscount the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I computed each layer, I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nWait, let me see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also compute a few terms to find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation, we can model this as a geometric series.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2192 which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014direct computation and the closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since it's nested, the formula approach seems more straightforward.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation, let me check a couple of layers again.\n\nLayer 5: a_5 =1 +3*a_4=1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, all layers check out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the direct computation and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that because 30,000 \u00d7 3 is 90,000, so 29,524 \u00d7 3 should be just a bit less than 90,000. 88,572 is indeed less than 90,000, so that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, to check, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 2 = 59048, plus 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations because if one layer is wrong, everything after that will be off.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, just to cross-verify.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition to find A.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nWait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's good to see that both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way outward, eventually multiplying the outermost result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps because it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Each time, the expression is 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\n...\nUp to Layer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So my earlier computation was correct, computing up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nEach layer n is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer follows L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and since we have 9 layers, we can use the formula we derived to compute L_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step is manageable, though it's easy to make arithmetic errors. Using the formula is more efficient and less error-prone, especially for larger n.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression with 9 layers, each defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Using the closed-form solution, we find L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 87572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Hmm, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I multiplied digit by digit, I thought it was 87572, which is different. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again carefully: 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it down: 8 (from 2*3+2) 8 (from 9*3+1) 5 (from 5*3) 7 (from 2*3+1) 2 (from 4*3). So that's 88572. Yes, that matches the addition method. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back and verify each layer computation again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if there's a quicker way to compute it without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, then each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each time, we have 1 + 3*(...). If I expand this, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, and so on. If I consider that there are 9 layers, then the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))), with 9 threes. Expanding this would result in a sum where each term is 3^k, but I need to figure out the exact coefficients. Alternatively, using the formula we found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, as before. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or express it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By solving each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 (but actually, a_1 is given as 4) Wait, maybe I can solve it as a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 =4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, and so on, up to Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.

So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, let me verify my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is Layer1, and each layer wraps around, so the number of layers is 9, right? Because each time it's 1+3(...), and there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, Layer1 is the innermost, Layer9 is the outermost. So, when I computed Layer9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, yes, that should be the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Suppose we have x = 1 + 3x', where x' is the next layer. But in this case, each layer is similar. So, if we have n layers, the value would be something like (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For Layer1: n=1, (3^1 -1)/2= (3-1)/2=1, but Layer1 is 4. Hmm, not matching. Maybe another formula. Alternatively, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recurrence relation: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1=4. Then, solving the recurrence. The recurrence is linear. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B. Plugging in the recurrence: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. Assume L_k = A*3^k + B. Then, L_k = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Equate to L_k: A*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Subtract A*3^k from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k -1/2. Now, apply initial condition. At k=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A=1.5=3/2. Therefore, L_k= (3/2)*3^k -1/2= (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, L_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer9, k=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(29524)=88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and progressively compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost expression.

    "text": " Hmm, that's the tens place. Then, 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Then, 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Then, 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2. Finally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 87572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, so 29524 * 3 is 88572, not 87572. I think I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation earlier. Let me recount that. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the number is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I correctly computed Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but since it's only nine layers, maybe computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to recap, I approached it step by step, computed each layer, verified the result using a general formula for the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...)\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nEach time, it's 3(1+3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count them:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3(...). So when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I had 8 layers, but it seems like it's 9 layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each time wrapping another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is written inside.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, it's (1+3(1+3))\n- Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n- And so on, until the outermost is 3(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, each layer adds another 1+3(...).

So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check how many times 1+3 appears. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms inside:\n\nEach time, you have a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. So, the first is 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc., up to 1+3(1+3(...)) nine times. So, 9 layers in total. So, computing up to Layer 9 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I compute Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 again to make sure.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, a_1 would actually be the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, so this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u21d2 a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u21d2 0 = 1 + 2*a_p \u21d2 a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " So, 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems high. Let me confirm by another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because that seems like a big number. Did I compute each layer correctly? Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a form of a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, saving time. But since I'm just starting out, computing each layer step by step was a good way to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, expanding the entire expression would give a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by 3, which is essentially a geometric series. But I think the step-by-step computation was manageable here since there are only nine layers. To summarize, the approach was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of the results. 3. After reaching the outermost layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Double-check the computations to ensure accuracy. 5. Optionally, explore if a formula exists to compute the nth layer directly, which can be more efficient for larger expressions. In this case, both methods led to the same result, confirming the correctness of the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572? Wait, let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, so that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9 as 29524. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each layer is one more than three times the previous. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), up to layer9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). \n\nAfter computing all nine layers, the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4 * 3 = 12, carry 1, write 2. Next digit: 2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write 7.

So, putting it all together: 8 (from 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 2 (from 4*3). So, 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by computing the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. Wait, but let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. The expression we're computing is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term in this sequence. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n and then compute a_9 directly. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this method also leads to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. That might have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I had only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Anyway, both methods lead me to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I've considered it from multiple angles and verified each step, so I can be pretty sure that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

So, write down 8, carry over 2. Next, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 8, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, no, let's do it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing from right to left, it's 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems too high because 29524 * 3 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can give me a_n directly without computing each layer.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. Each step seems correct, and the alternative method using the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, yielding the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Then 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572? Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm each layer computation because that's a lot of steps. Let me recast each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I could notice a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers from innermost to outermost. So, L1 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. L3 =1 +3*L2=1+39=40. L4=1 +3*L3=1+120=121. Hmm, I notice that each L(n) =1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for L(n). Let me consider the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r=3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1)= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L(n)= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9: L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern of 4,13,40,121,... which is similar to 3^n + something. But since I found the formula using the recurrence relation, that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting with L(1) = 4. Using the recurrence relation and solving the linear equation, we find that each layer L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check this with a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think about solving the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with a_9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this alternative method using recurrence relations gives me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0.\n\nWait, but a_1 is given as 4, which would correspond to n=1. Hmm, maybe it's better to index starting from 0. Alternatively, perhaps the expansion would be a geometric series.\n\nWait, if I expand a_9, it would be:\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_7)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_7\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_6)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_6\n\nContinuing this way, each expansion adds another term and another power of 3, until we reach a_1.\n\nSince a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, we can see that each layer adds a term of 3^{k} where k increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, for a_9, the expansion would be:\n\na_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*a_0\n\nWait, but a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(3^0 + 3^1) = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nWait, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula I derived earlier for a_n. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nSo, this further confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression using substitution, but I think I've already done that step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use another approach just to be absolutely sure. Let's try computing the expression from the inside out, step by step, but using more detailed calculations.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly using multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relations, and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each calculation.\n\n3. Use the recurrence relation approach to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed the step-by-step result.\n\n4. Alternatively, recognize the pattern as a geometric series and use the sum formula to compute the result.\n\nAll these methods led me to the same final answer, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3.

    "text": " Wait, is the next digit 2? Let me confirm: 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units. So, 4 units, then 2 tens, 5 hundreds, 9 thousands, 2 ten thousands. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Then 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Then 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Then 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Then 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should double-check each layer step by step. Let me list them again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can also think of this expression as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, maybe I can express it as a sum of powers of 3. Let's try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost as E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*(E1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result. Alternatively, if I try to represent the entire expression as a sum, let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand each multiplication, each layer adds another power of 3. For example, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Which is 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ...? Wait, let me think differently. Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(previous), so each layer adds a term that is 3^n. Let me see:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*(E1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, each layer E_n = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n. But wait, when n=1, E1=1+3=4, which is 1 + 3^1. When n=2, E2=1+3+9=13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. When n=3, E3=1+3+9+27=40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, indeed, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, when n=1, it's sum up to 3^1, which is 1+3=4. So, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but starting from k=0: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... +3^n. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that's the same formula I derived earlier! So, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, derived a formula for the nth layer, and confirmed that it all adds up correctly. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).
