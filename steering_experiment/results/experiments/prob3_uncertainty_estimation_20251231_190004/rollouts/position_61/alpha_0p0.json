Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when I compute each layer, I might have made a mistake.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think my calculations are correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. But just to explore, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing both sides, we have B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the problem has nine layers, n=9, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is defined as $L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}$, starting from the innermost layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n follows a geometric progression, and thus the expression can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. But since I already have the closed-form expression, that's probably the most efficient way. So, to recap, by recognizing the pattern and finding the closed-form solution, I can compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. Either approach leads me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form solution. The innermost layer is computed first, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the outermost expression by multiplying the result by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer and make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final answer is 3 * 29524 =88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer, using the formula for the linear recurrence. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable, though time-consuming. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, finally, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous one. This looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer, 88572. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure that the result is consistent. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible. But just to satisfy my curiosity, let's see if we can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, +9000 = 88048. Then, +500 = 88548. Then, +24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, it seems my calculations are consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, these numbers look familiar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for L_n. Let's compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges. L_1 = 4 = 4. L_2 = 13. L_3 = 40. L_4 = 121. L_5 = 364. L_6 = 1093. L_7 = 3280. L_8 = 9841. L_9 = 29524. Wait, I recognize these numbers. They seem to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Let me test that: L_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Correct. L_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40. Correct. L_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121. Correct. Yes, so the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's efficient because it uses the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to ensure that I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Everything checks out. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1 \\), leading to the closed-form solution \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is more than 80000. Wait, 29524 is approximately 30,000, so 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. So, 29524 * 3 should be 88,572. Let me check that: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Because if any layer was computed incorrectly, it would throw off the entire result. Let me recompute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, hold on, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. But earlier, I had written 1,093 as Layer 6. Wait, but in my initial computation, I had written 1093 as Layer 6, which is correct because 1,093 is the same as 1093. So that's fine. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270; 3,270 +9=3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct, Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600; 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct, Layer 8 is 9,841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient and c is a constant. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^n - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1))*r^{n-1}. Wait, let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrence relations of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute A. For n=1: a_1 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r) = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3A + 1/(-2) = 3A - 1/2. But a_1 = 4, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. This matches my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could have directly calculated a_9 using the formula and then multiplied by 3. But since I already did the step-by-step computation, I think that's thorough enough. Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing the pattern of the nested expressions, computing each layer from the innermost outward, verifying each step to ensure accuracy, and then using a general formula to confirm the result. This approach helps prevent errors that might occur from repeatedly multiplying and adding without a clear structure. It's also a good reminder of how recurrence relations can be used to model such nested structures and how to solve them using standard techniques from discrete mathematics. So, in conclusion, after carefully working through each layer and verifying my computations, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next term. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost term is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This results in each layer being a term in a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a series, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29,524)=88,572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Wait, but actually, in the standard form, it's a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. Here, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the layers as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation: Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth layer is Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10 or something, but since the problem is asking to compute it, I think 88572 is the numerical answer. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. We can try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we computed earlier. Therefore, the 9th layer is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before. So, using the closed-form formula, we can see that the value is 88572 without computing each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine, it wasn't too bad. Alternatively, maybe recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression. Each L_n is 3 times the previous plus 1, so it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But in any case, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we arrive at the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, we can model this as a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence might give a closed-form formula, which could be useful for larger n without computing each term. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. This method is much faster, especially if there are more layers. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would save time if I had more layers. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, the nth layer is found to be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this results in 29524.

So, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

So, each layer builds upon the previous one correctly. I think that's the right approach. Another way to think about it is that each layer is following the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, you're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to a geometric series, but since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1.\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2.\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, matches Layer 3.\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct, matches Layer 4.\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, matches Layer 5.\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093.

Correct, matches Layer8.\nFor n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, matches Layer9.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression (Layer9) is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives us 88572. So, the final result is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. It's always reassuring to check using a different method. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). It's 9 opening parentheses, each starting with 1+3. So that's nine layers, which I've computed as Layer 1 through Layer 9. So I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's consider each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form approach, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n   29524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches the previous calculation. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because that seems quite large. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572 is the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n\n...\n\nHow many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1 + 3, each subsequent 1 + 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3 terms:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3(...)\n\n...\n\nUp to the 9th layer? Wait, let me see. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3 appears, excluding the outermost 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3 terms inside the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the 9th layer, as I had before. So, 9 layers, each computed correctly. Therefore, the final answer after multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again to see if I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the 9th layer is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check what 3^{10} is. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 once more.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000*3=87000.\n\n524*3=1572.\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after all these checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.

Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400; 29400 + 120=29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4=13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13=40. And so on. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which would make computing the layers faster, especially if there are more layers. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)}=A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2. Solving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2.

By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Applying this formula to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognize the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Solving this gives a general formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the ninth layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 would be more than 80,000? Wait, 30,000 * 3 is 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be around 88,572. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again more carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would be 88,572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back and check each layer computation because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong. Let me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside is 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the problem statement: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n4. 1+3(1+3(...\n5. 1+3(1+3(...\n6. 1+3(1+3(...\n7. 1+3(1+3(...\n8. 1+3(1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" inside each other, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, my initial approach was correct, computing each layer from 1 to 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that gives me Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B\nSimplify 3A*3^{n-1} to A*3^n:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, the innermost expression is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have 1+3( which is the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another 1+3(, that's the second layer.\n\nContinuing, each additional \"1+3(\" increases the layer count by 1.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there are 8 more \"1+3(\" instances, making it 9 layers in total, including the first one. So, n=9, which gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had miscounted and thought there were only 8 layers, I would have gotten a different answer, but since I carefully counted and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nSo, summarizing the steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward.\n\n2. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to compute the value more efficiently.\n\n3. Verify the result using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or see if there's a pattern that could be generalized, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. But just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can use. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Yep, it works. So, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Layer 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C * 3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C * 3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C * 3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   $1 + 3 = 4$\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1 (if we consider the innermost as a_1, but maybe starting differently). Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The solution is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + a_0*(k^{n})/k^{0}, but I might be mixing up the formula. Let me recall: For a linear recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + a_0*k^{n}. Wait, perhaps I should derive it. Let's consider the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1 (if we take the innermost term as a_1, but maybe a_0 is 1 + 3, which is 4). Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me instead compute the value for each layer using the recurrence and see if it aligns with the formula. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see: The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, for example, if we have n layers, the total would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1, but that's not exactly the case here because each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series. Let me try that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But that seems recursive. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), maybe I can express it as a sum. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer adds another term in a geometric progression. Let me try to see:\n\nIf I have the innermost layer as 4 (Layer 1: 1 + 3), then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nWait, let's try to find a general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of 3's in the expression. Each 3 is part of a multiplication, so each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses: Starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each layer wraps another (1+3(...)). So, the original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me check: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, from the innermost, it's:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we have \"1+3(\" and then another layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 layers of \"1+3(\", so n=9.\n\nThus, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach time we have a term like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer adds a term that is 3 times the previous one plus 1. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nBut using the formula we derived earlier, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n- Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n- The nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\n- Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\n- The entire expression is 3 times this value, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and using the recurrence relation and the geometric series approach both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By expanding each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value using the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. The nth layer's value is given by (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For 9 layers, this is (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you compute nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.

So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.

Let me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, wrapping around, 1 + 3*(...)\n3.

Each layer adds one more multiplication by 3. So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1 + 3(\" after the first one adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances.

But in my computation earlier, I went up to Layer 9, which would be 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost \"1 + 3\", that's Layer 1. Then, each time we go outward, we add another layer, so:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each computed step by step, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each layer step by step is feasible.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nIndeed, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, given the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe know B = -1/2, so:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I applied the formula correctly. For n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works, and thus a_9=29524 is correct, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which we computed as 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives me the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got this right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we derive a closed-form solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this for \\(n = 9\\) gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. I wonder if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking for a pattern, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. At n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^{10} = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression saved time and reduced the chance of error, especially if the number of layers were larger.

Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly and then plug into the formula. 3^1 =3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, regardless of the method, the result is the same. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, maybe using a different approach or verifying the multiplication. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, and L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1. So, let's compute each L(n) up to L(9). L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence, but in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. If it were a larger number of layers, I might look for a formula or a pattern to generalize it, but for nine layers, step-by-step computation is feasible.

Each layer is built upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each step is just 1 + 3*(previous result). It seems like a geometric progression or something similar, but since each step depends on the previous, it's just a matter of computing each step carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...))), it's a recursive expression where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since we only have nine layers. But just for knowledge, let's see:\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 as we computed.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, in our case, how many layers do we have? Let me check the original expression. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, counting the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the original expression has 9 opening parentheses before the innermost 1 + 3. So n = 9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was 1 + 3, which is the innermost, so that would correspond to n=1, giving a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is n=2, giving a_2 = 13, which matches our earlier computation. So for n=9, the value would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches Layer 9's value. So then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what we got earlier. So that's a good consistency check.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches our previous result. So that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step was manageable.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify one more layer. Let's say Layer 4: According to the formula, a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which matches our earlier computation. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. Maybe I can represent this recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nI can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nCompute a_1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers computed using the formula match my step-by-step calculations. Therefore, I'm confident that a_9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each time we have a term that's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote the innermost as 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the layers are:\n\n4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nAnd then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this multiple times now, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check the layers because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let's go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think my computation is accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.
