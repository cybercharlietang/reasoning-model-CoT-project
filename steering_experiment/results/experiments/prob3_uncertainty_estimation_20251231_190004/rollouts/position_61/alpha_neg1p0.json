    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the placement.

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives us 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, as that might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers.\n\nWait, the expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we calculated before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors, especially with multiple layers. It's always good to verify using both iterative computation and a formula-based approach to ensure the result is consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting from the innermost layer. By solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula for each layer, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the next inner layer. There are nine layers in total, with the outermost layer multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Define the Layers:**\n   Let \\( L_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost (n=1) to the outermost (n=9).\n\n3. **Recurrence Relation:**\n   Each layer follows the relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Solve the Recurrence:**\n   The recurrence \\( L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1 \\) is solved to find a closed-form solution:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute the Innermost Layers:**\n   Using the formula, compute each layer up to \\( L_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n6. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B = 4. Now, let's consider the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. The particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Wait, but that seems a bit messy because we're dealing with integers here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Let's compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern. L_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Let's see: 3^2 = 9, 9 + 4 = 13. Hmm, that's interesting. L_3 = 40. 3^3 = 27, 27 + 13 = 40. Wait, that seems to fit. So, L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}. Wait, but that might not be the case. Wait, let me check: L_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1? No, 3^1 is 3, plus 1 is 4. Correct. L_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13. Correct. L_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 13 = 27 + 13 = 40. Correct. L_4 = 121 = 3^4 + 40 = 81 + 40 = 121. Correct. So, it seems that L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. But wait, that can't be right because L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, not 3^n + L_{n-1}. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again. From the recurrence L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Let me compute L_n for n=1 to n=4: L_1 = 4. L_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. L_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40. L_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121. L_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364. L_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093. L_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280. L_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841. L_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Now, to find a closed-form expression, I can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1, L_1 = 4. But in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before. So, that seems to be the correct answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a repeating pattern that allows us to use a recurrence relation. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using the recurrence relation and solving for the closed-form expression, we find the value of the innermost layer and propagate outward. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\).

Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you compute nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula that could represent this expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms using the recurrence and see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation approach, we can solve for a_n. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, we can compute it using the formula: Total = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. But since the problem is only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step is manageable, even if a bit tedious.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 each time. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))). It's a bit tricky, but perhaps I can express it as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as S. So, S =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1 +3)...))) Let's see, if I expand S, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But each time, it's 1 +3*something. Wait, but this seems similar to the layers we computed earlier. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as S =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers. Wait, but since we already have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then S =3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, S=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step or using a derived formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^{10} is 59049, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer again to be absolutely sure. Let me do that. Layer 1:1+3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent.

Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Hmm, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug into the recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. Substitute the general solution: A*3^{n+1} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^n + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^n + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n+1} + 3B. So, left side: A*3^{n+1} + B. Right side: A*3^{n+1} + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^{n+1} + B = A*3^{n+1} + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^{n+1} from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 up to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check 29524 * 3 again. Maybe I can compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error in arithmetic when dealing with larger numbers. Let me recompute Layer 9 and then the multiplication. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs: 1+3, then 1+3, etc., up to nine times? Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1+3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each time we have another 1+3*(Layer n). So, the number of layers is 9, because the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(... nine times...))). So, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, Layer 1 = 4. Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can represent this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 1. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n. To find a particular solution, we can assume a constant solution Layer n = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: Layer 1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since we have Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. That's more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since I had only nine layers, both methods worked. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiply by 3. So, 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to approach it, recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, each layer can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For layer 9, this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000?

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or a recurrence relation, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: If I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, it's similar to a geometric series. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote L_k as the value at layer k. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^k, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition at k=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer k, the value is (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with k=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series or something similar? Maybe, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think I've double-checked it enough. The key was recognizing the recurrence relation and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form solution using the recurrence. Since the number of layers isn't too large, step-by-step computation is feasible, but for more layers, the closed-form formula would be more efficient. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. Either way, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digit positions. Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3: Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7. Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the innermost parentheses was 4, then each subsequent layer built upon that. So, the final result after computing all layers and then multiplying by 3 is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, starting from L1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, for n layers, the value would be L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 1? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think about the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let me plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + (1 + 3B). Therefore, B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: L1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, L2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, L3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version to see if the pattern holds. Let's take n=1: The expression would be 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Using the formula: L1=4, then 3*4=12. Correct. For n=2: 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. Using the formula: L2=13, 3*13=39. Correct. For n=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(13))=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. Using the formula: L3=40, 3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works for these smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9. Therefore, I can be sure that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we can compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation. 3. After computing all layers up to the 9th, multiply by 3. 4. To ensure correctness, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, which confirmed the result.

Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4*3=12, so write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.

Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computations. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, a_2=1 +3a_1, etc. So, in general, a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =3C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 =>4 =3A -1/2 =>3A=4 +1/2=9/2 =>A=(9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3,... up to a_9, because there are nine layers. Wait, let me count the layers again. The expression is 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1 +3(\" appears. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we have 1+3*(...). So, from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, the number of layers is 9, as the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572, which matches the earlier result. So, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which is reassuring.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression from the inside out, step by step, to confirm. Let me write each layer computation again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. That's another way to think about it, using the formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the correct result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before. So, this method also confirms the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's say Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Using the formula, L_3 should be (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Similarly, Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works, which gives me more confidence. Therefore, I can conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested structure from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.

The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, but since there are only nine terms, computing each step is straightforward.

Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long process. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That looks like a geometric series, but perhaps it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L_9. So, the problem is to compute L_9, and then multiply by 3. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers are integers. Maybe this approach isn't directly helpful, but perhaps we can adjust it. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each L_n step by step, as we did before, since n isn't too large. Alternatively, perhaps we can recognize the pattern as a base-3 number or something else. Alternatively, perhaps each L_n can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But L_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Wait, maybe a different formula. Let me compute L_n for a few more terms and see if a pattern emerges. We have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, L_4 = 121, L_5 = 364, L_6 = 1093, L_7 = 3280, L_8 = 9841, L_9 = 29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me see if each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. For example: L_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1? 3*4=12, 12 +1=13. Yes. L_3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1? 3*13=39 +1=40. Yes. L_4 = 121 = 3*40 +1? 3*40=120 +1=121. Yes. So, it seems that L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. Wait, but according to our earlier definition, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is the same as 3*L_{n-1} +1. So, yes, that's consistent. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p +1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p =1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire original expression as a sum of powers of 3, but given that we've already got a closed-form formula and verified it, perhaps that's sufficient. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Computed each layer step by step, ensuring each multiplication and addition was correct. 3. Derived a closed-form formula for the nth layer using recurrence relation techniques. 4. Verified the formula with known values to ensure correctness. 5. Applied the formula to find L_9, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. 6. Cross-checked the result with the step-by-step computation to ensure consistency.

    "text": " Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Let me verify that with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 +5=10, write 0 carry 1, 9 +9=18 +1=19, write 9 carry 1, 2 +2=4 +1=5. So, 59048. Then add 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524: 8 +4=12, write 2, carry 1. 4 +2=6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. 5 + carryover? Wait, no, actually, let's add digit by digit:\n\nStarting from units:\n8 (from 59048) +4 (from 29524) =12, write 2, carry 1.\nTens: 4 +2=6 +1=7, write 7.\nHundreds: 0 +5=5, write 5.\nThousands: 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\nTen-thousands:5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 59048 +29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29,524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88,572. I checked the multiplication by adding 29,524 three times, which confirmed that 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify by another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 500 = 88548. Then, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, we can express a_n as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0, where a_0 would be the initial term if we go back. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series starting from a_1. Alternatively, using the formula we found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which seems more straightforward. So, using this formula, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again to confirm. Let's compute a_1 to a_4 again: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, each step checks out. Therefore, the computation seems accurate. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Since there are nine layers, each layer corresponds to a power of 3. So, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))), which, when expanded, becomes 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9). Wait, but that might not be accurate because each layer is nested, not summed directly. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum. Let me think: Each time, the term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, expanding it, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9). Wait, but that would be 3 times the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k. Because 1 = 3^0, then 3^1, up to 3^9. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in this case, the sum from k=0 to 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, that's another way to see it, using the geometric series formula. Therefore, the answer is consistent. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate the coefficients: On the left side: A*3^n + B. On the right side: A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Therefore, equating term by term: A*3^n = A*3^n, which is fine. Then, constants: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each subsequent layer follows a pattern. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, each step is correct. Therefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I saw the expression, it starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for it. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, the final result is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, if I think about it as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each term is added to 1, it's a bit more involved. But the recurrence approach worked well, and the closed-form formula confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 29524.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something like that because this seems like a recursive pattern. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up the equations: 3A + B = 4, 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used the recursive formula, and even derived a general formula for the nth term, which all point to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled recursively. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads me to the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be modeled using a linear recurrence relation.

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me just think again: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then doing that again. So, in effect, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 4, then 13, then 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: if we have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) n times, there might be a formula for it. Let me recall that for such a linear nested structure, the value can be expressed as (a*(b^n - 1))/(b - 1). Wait, but let me check that. Let me consider a simpler case where n=1: it's just a + b*a = a*(1 + b). For n=2: a + b*(a + b*a) = a + b*a + b^2*a = a*(1 + b + b^2). Similarly, for n=3: a + b*(a + b*(a + b*a)) = a + b*a + b^2*a + b^3*a = a*(1 + b + b^2 + b^3). So, indeed, for n layers, it's a*(1 + b + b^2 + ... + b^{n}).\n\nWait, but in our problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so the a is 1, and b is 3. So, the total expression inside the outermost 3*(...) would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the total expression inside the outermost 3*() is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers, right? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, down to Layer 1: 1 + 3. So, if I think of each Layer k as 1 + 3*Layer_{k-1}, starting from Layer 1=4. So, with 9 layers, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*Layer8, etc. So, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Wait, if I let L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4, then L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. So, solving this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_k = C*3^{k} + D, where C and D are constants. Let's find C and D.\n\nGiven L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, we can write:\n\nL_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_k^p = D. Substituting into the equation:\n\nD - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check: if I use the formula for L_k, which is (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, then for k=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, but just computed each layer step by step, I still arrived at the same result, so that's good.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, if there were more layers, a formula would be more efficient. Let me try to derive a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, derived a formula, and confirmed that both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. By computing each layer step by step or using the derived formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation because if any of those layers were wrong, the final answer would be off. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write out the first few terms: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a0 + d*(c^{n-1} + c^{n-2} + ... + c + 1). In this case, c = 3, d = 1, and a1 = 4. Wait, but our initial term is a1 = 4. So, maybe the formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * a0 + 1*(3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3 + 1). But wait, a0 isn't given here. Alternatively, since the recursion starts at a1, maybe we can adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4. So, the closed-form solution would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1, but a1 is 4, so that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula. Since the expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 =88,572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

So, my initial approach was correct, with Layer 1 being the innermost, up to Layer 9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 3*(Layer 9) = 88572, but let me check if the layers are correctly computed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9, since we have 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial step-by-step computation, let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

So, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, yes, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.

    "text": " Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time another layer is added. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier computation of 9 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, to recap, I broke down the problem by recognizing the pattern, computed each layer step by step, verified with a recursive formula, and then used a closed-form expression to confirm the result. It all adds up to 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because all the methods led to the same answer, and I double-checked each step. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recursive pattern. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Using the recursive formula \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute up to \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Finally, multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, let me verify that. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Wait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given that each layer is defined recursively, computing each step one by one seems the most straightforward approach, especially since there are only nine layers. I don't think there's a shortcut formula here because each term is dependent on the previous one, but maybe there's a pattern in the numbers. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 I can see that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, each Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's consistent with how I computed each layer. So, if I wanted to generalize this, I could say that Layer n = (3^n) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see, for Layer 1: n=1, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but Layer 1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe another formula. Alternatively, perhaps each Layer n = 2*3^n - 1. Let me test that. For Layer 1: 2*3^1 -1 = 6 -1 =5, but Layer 1 is 4. Not quite. Layer 2: 2*3^2 -1=18-1=17, but Layer 2 is 13. Hmm, not matching. Maybe it's a different pattern. Let me think. Each Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that Layer 1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that when n=0, Layer 0 =1, because if we go back one step, before the innermost layer, it would be 1. So, Layer 0 =1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B =4 (from Layer 1) and A + B =1 (from Layer 0). Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2A =3 => A=3/2. Then, substituting back into A + B =1: 3/2 + B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers we have. For Layer 1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the general formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, in our case, Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the general formula checks out with each layer. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Compute each layer step by step:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000? Wait, 30,000 * 3 is 90,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be just under 90,000.

Wait, but let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another 3(...) and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses, each starting with 1+3. So, that means there are 9 layers, right? So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my previous calculation was correct, computing up to Layer 9, then multiplying by 3. So, the final answer is 88,572. Therefore, I think I've done this correctly. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say, instead of 9 layers, let's take 2 layers: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) According to my method: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Then multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39 Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Another test: 3 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Then 3*40 = 120. Direct computation: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for smaller cases, so I can be confident it's correct for the 9-layer problem.

Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach, even though it's a bit time-consuming. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something similar. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another condition to solve for A and B, but since the recurrence is first-order, we can find a pattern. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms and see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 4. a_2 = 13 = 9 + 4 = 13. a_3 = 40 = 27 + 13 = 40. a_4 = 121 = 81 + 40 = 121. Hmm, interesting. It seems that each a_n is 3^n + a_{n-1}, but wait, no, because 3^1 + a_0 would be 3 + a_0, but a_1 is 4, so a_0 would have to be 1. Let's see: If a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40. So yes, if we consider a_0=1, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_0=1. So, the general solution is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and an additional 1 is added each time. The formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we have. For n=0: a_0=1. Using the formula: (3^{1} -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. Correct. For n=1: a_1=4. Formula: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a series, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
