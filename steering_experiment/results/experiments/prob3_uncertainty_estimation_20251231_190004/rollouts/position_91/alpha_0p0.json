    "text": " Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms using the formula. If n=1, a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but wait, our a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a_n = (3^{n} + 1)/2. Let me test that. For n=1, (3 +1)/2=2, which is not 4. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3=40. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.

Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can try to find a general formula for a_n. Let me see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.

So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which is correct.

Let me check if I can express a_n in terms of a_1. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K.

Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n can be expressed in terms of a_{n-1}. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's solve for A and B. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a direct formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let's see. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me think of it as a geometric series. Each time, you have a term that is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, the expression can be written as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. Then, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}). Wait, but E_1 would be 3*(1) = 3, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, so perhaps my initial definition is off. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as a recurrence where each step is 1 + 3*previous, starting from 1 + 3. But as I've already found the formula for a_n, which is the value after n layers, and the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572, I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*a_9 again: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, and it still gives 88572.

So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049, 3^{11} = 177147. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's the same answer as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct because both methods, computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation, give the same result. So I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=0, I suppose L0 would be undefined, but perhaps we can find another way. Alternatively, let's consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the expansion would involve powers of 3. Let me try to write the entire expression out. Let's denote E as the entire expression: E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3 =4. Then, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, as I did before, E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me expand this step by step, but perhaps using the formula I found. Since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, and we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*L9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I expand E without using the formula, it would be tedious, but perhaps manageable. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let's denote each nested expression as follows: Let\u2019s define E1 =1+3=4 E2=1+3E1=1+12=13 E3=1+3E2=1+39=40 E4=1+3E3=1+120=121 E5=1+3E4=1+363=364 E6=1+3E5=1+1092=1093 E7=1+3E6=1+3279=3280 E8=1+3E7=1+9840=9841 E9=1+3E8=1+29523=29524 Then, E=3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, if I were to write E as a sum, it would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me expand each multiplication step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let's write E9=1+3=4. Then, E8=1 +3*E9=1+12=13. E7=1+3*E8=1+39=40. E6=1+3*E7=1+120=121. E5=1+3*E6=1+363=364. E4=1+3*E5=1+1092=1093. E3=1+3*E4=1+3279=3280. E2=1+3*E3=1+9840=9841. E1=1+3*E2=1+29523=29524. Then, E=3*E1=3*29524=88572. So, regardless of the method, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and we have nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to computing a_9 where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, and a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate to LHS: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 Now, using initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4 So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 Now, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, this seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as above. So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, for the recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + s*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check: If n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, using the formula, we arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct.

The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, but actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Therefore, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, that's consistent. Now, since each layer is defined by L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, and we have 9 layers, starting from L1 to L9. So, the expression is 3*L9, which we found to be 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_k. Since L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.

Let me see if I can find a general formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.

Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume the solution is of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Now, set equal to left side: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values.

Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.

Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and each time, it's just 1 + 3*previous. After computing up to the ninth layer, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result, 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result without computing each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^{10} = 59049 Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1, which gives B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's consistent with my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3.

Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see, starting from the innermost term: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I consider the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 3*(1 + 3*S'), where S' is the next layer. But actually, each layer is similar, so perhaps the entire expression can be represented recursively.

Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation. The general formula for such a recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 - c/(k-1))*(k)^{n-1} + c/(k-1). In this case, k=3, c=1. So, a_n = (a_1 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1). Given that a_1 = 4, so a_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I had a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So maybe my formula is wrong. Let me check. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The standard solution method for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That might be a quicker way if I recognize the pattern. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step without too much trouble, it's reassuring that both methods give the same answer. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence goes: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed in a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this works for n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers. But since we have only 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable.

So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be expressed as a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. So, in our case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, this alternative method using the recurrence relation confirms the earlier result.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants.

Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me define L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. And the recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). If we assume L(n) = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L(1) = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) =3 *29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also think about this in terms of a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be seen as a geometric series with ratio 3. The closed-form formula I found earlier is essentially the sum of a geometric series. So, it all checks out.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.

Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C.

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me consider what's happening here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the term before. This is a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in our case, c = 3 and d = 1, but our starting point is a_1 = 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4, the solution can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But in our case, a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my initial conditions are different. Wait, let me think again. The standard solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). In our case, k=3, c=1, and a_1=4. So, perhaps a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial term is a_1=4, which would correspond to n=1. So, perhaps a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} -1)/2. But a_0 would be the term before a_1. Since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, and a_1=4, then 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So a_0=1. Therefore, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(1) + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying that: a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by manually computing each layer. So, this formula approach confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't remember the formula, I could have noticed the pattern in the a_n terms and derived it on the spot. But since I remembered that the solution to a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c -1), I could apply that here. Either way, the answer comes out to be 88572. Just to make sure, let me verify the multiplication step again: 29524 *3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 + 3 times the result of the next inner layer. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, the nth term is found to be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more formally. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3L_p = 1 => -2L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So that confirms my earlier calculation.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to find the sum without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572 So, the pattern is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if I have nine layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's nine layers. So, yes, a_9 is the outermost layer, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*(a_9) = 3*(29524) = 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, if I were to write this as a sum, it would be a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. The formula I derived earlier seems to be the way to go. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the layer number.

    "text": " Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.

Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is defined by L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recursive formula, or using the closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but perhaps it's overcomplicating for this problem since there are only nine layers. But just for curiosity, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.
