So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I could have used this formula from the start to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. That might have saved time, especially if the number of layers was larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we can write this as a linear recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, I can directly compute a_9 and then multiply by 3. Either way, I get the same result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation. 3. Realize that the expression fits a recurrence relation and derive a formula for the nth term. 4. Use the formula to compute the 9th term efficiently. 5. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 6. Verify the computations at each step to ensure accuracy. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations to simplify the computation. It also emphasized the importance of careful step-by-step calculation, especially with multiple layers of nesting.

So I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis kind of recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. The initial condition is a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series might also help, but in this case, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, so I'm confident in this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. Alternatively, this looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. It's a recursive expression. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is our Layer 1. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's similar but with d = 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = k^n*a_0 + d*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). In our case, k = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, but our initial term is a_1 = 4, so maybe we need to adjust the formula to start from n=1. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe it's better to index the terms starting from n=0. Let me try that. Let\u2019s define a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, which would correspond to Layer 1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4. Then, the solution for this recurrence relation can be found as follows. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_0 = 4: 4 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 4 = A - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, we can write this as a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Now, let's check this with our earlier calculations to make sure it's correct. For n=0: a_0 = (9*3^0 - 1)/2 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=1: a_1 = (9*3^1 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9*9 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, which is Layer 9, let's compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (9*3^9 - 1)/2. First, compute 3^9. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683. So, 3^9 = 19683. Then, 9*19683 = let's compute that. 10*19683 = 196830, subtract 19683: 196830 - 19683 = 177147. So, 9*19683 = 177147. Then, 177147 - 1 = 177146. Now, divide by 2: 177146 / 2 = 88573. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got a_9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But according to this formula, a_9 = 88573. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, no, the formula gives a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (9*3^9 -1)/2. 3^9 is 19683, so 9*19683 is 177147. Then, 177147 -1 = 177146. Divided by 2 is 88573. But according to my step-by-step computation, a_9 was 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572, but according to the formula, a_9 is 88573. So, there's a discrepancy of 1. That means I must have made a mistake in either the formula or in my step-by-step computation. Let me check my step-by-step computation again. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the formula, a_9 = 88573. So, there's a problem here. Either the formula is wrong, or my step-by-step computation is wrong. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula was derived for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4. The solution was a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. Let me test for n=0: a_0 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=2: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. n=3: (9*27 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=4: (9*81 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=5: (9*243 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=6: (9*729 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=7: (9*2187 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=8: (9*6561 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. n=9: (9*19683 -1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. So, according to the formula, a_9=88573, but in my step-by-step, I have a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. Wait, that suggests that the formula is giving a_9=88573, which is the value after multiplying by 3? No, wait, the formula gives a_n as the value of each layer. So, a_9=88573 would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*88573=265719. But that contradicts my earlier computation. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, I'm confused now. Let me clarify: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572. But according to the formula, a_n is defined as Layer n, which is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_9=29524, which is Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. But according to the formula, a_9=(9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. So, why is there a discrepancy? Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula was derived for a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_0=4. So, a_0=4, a_1=13, a_2=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. But according to the formula, a_9=(9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. That's not matching. So, where did I go wrong? Let me recast the problem. The formula I derived was for a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=4. The solution is a_n=(9*3^n -1)/2. Let me compute a_9 using this formula: 3^9=19683, 9*19683=177147, 177147-1=177146, 177146/2=88573. So, a_9=88573. But according to my step-by-step computation, a_9=29524. There's a clear discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake in either the formula or in the step-by-step computation. Let me check the step-by-step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, a_9=29524, but according to the formula, it's 88573. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Let me rederive the formula to see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWe have the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply the initial condition a_0=4: 4 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 4 = A - 1/2 => A=4 + 1/2=9/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's what I had before. So, according to this, a_9 should be (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573.\n\nBut according to my step-by-step, a_9=29524.\n\nWait, perhaps I misindexed the layers. Let me check: In the formula, n starts at 0 with a_0=4, which is Layer 1. So, in the formula, a_0 corresponds to Layer 1, a_1 corresponds to Layer 2, up to a_8 corresponds to Layer 9.\n\nWait, that's probably where I went wrong. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a_0 corresponds to Layer 1, then a_8 would correspond to Layer 9, since we start counting from 0.\n\nSo, in the formula, a_n is Layer (n+1). Therefore, to get Layer 9, we need a_8.\n\nLet me compute a_8 using the formula: a_8=(9*3^8 -1)/2.\n\n3^8=6561, so 9*6561=59049, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2=29524.\n\nYes! So, a_8=29524, which is Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572, which matches my step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, the confusion was in the indexing. The formula gives a_n for n starting at 0, which corresponds to Layer 1, so Layer 9 is a_8.\n\nTherefore, the correct value is a_8=29524, and the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, to summarize, by using the formula, I correctly found that Layer 9 is a_8=29524, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, without using the formula, by computing each layer step by step, I also arrived at 88572, which confirms the result.\n\nI think that's solid now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because that's where errors usually happen. Let's recompute each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help confirm this result. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to L(9). So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is feasible. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let's see: The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.

Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. Wait, no, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c=3 and d=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But just for practice, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\). Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer up to the ninth one, then multiply the result by 3. Alternatively, using a derived formula, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's another way to approach it. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Let's see if the closed-form formula works. Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, for n=1: 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=2: a_2=13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B =13 Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: 6A =9 => A= 9/6= 3/2=1.5. Now, substitute A into equation 1: 3*(1.5) + B =4 => 4.5 + B=4 => B=4 -4.5= -0.5. So the closed-form formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 0.5 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^2)/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it would have given the same result. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.

That seems consistent. Wait, but let me check Layer 5 again: Layer 4 is 121, so Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence. The general formula for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see: For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But our a_1 is 4, so that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Now, to find a closed-form formula for a_n, let's consider the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 +840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step because doing it manually for nine layers is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where in this case, k=3 and c=1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation. The formula is:\n\na_n = (a_1 + c/(k - 1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k - 1)\n\nWait, let me verify that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution approach.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution, a_p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let\u2019s assume a_p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, which also gives the same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be modeled using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence provides a formula to compute the value efficiently without manually expanding each layer. Applying this formula confirms the result obtained by step-by-step expansion.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's try to model this. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a pattern here. Let me compute the first few terms again: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. But maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. Let's plug in n = 1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find C. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach also led me to the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, for n >= 2, with L1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. So, 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with nine layers, which is 3*L9, and L9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 *3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524=88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but let me think again. Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So this is similar to a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Here, n is 9, because I count nine layers from the innermost to the outermost. So maybe there's a formula for this. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So if I denote L_k as the value at layer k, then L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, L_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_k. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1=4. Let me compute L_2=1 +3*4=13, L_3=1 +3*13=40, L_4=1 +3*40=121, etc. Hmm, this seems similar to a geometric progression but with a constant term added each time. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} => A*3^{k} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B. So, A*3^{k} + B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{k} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1=4. When k=1, L_1= A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 =4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So Layer 9 corresponds to k=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step calculation. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I did everything correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula and see if it matches. For k=1: L1=(3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct. For k=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L3=(81-1)/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L4=(243-1)/2=121. Correct. For k=5: L5=(729-1)/2=364. Correct. For k=6: L6=(2187-1)/2=1093. Correct.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as a single formula. Let's see. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me denote this as E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me see how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer, so starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...). Wait, from the original expression, starting after the first 3*(, there are 9 layers. So, n=9. So, using the formula we found, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so E =3*L_n =3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, E=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer. But since I'm just starting out, maybe the step-by-step layer approach is clearer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. 1.

Now, adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote the layers as a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, when n=1, a_1 = 4. But according to our general form, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of a formula, it would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be straightforward. Alternatively, if I had more layers, I might look for a pattern or formula. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers. The values for each layer are: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Looking at these numbers, I can see that each layer is roughly multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - c/(b-1)) * r^{n-1} + c/(b-1), where the recurrence is a_n = b*a_{n-1} + c. In this case, b=3 and c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1) = (a_1 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. But since a_1 = 4, which is the innermost layer, let's see: a_1 = 4 = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Then, for Layer 2, n=2: a_2 = (4 - 1/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I computed Layer 2 as 13, not 11. Hmm, so maybe my general formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the indexing is off. Maybe the innermost layer is a_1, then each subsequent layer is a_2, etc., up to a_9. So, let's try again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which matches. So, the general formula should fit this. Let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using the formula. Since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(something). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find C and D. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Therefore, we have: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtracting C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula, I was able to compute the final value. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation helped simplify the problem. Instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with more layers, using a formula makes it much more efficient. However, in this case, since there were only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general approach for more complex problems. I think I've got a solid understanding of how to tackle this type of nested expression now. It's all about identifying the pattern and then applying the appropriate method, whether it's iterative computation or finding a closed-form solution. So, yeah, I feel confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but it's always a good idea to double-check, especially when dealing with multiple layers and large numbers. But in this case, both methods led me to the same result, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Adding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Hundreds: 0 + 5 = 5. Thousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. Ten-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let's see, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is building a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more involved. However, the recursive approach and the closed-form solution both lead to the same result, so I think I'm solid here. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step, verifying each step, and then finding a general formula to confirm the result, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, layer n has value (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. I think I understand it better now. So, the key was recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula for each layer, which saved a lot of time instead of computing each layer manually. It's interesting how recognizing patterns can simplify the problem-solving process. I should remember that for future problems\u2014look for patterns, recurrences, or known formulas that might apply.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to, I could have computed a_9 using the formula directly without computing each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute them one by one. I think I've double-checked my work enough times, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Adding up: 70,000 + 18,000 = 88,000. 88,000 + 1,000 = 89,000. 89,000 + 60 = 89,060. 89,060 + 12 = 89,072. Wait, that doesn't match the earlier digit-by-digit result. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check where I went wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it out: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). So the number is 88572. But when I added 29,524 three times, I got 89,072. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in my addition. Let me try adding 29,524 + 29,524 again. 29,524 + 29,524: Let's add units: 4 + 4 = 8. Tens: 2 + 2 = 4. Hundreds: 5 + 5 = 10. Thousands: 9 + 9 = 18. Ten-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4. So writing it out: 4 (ten-thousands), 18 (thousands), 10 (hundreds), 4 (tens), 8 (units). Wait, that's 4 18 10 4 8. But we need to carry over the extra digits. So starting from the right: Units: 8. Tens: 4. Hundreds: 10, so write down 0 and carry over 1. Thousands: 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9 and carry over 1. Ten-thousands: 4 + 1 = 5. So the sum is 59,048. Now, adding another 29,524 to 59,048: 59,048 + 29,524. Let's add each digit: Units: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Hundreds: 0 + 5 = 5. Thousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1. Ten-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So the sum is 88,572. Wait, that's matching the digit-by-digit multiplication. So my initial addition was wrong because I miscalculated the carry-over. So, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So that should be the final answer. Let me just verify each layer computation to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f Multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, all the steps check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me check if each layer's computation is correct. Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be the correct result. Wait, but let me think again about the structure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, after computing the innermost layer as 4, each subsequent layer adds more, and finally, we multiply the ninth layer by 3. So, yes, 88572 is the correct answer. I think I did it correctly. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation approach, we also arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Let me see: Let's expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: a_1 = 1 + 3\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each a_n is the sum of a geometric series: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Let me check:\n\nFor a_1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k is (3^2 -1)/(3 -1) = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k is (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k is (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is the same as the solution we found earlier. Therefore, for a_9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original problem has nine layers, but when we started counting from a_1 as the innermost, that's correct. So, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer step by step. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. It's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1). Let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is our Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth, resulting in 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times this value, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. For n = 1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n = 2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging into the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, maybe expanding the entire expression step by step, but that would probably be more time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something, but in this case, the recurrence seems more straightforward. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

After computing all nine layers, we find the value at the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, 9+9=18, 2+2=4. So that would be 59048. Then add 59048 + 29524: 8+4=12, 4+2=6, 0+5=5, 9+9=18, 5+2=7, 0+ nothing=0. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the addition. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and check my layers because I think I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, but when I started computing, I went up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): Starting from the innermost, each parenthesis adds one. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time after the 3, there's an opening parenthesis. Let me count them: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. So, that means there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct, and then I multiplied by 3, which is the outermost 3. So, my calculation should be correct. But just to be thorough, let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Each term is 1 + 3*(next term). If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be expanded as 3 + 9 + 27 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, no, actually, each layer adds another 3 times something, but it's not exactly a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Hmm, maybe not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward. In any case, both methods I've used so far give me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Multiply by 3: 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Wait, maybe I can model this as a geometric sequence. Let me see: Let's denote the innermost term as L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution is Ln = a^n * L0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. Wait, no, in our case, it's Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, which can be rewritten as Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. So, a = 3, b = 1. The general solution for this is Ln = (Ln-1)*3 + 1. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using this formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L9), and L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. That's a much faster method, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case I have to solve a similar problem with more layers. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence and solving it using the formula for such a sequence, I was able to compute the value efficiently. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also gave me the same result, so both methods are valid. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for a linear recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Define Layers**: Let L1 be the innermost layer, L2 the next, up to L9 (the outermost layer).\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13\n   - L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40\n   - L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 121\n   - L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 364\n   - L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1093\n   - L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 3280\n   - L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 9841\n   - L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 29524\n\n4. **Use the Formula**: The nth layer can be expressed as Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 = 1,428. So 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me consider that each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L(1) = 4, L(2) = 13, L(3) = 40, etc., as I computed before. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. For L(1), (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For L(2), (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For L(3), (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, yes, the formula L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 works for each layer. So, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's exactly what I got when I computed layer 9 manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59,049 - 1)/2 = 3*59,048/2 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression involving multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.
