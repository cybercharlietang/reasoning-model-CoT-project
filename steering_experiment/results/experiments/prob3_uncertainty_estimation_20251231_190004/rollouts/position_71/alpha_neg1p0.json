    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So, 59048. Now, add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again to verify: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, it seems I did it correctly. Therefore, the computed value is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's possible here. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, in this case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the innermost part, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. This process is repeated nine times, resulting in the value 29524 for the innermost layer. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3... So from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Each layer adds another 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers. So, Layer1: 4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572.

So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, all the layers check out.

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression. But since I've already solved it using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I think I'm solid here. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but it's always good to be thorough. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is a simple multiplication and addition, so as long as I didn't make any arithmetic errors, this should be correct. Let me just check one more time the multiplication step because that's where I sometimes make mistakes. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Perfect, that's the same as before. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is when L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The characteristic equation would be r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, a particular solution can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. Let me try to expand it a bit. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since each layer is similar, maybe I can find a pattern. Alternatively, since I have a formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then E = 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can think of a different approach. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's possible here. Let me consider the expression inside out. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute a_9 more quickly. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution to such an equation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => Subtract 3A from both sides: -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve this, we can look for a pattern or solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me double-check because it's easy to miscount with so many layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are nine 1+3 terms, each nested inside the next. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the outermost one, which is correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these kinds of nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, in our case, we have 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, up to layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so expanding that, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so a_0 would be 1, perhaps? Wait, let's see: If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. But a_1 = 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, which is a geometric series sum. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the same as before. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step without using the formula, just to confirm. Let's do that again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula using the geometric series give the same result.

Let me see for n=1: L_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but L_1 is 4. So that formula doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's compute the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, if I expand the expression, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This seems like an infinite geometric series if it goes on forever, but in this case, it's finite with nine layers. So, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, because each layer adds another power of 3. Wait, let me check that. If Layer 1 is 1 + 3, that's 1 + 3^1. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 + 3 + 3^2. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) =1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds another term, so Layer n would have terms up to 3^{n}. Therefore, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, which is 3, and n is the number of terms. Here, the number of terms from 3^0 to 3^8 is 9 terms. So, S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier, Layer 9 was 29524. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers here. Because the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 itself is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which is similar to the sum up to 3^8, but maybe the total expression is 3 times that sum. Wait, no, let me think again. If I have S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, then S = (3^9 -1)/2, which is 9841. But in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). But Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. Wait, but according to the formula I derived earlier, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, which is correct because 3*(Layer 9) is 3*(29524) =88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k), but that might not be accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which actually forms a sum up to 3^{n} where n is the number of layers. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if I can express the entire expression as a sum. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as S, which is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, if I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Because each time you go out a layer, you're adding another 3^k term, up to 3^8. So, the sum inside is S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. The sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 to 3^8, which is 9 terms. So, S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2=9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*S =3*9841=29523. Wait, but earlier I got 88572. That's a discrepancy. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is 3*(Layer 9). But Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. So, the sum inside is not just up to 3^8, but each layer is multiplied by 3. Wait, perhaps my initial approach is better. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write the entire expression as a sum: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Now, let's expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nFinally, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then perhaps E can be expressed in terms of itself, but since it's finite, it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model it as a finite geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then each layer adds another 3^k term. So, expanding it, E = 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Because each layer adds a term that's 3 times the previous layer, which is 3^k for k from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, the sum inside is S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8.\n\nAs I computed earlier, S = (3^9 -1)/2 =9841.\n\nThen, E =3*S=3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier result of 88572. So, where's the mistake here?\n\nWait a minute, I think I'm confusing the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3 followed by 1 + 3(...). Then, inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. So, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1 +3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 is the 9th layer, and the outermost expression is 3 times that.\n\nWait, so in the sum approach, the sum S inside is up to 3^8 because Layer9 is 1 +3*(Layer8), which would correspond to 3^8 term.\n\nWait, but when I computed E as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), that gave me E=3*(9841)=29523, but when I computed step by step, I got E=88572.\n\nSo, clearly, one of these is wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the layers correspond to exponents correctly. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time you have a layer, it's 1 +3*(previous). So, each layer adds a term of 3^{n}, but starting from n=0.\n\nWait, let me think of the layers as:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4=3^1 +1?\n\nWait, no, 1 +3=4, which is 3^1 +1.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*4=13=3^2 +3 +1.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1.\n\nSo, Layer n is equal to sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, that can't be, because for Layer1, it's 4=1+3= sum from k=0 to1 of 3^k=1+3=4.\n\nLayer2=13=1+3+9= sum from k=0 to2 of 3^k=13.\n\nLayer3=40=1+3+9+27=40.\n\nWait, 1+3+9+27=40? Wait, 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40. Yes.\n\nSo, Layer n= sum from k=0 to n of 3^k= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer9= sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k= (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step calculation.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of the sum up to 3^8, I got 9841, and 3*9841=29523, which is different. So, where was I wrong?\n\nI think the confusion was in the number of layers. The expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), each adding another term in the sum. So, the innermost is 1+3=4, which is 3^1 +1. Then each layer adds another power of 3, so Layer9 is the sum up to 3^9, which is 3^10 -1 over 2.\n\nWait, no, actually, Layer1= sum up to 3^1, Layer2= sum up to 3^2, etc., up to Layer9= sum up to 3^9. So, the sum inside is up to 3^9, which is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier when I thought of the sum up to 3^8, I was miscalculating the number of layers. The expression has nine layers, so the sum goes up to 3^9, hence Layer9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, to summarize, the approach is to recognize that each layer is a sum of a geometric series up to 3^n, where n is the layer number, and then compute accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, using the step-by-step approach, computing each layer from the innermost outwards, as I did initially, gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through the problem, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern in each layer. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer and working outward. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, it would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572 as the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same place. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that I can recognize to solve it more quickly. Each layer seems to be following the pattern of a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, we have: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3C => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, that confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the closed-form formula to compute a_9 directly, which might have saved some time. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step without errors, both methods led me to the same result. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = 29524, as we found, so multiplying by 3 gives the result. Therefore, the problem is solved, and the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can compute the expression another way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm ready to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in the computation. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting over, just to be sure: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0)*(r)^n, but wait, that formula is for a geometric series when the recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. Wait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me check that. If I have a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, then the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying initial conditions, say a_0, then a_0 = A + c/(1 - r) => A = a_0 - c/(1 - r). Therefore, a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r) = a_0*r^n - c/(1 - r)*(r^n - 1). Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me see. Alternatively, the formula is a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r). So, in our case, a_0 would be the initial term. Wait, in our problem, the first term is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So maybe a_0 is 1? Let me clarify. Let me define a_0 as 1, so that a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, with a_0 = 1, then the general solution would be a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r). Here, c = 1, r = 3. So, a_n = (1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 1/(1 - 3). Simplify: 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, a_n = (1 - (-1/2)) * 3^n + (-1/2) = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier layers. For n=0, a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct. For n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6, a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7, a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8, a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, using this formula, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. I can cross-verify with the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it together: 88572. Correct. So, yes, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step, which would throw off all subsequent layers. Let's go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all layers seem to compute correctly. I think I did this right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for expressions like this. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, but in this case, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, it's a recursive expression. Let me consider that each layer n is equal to 1 + 3*layer(n+1). So, starting from layer 1, which is 1 + 3, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), and so on. So, in general, layer k = 1 + 3*layer(k-1), with layer 1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, layer 1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Wait, but if I think of it as a recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a formula for layer k. Let's denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming L_k^{(p)} = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier values to see if it works. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, because that might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me see if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about how such a series would behave. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify once again using the formula. The formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3( L1 )\n\nWhere L1 = 1 + 3( L2 )\n\nL2 = 1 + 3( L3 )\n\nL3 = 1 + 3( L4 )\n\nL4 = 1 + 3( L5 )\n\nL5 = 1 + 3( L6 )\n\nL6 = 1 + 3( L7 )\n\nL7 = 1 + 3( L8 )\n\nL8 = 1 + 3( L9 )\n\nL9 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total, with L9 being the innermost. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, after computing L9, which is 4, then L8 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, L7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to L1 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*L1 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recompute each layer step by step to avoid any mistakes:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can look for a pattern or formula that could compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or using recursion.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result without computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier, but since I was unsure, computing each layer step by step was a good approach. It's always good to verify the result using a different method to ensure accuracy.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 and see if it aligns with my previous calculations.\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer matches the formula, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer and eventually compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because that seems quite a big number, and I'm not sure if I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum involving powers of 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost term, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and adds 1. So, expanding the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it all the way, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1, but wait, that might not be accurate because each term is nested, not summed directly. Wait, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me try to express E in terms of itself, but I think that might not be straightforward because each layer is only one step. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, as I did before, and a_9 is 29524, so E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods lead me to the same result. I think I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the 9th layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term).

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I computed before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, I can find the closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's nonhomogeneous, I might need to find a particular solution as well. Alternatively, since it's a simple linear recurrence, I can solve it iteratively. Let's try to express a_n in terms of a_{n-1}, and so on. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\na_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_{n-2}\nSubstituting back:\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 9*a_{n-2}\nSimilarly, a_{n-2} = 1 + 3*a_{n-3}\nSo, a_n = 1 + 3 + 9*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*a_{n-3}\nContinuing this pattern, it seems that each time we substitute, we add another power of 3 multiplied by 1. So, in general, after k substitutions, a_n = (1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{k}) + 3^{k}*a_{n - k -1}\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n = 9. So, for a_9, we can express it as:\n\na_9 = (1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561) + 3^9 * a_0\n\nWait, but a_0 isn't defined in our original problem. Let me check. Our initial term was a_1 = 4, corresponding to the innermost layer. So, maybe a_0 is 1? Because if we think of a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, then a_0 would have to be 1 to make a_1 = 4. Let's test that:\n\nIf a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 4, then 3*a_0 = 3, so a_0 = 1. That makes sense.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\na_n = (1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n-1}) + 3^n * a_0\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_n is built from a_{n-1}, so for n layers, the sum would be from k=0 to k=n-1 of 3^k, and then multiplied by a_0. Let me verify.\n\nFrom the substitution earlier, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * a_0\n\nSince a_0 = 1, this becomes a_n = (sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k) + 3^n\n\nBut wait, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is a geometric series. The sum is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n - 1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3^n + 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Let me test it with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. But we know a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, perhaps my substitution was incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me try again.\n\nFrom the substitution, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * a_0\n\nBut a_0 =1, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n\n\nSum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k is (3^n - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n - 1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3^n + 1)/2\n\nBut when n=1, this gives (3 +1)/2=2, which is not equal to a_1=4. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different because each substitution adds a term, but perhaps I need to adjust for the initial condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4.

So yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the layers follow this recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me compute it again using the formula: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572.

Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, my calculations seem correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step, in case there's a smarter way. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think I've considered multiple approaches: computing each layer step by step, recognizing the recurrence relation, solving the recurrence, and verifying with the formula. All methods lead to the same final result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a bit tedious, but since the problem is finite and each step is straightforward, it's manageable. I just need to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid arithmetic errors. Overall, breaking it down layer by layer and using both iterative computation and a formulaic approach helped me confirm the answer. I feel pretty confident that 88572 is the correct result for this expression.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation would be r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers.

So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572 as I computed earlier. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 where each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution comes from the associated homogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I can compute a_n directly without having to compute each layer step by step. This would be especially useful if the expression had more layers, as it would save a lot of time. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad either way. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved some computation, but stepping through each layer is also a solid approach, especially if you're not sure about the underlying formula. In any case, both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result. It's always good to verify your work, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. It's easy to make a small arithmetic mistake, so checking each step helps ensure accuracy. Another thing I might consider is using a table to keep track of each layer's value, which can help prevent confusion and ensure that each step is correct. But in this case, since I was just computing each layer one by one, it worked out fine. I suppose the key takeaway here is recognizing the recursive structure of the expression and understanding how each layer builds upon the previous one. Once I saw that each layer was following a specific pattern, it became easier to handle, even if the numbers got large. Also, knowing that this kind of recursive relation can be solved with a formula is pretty handy. It might not always be necessary, but it's a useful tool to have in your mathematical toolkit. In summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute the value step by step and then verify it using a formula. This approach not only helps in solving the problem but also builds confidence in the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Recognizing the recursive nature, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation and Answer:\n\nWe need to compute the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet's denote each nested expression as a layer, starting from the innermost:\n\n- **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n- **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n- **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n- **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n- **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n- **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me try an alternative approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, yes, that's the same as before. Then the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's find another equation. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 9A + B = 13 (from n=2) Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for L_9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.
