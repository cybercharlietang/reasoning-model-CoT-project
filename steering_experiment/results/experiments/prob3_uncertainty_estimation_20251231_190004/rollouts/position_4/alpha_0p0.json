    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of terms, each being 1 plus 3 times another expression. It seems like a repeated pattern, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and compute each layer step by step. So, I'll start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and then work my way outwards.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time I see \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many times this nesting occurs. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think there are nine layers of nesting. Let me check:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. Let me confirm by counting the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections.\n\nWait, maybe I should just proceed step by step without worrying about the exact number of layers. Let's start evaluating from the innermost parentheses.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). So, let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, let's do each step:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers I have here. From the innermost, I did 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But looking back at the original expression, I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards.\n\nWait, but when I did my steps, I went from 1 + 3 once, then again, etc., up to 9 times? Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, no, when I did the steps above, I went up to 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). But perhaps the original expression has 9 layers, so I did 9 computations. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier because when I computed up to Layer 9, I had 29524, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to multiply that result by 3.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in my earlier steps, I went up to 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524, which would be Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nWait, so perhaps I miscalculated earlier by stopping at Layer 9 without multiplying by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, let me try again, this time keeping track of whether I've accounted for the outermost 3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let me break down 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I correctly accounted for all layers. I had 9 layers inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, the total number of layers inside is 9, each adding a new 1 + 3*(...). So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, 3*364 is 1,092? Let me check: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Yes, correct. So, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 +9=3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524, which we computed as 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: each time, we're computing 1 + 3*(previous result), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me consider the general form: Let\u2019s say we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))) with n layers. The value can be computed recursively, but perhaps there's a closed-form formula.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after n layers, the value is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nWait, this resembles a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value after n layers. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works. So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), we can write it as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me check 3^{11} again. 3^10 is 59,049, so 3^11 is 59,049 * 3 = 177,147. Then, 177,147 - 3 = 177,144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a term in a geometric progression, and the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ), which simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've double-checked each step, used a formula approach, and confirmed the result using two different methods. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\). This recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nThe general solution for the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) is:\n\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 9 \\) layers, we compute:\n\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\frac{59048}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a recursive structure, so maybe I can solve it from the inside out.

Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Wait, let me check: the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now that part simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so now that part becomes 40. Next layer out is again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*40.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, this seems to be following a pattern. Let me see: each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that in the next layer. So, maybe I can keep doing this step by step until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nLet me list each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait a minute, but hold on. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, I think I have 9 layers to compute, each time moving outward.\n\nWait, but when I listed the steps above, I only went up to 10 steps, but maybe I miscounted. Let me recount.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer from the inside. Then each step outwards is a layer. So, let's count each step carefully.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer inside the first 3(...), we then multiply this result by 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, each layer adds another 3*(...) and then adds 1. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, that is the value inside the first 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524).\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 layers, but perhaps that was a miscalculation. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) + 1. So, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, Layer 4 is 121, Layer 5 is 364, Layer 6 is 1093, Layer 7 is 3280, Layer 8 is 9841, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was listing the steps up to 10, I had 88573. That must have been a mistake because I think I incorrectly included an extra layer.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous) +1, so up to Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 10 layers, which might have been an error. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time it's 1 + 3*(...), and this happens 8 more times, so total 9 layers inside the first 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 9 layers deep, right? Because each time you go in, you have another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times '1 + 3(' occurs.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...))\n10. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers where each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but the innermost is just (1 + 3). So, perhaps I have 9 layers inside the first 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, and then the outermost expression is 3*(E9).\n\nSo:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did 10 steps, I ended up with 88573, which is off by 1. So, I think that was a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me confirm each step:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the calculations. Let me double-check a few steps.\n\nFor example, E5: 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next layer: \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer by multiplying the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested set of operations where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). It seems like a recursive structure, where each inner expression is similar to the outer one. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine layers here. Each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). Let me confirm that:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, if I start from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, that's the simplest part. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3(Layer 9)\n\nWait, actually, when I look again, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, the entire expression is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So, perhaps the layers are as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that makes sense. There are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me write down each layer's computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't miss any layers, let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) (Layer 4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) (Layer 5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) (Layer 6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) (Layer 7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) (Layer 8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) (Layer 9)\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*(Layer 9). So, 9 layers inside, plus the outermost multiplication. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is a nested multiplication where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the sequence is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the value we're looking for is 3*a_9.\n\nTo solve this recurrence relation, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, this method also confirms that the result is 88572. It's a bit more advanced, but it shows that recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation can lead to a direct formula, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me try that approach.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, but with an added constant. The formula I derived earlier handles that.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to expand the entire expression step by step, but that might be tedious with nine layers. Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, as before, and since I have a formula for a_n, I can plug in n=9 to get the value.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. Each step seems consistent, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))$\n\nHmm, I can see that each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something.

(1 + 3*(...))\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet's start with the innermost layer, which is step 1:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3)\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, step 1 result: 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, step 2 is:\n\nStep 2: Compute (1 + 3*(step 1 result))\nWhich is (1 + 3*4).

Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check:\n\n3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Yes, that's correct.\n\nStep 8 result: 9841\n\nStep 9:\n\nStep 9: Compute (1 + 3*(step 8 result))\nSo, (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*9841: Let's break it down.\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*800=2400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nSo, step 9 result: 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, in the original problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 as well. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the step 9 result is the innermost part, and then we have to multiply by 3 each time we go out a layer. Wait, no, actually, each step is the inner part, so after step 9, we have the innermost part computed, and then each step is moving outwards, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But in my initial approach, I was just computing each layer step by step, so step 1 is the innermost, step 2 is the next, and so on until step 9, which is the outermost part before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost part up to step 9, which gives me 29524, that is the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: 3*( ... ), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, after computing all nine layers, the result is that innermost part, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(inner layer). So, when I compute the innermost (1 + 3) as step 1, then the next layer is step 2: 1 + 3*(step 1). Then step 3 is 1 + 3*(step 2), and so on until step 9, which is the outermost inner layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, the final expression is 3*(step 9 result). So, after computing step 9 as 29524, then the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my previous steps, I thought step 9 was the outermost inner layer, so the entire expression is 3*(step 9). So, step 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is the final answer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to step 9 as 29524, but I didn't multiply by 3 again. So, maybe I missed that step.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is step 1: 4.\n\nThen, step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(step 9 result), which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, yes, I think I missed that last multiplication. So, step 9 gives me 29524, and then I have to multiply that by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nSo, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStep 1: 1+3=4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each step, just to verify.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier for step 9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut in this case, since it's nested, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4.\n- Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n- After 9 layers, the innermost part is 29524.\n- The entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each step again quickly:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write a small program or use a calculator to compute each step, I could automate this process, but since it's only nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. However, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost part, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested set of terms, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like there's a repeating pattern here. Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(result from above). Let me compute that next.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me check again. If the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) which is indeed 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that seems right.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(result). Let me compute that.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That looks correct.\n\nContinuing this way, each time I'm moving one layer out and computing the next expression. Let me try to list each step clearly.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Okay, moving on.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's correct.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems correct.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That looks right.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, hold on, no. Let me check again. The expression is 3 multiplied by (the result of the inner expression). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression, which after step 9 is 29524. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify each step again because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Outermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. But let me double-check one or two steps to be sure.\n\nLet me recompute step 6: 1 + 3*364.\n\n364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can represent this expression as a recursive formula or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I define each layer as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, it's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) => layer 1\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, I think.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)), so how many times does 3(1 + 3(...) occur?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The first layer is 3*(1 + 3)\n- Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous))\n- So, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(1 + ...)\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we add another 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each ( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1 + 3(...) occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it, another 3, and so on, until the innermost 3. So, the number of 3(1 + 3(...) is 9 times. Because the innermost is just (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each time you go out, it's another layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier counting, when I computed step by step, I had 10 layers: from a_1 to a_10. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIn the expression, the number of 3(1 + 3(...) is 9, but each of those corresponds to a layer. So, the innermost is the first layer, then each subsequent 3(1 + 3(...) adds another layer.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nIf I have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can nest the expression.\n\nIn this case, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time you add another 3(1 + ...) outside, that's another layer.\n\nLooking at the original expression, how many 3(1 + 3(...) are there? Let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n\n2. Then, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is the second layer.\n\n3. Continuing this way, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is another layer.\n\nCounting the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) in the original expression:\n\n- The first 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is the outermost, then each subsequent one is inside.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, the first ( is at position 2: 3(...\n\n2. Then inside that, another ( at position 5: 3(1 + 3(...\n\n3. Continuing this way, each ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that suggests there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step computation, I had 10 steps, from a_1 to a_10, where a_10 was the outermost. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but the number of computations is 10 because we start from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, in the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation of a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, where n is the number of layers, then a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our case, the outermost operation is 3 times a_n, where n=9.\n\nSo, total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me try computing it another way.\n\nSuppose I represent the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, and so on, until E9, and then E = 3*E9.\n\nBut this is similar to what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer contributes a term that is 3^k, where k is the number of layers from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me think about it.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nWait, actually, when I solved the recurrence earlier, I found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then E = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach time, we're adding 3^k, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step, writing out each term.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nE = 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 using another method, like multiplying each digit:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each step and using different methods to compute, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4.

    "text": " Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nHmm, so it's a nested expression with multiple layers. Each layer seems to be of the form 3*(1 + something). Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works for nested expressions, right? So, let's identify where the innermost part is.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me count the number of times 3 is being multiplied. Let me see: starting from the end, each time it's 3*(1 + ...). So, there are nine sets of parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3s. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then multiplied by 3, then that result is inside another (1 + ...), multiplied by 3, and so on, until the outermost 3 is applied. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier if I write each layer as a separate step. Let me define each layer as a variable or something. Let me denote the innermost part as A, then the next layer as B, and so on until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nA = 1 + 3\n\nThen, the next layer is:\n\nB = 1 + 3*A\n\nThen, C = 1 + 3*B\n\nAnd so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...)) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, there's one (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and moving outward, how many layers are there? Let me see: the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1). Then layer3: 3*(1 + layer2). Wait, actually, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer1: (1+3) = 4. Then layer2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5=15. Then layer3: 3*(1 + layer2)=3*(1+15)=3*16=48. Wait, but hold on, the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, right? So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer1 to Layer9. So, the outermost layer is Layer9, which is 3*(1 + Layer8). So, the final result is Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1: 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have 3*(1 + previous layer). So, Layer2: 3*(1 + 4)=15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 +15)=48\n\nLayer4:3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer5:3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer6:3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer7:3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer8:3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer9:3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, each (1+3(...)) adds another layer. Let's see: starting from the first 3, the number of (1+3(...)) is nine. Because each time it's 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is (1+3). So, total layers are nine, so Layer1 to Layer9, as I did above. So, yes, Layer9 is the outermost, giving 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me see: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nA = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2\n\nBut let me check if this works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = 11/2 - 3/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = 99/6 - 3/2 = 33/2 - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct, as above.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\n19683 /6 = 3280.5\n\n3280.5 *11 = Let's compute:\n\n3280 *11 = 36,080\n\n0.5*11=5.5\n\nTotal: 36,080 +5.5=36,085.5\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the formula. Let me recompute a_n for n=9.\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\n(11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\n3^9 is 19,683.\n\nSo,\n\n11/6 * 19,683 = ?\n\nFirst, 19,683 divided by 6 is 3,280.5\n\nThen, 3,280.5 multiplied by 11:\n\n3,280 *11 = 36,080\n\n0.5*11=5.5\n\nSo, total is 36,080 +5.5=36,085.5\n\nThen subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 -1.5=36,084\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2\n\n= (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\n(11*19,683 -9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19,683:\n\n19,683 *10=196,830\n\n19,683 *1=19,683\n\nTotal:196,830 +19,683=216,513\n\nThen subtract 9:216,513 -9=216,504\n\nDivide by 6:216,504 /6=36,084\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again, to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer1:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:3*(1+4)=3*5=15\n\nLayer3:3*(1+15)=3*16=48\n\nLayer4:3*(1+48)=3*49=147\n\nLayer5:3*(1+147)=3*148=444\n\nLayer6:3*(1+444)=3*445=1,335\n\nLayer7:3*(1+1,335)=3*1,336=4,008\n\nLayer8:3*(1+4,008)=3*4,009=12,027\n\nLayer9:3*(1+12,027)=3*12,028=36,084\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it as a geometric series.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation as I did before, since it's straightforward and I've already verified it multiple times.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute it again from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer3:3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer4:3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer5:3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer6:3*(1+444)=1,335\n\nLayer7:3*(1+1,335)=4,008\n\nLayer8:3*(1+4,008)=12,027\n\nLayer9:3*(1+12,027)=36,084\n\nYes, same result each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula a_n = (11*3^n -9)/6.\n\nFor n=9:\n\n(11*3^9 -9)/6 = (11*19,683 -9)/6 = (216,513 -9)/6=216,504/6=36,084\n\nYes, same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each step outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

Next: 1 + 3*(previous result)\n4. Continue this until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, and each closing parenthesis reduces it. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). The innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 is used before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then 1+3(, then 1+3(, and so on, until the innermost 1+3). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3), so the 9th layer is 1+3, and then each layer wraps around it. So, actually, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. Let me confirm:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer 1), which is layer 2. Then layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on until layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, total layers inside the initial 3 are 9. Therefore, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, L7=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Thus, L8=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Thus, L9=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 29524*3.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the number of layers to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears before the first closing parenthesis. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3(...\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider that each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first \"1 + 3\" is at the end, then each previous layer wraps around it with another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3(...\n\nSo, the first layer is 1 + 3), then each previous layer adds another 1 + 3(.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nYes, so 9 layers in total. So, my previous calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the count again. Let's write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nYes, so 9 layers. So, my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula for the nth term.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1)) * k^{n-1} - (c)/(k - 1).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is:\n\na_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*( (k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1) )\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*k^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = k*B + c => B - k*B = c => B*(1 - k) = c => B = c/(1 - k).\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*k^n + c/(1 - k).\n\nGiven the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can find A.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*k^1 + c/(1 - k) = A*k + c/(1 - k) = 4.\n\nGiven k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, a_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also gave me the same result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3 multiplied by each other. By breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost part outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation formula, the solution is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst off, I notice that it's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part, it seems like each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, and then that result is used in the next outer layer. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3(...) parts, I think there are nine layers. Let me check:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3(...))\n3. Repeating until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nHmm, each time after the 3(, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. The innermost is the last 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is the first step\n3. Each time, moving outward, adding another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, perhaps there are nine layers of (1 + 3(...)) starting from the innermost. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3(.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost part first.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then each step adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, after the first 3(, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then each step adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3(.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 3(1+3(...) in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"3(\" before hitting the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is (1 + 3), so perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me see:\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time after the initial 3*, there's a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3* is applied. From the expression, I can see that after the initial 3*(, there are 8 more 3*(...). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each \"1 + 3(\" corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3), then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9 being 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers or 8 layers. Because sometimes when you start counting from 1, the total number might be one less. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go outward, we add a layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, from the innermost (1 + 3) up to the outermost 3*(...), how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer, except the innermost which is just (1+3). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9.\n\nYes, so Layer 9 is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be represented using a formula if the number of layers is known. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me verify with another approach. Maybe using iteration or another formula.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, L_4 = 121, L_5 = 364, L_6 = 1093, L_7 = 3280, L_8 = 9841, L_9 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively 3^{n} + something. But I think the formula we derived earlier is correct.\n\nSo, I think I've double-checked enough. The final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up using multiple nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNext layer out, it's $1 + 3(13)$. Let's calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So now, that layer becomes 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the result from the inner layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward.\n\nLet me keep going. The next layer is $1 + 3(40)$. Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that becomes 121. Moving outward again, the next expression is $1 + 3(121)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That layer simplifies to 364.\n\nContinuing outward, the next one is $1 + 3(364)$. Let me do that: 3 times 364. Hmm, 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 64 is 192, so adding those together gives 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that layer becomes 1093.\n\nNext up, the expression is $1 + 3(1093)$. Let me calculate that. 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 93 is 279, so adding those gives 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 is 3280. So, that layer simplifies to 3280.\n\nMoving outward again, it's $1 + 3(3280)$. Let's compute that: 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 280 is 840, so adding those gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that layer becomes 9841.\n\nNext, the expression is $1 + 3(9841)$. Calculating that: 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 841 is 2523, so adding those together gives 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 is 29524. So, that layer simplifies to 29524.\n\nContinuing outward, the next one is $1 + 3(29524)$. Let me work that out: 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9524. Wait, maybe it's better to compute 29524 times 3 directly. Let's see, 29524 times 3: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 24 times 3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that layer becomes 88573.\n\nNext layer out is $1 + 3(88573)$. Let me compute that. 88573 times 3: 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. So, that layer becomes 265720.\n\nNow, moving outward to the next layer, it's $1 + 3(265720)$. Let me calculate that. 265720 times 3: 200000 times 3 is 600000, 60000 times 3 is 180000, 5000 times 3 is 15000, 700 times 3 is 2100, 20 times 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161. So, that layer simplifies to 797161.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is $3(797161)$. Let me compute that: 797161 times 3. Let's break it down: 700000 times 3 is 2100000, 90000 times 3 is 270000, 7000 times 3 is 21000, 100 times 3 is 300, 60 times 3 is 180, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, the final result is 2391483.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so I want to ensure that each layer was correctly computed.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. $1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13$\n3. $1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40$\n4. $1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121$\n5. $1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364$\n6. $1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n7. $1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n8. $1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n9. $1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n10. $1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573$\n11. $1 + 3(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720$\n12. $1 + 3(265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161$\n13. $3(797161) = 2391483$\n\nEach step seems correct. I added 1 after each multiplication by 3, and each multiplication was done correctly. So, I think the final answer is indeed 2,391,483.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression seems to be a repeated application of the function f(x) = 3x + 1, starting from 1 and doing it multiple times. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nLet's consider the general case where we have n layers. Let's denote the value after k layers as a_k. Then, we have the recurrence relation:\n\na_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1\n\nwith a_0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a constant C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_0 = 1:\n\n1 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = A - 1/2 => A = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k layers, the value is (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3s inside: each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of times we have a 1 + 3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to the outermost one.\n\nWait, actually, the expression has 9 layers. Let me count:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3(...)\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...), and we have 9 such layers before the outermost 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Each time, the number of 3s inside increases by one. So, from the innermost, there's 1 three, then 2 threes, up to 9 threes? Wait, no, actually, the number of layers is 9, because each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we apply the function f(x) = 3x + 1. Each layer corresponds to one application. So, starting from x0 = 1, then x1 = 3x0 + 1, x2 = 3x1 + 1, and so on, up to x9.\n\nWait, let's check: the innermost is x1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then x2 = 1 + 3x1 = 13, x3 = 1 + 3x2 = 40, and so on, up to x9. Then, the outermost expression is 3x9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost is 3 times the result of the inner expression, which is x9. So, the total expression is 3x9.\n\nGiven that, using the formula we derived earlier, x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, x9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3x9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Wait, but that doesn't match our earlier result of 2391483.\n\nWait, that suggests that my formula might be off. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the formula, x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, x9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so x9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*x9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 2391483 as the final result. That's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. Maybe I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the initial 3 corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...)), then each subsequent (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a (1+3(...)) inside another one, and there are 9 such layers before the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, x9 = 29524, and then 3*x9 = 88572. But when I computed step by step, I got 2391483.\n\nWait, that suggests that I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving out, 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time, we have another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Therefore, the number of layers is 9.\n\nBut according to the formula, x9 = 29524, and 3*x9 = 88572. But when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2,391,483. So, there must be a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back to my step-by-step computation. Maybe I miscounted the layers or made an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me list out each step again, clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. Finally: 3*797161 = 2391483\n\nWait, so according to this, there are 13 layers. But when I counted the opening parentheses, I thought there were 9. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sequences:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", starting from the innermost. So, in my step-by-step, I went up to 13 layers because I included the outermost 3 as an additional layer. Wait, no, in the formula, x_k is the value after k layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost is 3*x_k.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost 3 is considered a layer or not. In the formula, x_k represents the value after k layers of 1 + 3(...), so the total expression is 3*x_k.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), then x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I ended up with 2391483, which is much larger. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions in the original problem.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, according to the formula, x_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*x_9 = 88572.\n\nBut when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2391483, which is much larger. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers in my step-by-step.\n\nWait, in my step-by-step, I had 13 layers, but according to the original expression, there are only 9 layers. So, perhaps I included the outermost 3 as a layer, but in the formula, the outermost 3 is separate from the layers of 1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn the formula, x_k is the value after k layers of 1 + 3(...). So, for k=9, x_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*x_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went from 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1), up to 3*(result) = 2391483. So, that's 13 layers, including the outermost 3. But in the formula, the outermost 3 is applied after k layers, so the total number of operations is k layers plus 1 multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so it's one multiplication by 3 after k layers.\n\nTherefore, in my step-by-step, I must have included the outermost 3 as part of the layers, leading to k=12 or something. Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer 9)\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 (layer 10)\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720 (layer 11)\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 797161 (layer 12)\n13. 3*797161 = 2391483 (layer 13)\n\nWait, so in my step-by-step, I have 13 layers, but according to the original expression, there are only 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. Let me look again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, in my step-by-step, I must have gone beyond 9 layers, leading to a different result.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is correct, and my step-by-step was wrong because I continued too far.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the inner part has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, according to the formula, the value inside the outermost 3 is x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went up to 13 layers, which suggests that I included more layers than actually present in the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), but in my step-by-step, I included the outermost 3 as a layer, leading to k=12 or something.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the formula x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2 is for k layers of 1 + 3(...). So, if there are 9 layers, x_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*x_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went beyond 9 layers, up to 13 layers, which is incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, I must have miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. Let me recount carefully.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, in my step-by-step, I should have stopped at layer 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, correcting my step-by-step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer 9)\n10. Then, the outermost expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 88572, not 2,391,483. So, my earlier step-by-step was incorrect because I continued beyond the actual number of layers in the original expression.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by recalculating step-by-step up to 9 layers and then multiplying by 3.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (layer 9)\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the formula. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI must have miscounted the number of layers in my initial step-by-step, leading to an incorrect result. It's a good reminder to always double-check the structure of the problem, especially with nested expressions.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the recurrence relation, we can directly compute the result without manually stepping through each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nSo, in summary, the expression simplifies to 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the operation \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous layer})\\). By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the result efficiently. \n\nThe recurrence relation is \\(a_k = 3a_{k-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_0 = 1\\). Solving this, we find that \\(a_k = \\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2}\\). For 9 layers, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each part is similar but nested deeper. Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, I can see that there are nine layers here, each starting with a 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Let me count them to be sure. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3(1+3).\n3. Then 1+3(1+3(1+3)).\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me check that. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: the innermost is just 1+3, then each layer adds another set. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each time, another layer is added. So how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original problem, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another expression). So, it's like a chain of 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) nine times.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3s. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on. Let me count how many 3s are there:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. Then another 3\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds a closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses:\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the end, each layer adds another set. Let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), so that's one layer.\n2. Then moving out, it's (1+3(...)), that's two layers.\n3. Continuing, each time I move out, I add another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see how many times the pattern 3*(1 + ...) repeats. Let me write it as a sequence:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo L1: 1 + 3\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, up to L9: 1 + 3*(L8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(L9)\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9, each one depending on the previous.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 up to L9, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nFirst, 3*29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\nx     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from L1: 1+3=4, correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me assume a particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, L9=29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is using exponents, which might be faster if the number of layers is larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 multiplied by another similar expression. It seems like a recursive structure, where each part depends on the next. Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 multiplied by the result of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, let me see. After the innermost (1 + 3) is computed as 4, the next level is 3(1 + 3(...)). Hmm, maybe I should work step by step, computing each layer one by one.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity.\n\nLet's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: Now, moving one level out, we have 3 multiplied by (1 + Level 1). So that's 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. The Level 2 expression is 3*(1 + Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, then yes, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLevel 3: Next, moving out another level, we have 3*(1 + Level 2). So that's 3*(1 + 15).\n\n3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. If Level 2 is 15, then Level 3 is 3*(1 + 15) which is indeed 3*16 = 48. Okay, moving on.\n\nLevel 4: Now, 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48).\n\n3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: Next, 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147).\n\n3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: Then, 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444).\n\n3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: Continuing, 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335).\n\n3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: Next, 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008).\n\n3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: Finally, 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027).\n\n3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot, but let me verify each step because I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 after adding 1. So, starting from 4, each level is 3*(1 + previous result). So, each step is tripling the previous result plus 3, right?\n\nWait, let me think about that. If I have 3*(1 + x), that's equal to 3 + 3x, which is 3x + 3. So, each level is 3 times the previous level plus 3. Hmm, that might be a pattern here.\n\nLet me test that idea. Starting from Level 1: 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*4 + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15.

Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 3*1335 + 3 = 4005 + 3 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*4008 + 3 = 12024 + 3 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*12027 + 3 = 36081 + 3 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each level is 3 times the previous level plus 3. That seems to hold true. So, this is a geometric progression or something similar?\n\nWait, but actually, each term is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nHmm, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence relation to compute it without having to go through each level step by step. But since there are only 9 levels, it's manageable manually, but maybe it's good to know the general approach.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 3.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify that: 11/6 * 3^n = (11 * 3^{n}) / 6 = (11 * 3^{n-1}) / 2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11 * 3^{n-1}) / 2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (11*9 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost level, we can compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561: Let's compute 10*6561 = 65610, plus 1*6561 = 6561, so total is 65610 + 6561 = 72171.\n\nThen, subtract 3: 72171 - 3 = 72168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, both methods, the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach, give the same result. That gives me confidence that 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The structure was a bit intimidating at first, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to use a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which could be useful for similar problems in the future.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each level and verifying my work, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation helps in verifying the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

Let me think differently. The expression has 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\", each nested within the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, which is L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent this as a recursive formula.

So, 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a_9. Let me go back through each a_n step by step.\n\na_1 = 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2=1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3=1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4=1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5=1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6=1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7=1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8=1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9=1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all correct.

The problem has nine layers of 1+3(...), right?\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n10.

So, yes, a_9 is the innermost after 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the a_7 computation.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all correct. So, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the multiplication steps.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of nested 1+3(...) parts. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...) until there are nine such layers, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, maybe it's a recursive expression where each step is 1 plus 3 times the previous step. Hmm.\n\nLet me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. I'll label each step as S1, S2, up to S9 for clarity.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yep, that's correct.\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right.\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay.\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nWait, 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1092 +1=1093.

Then, 29523 +1=29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523.

Wait, 29524*3: Let me do it step by step.\n\n29524\n\ntimes 3\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(S9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because that seems like a big number, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me verify S9 again because if S9 is wrong, everything after that will be wrong.\n\nStarting from S1:\n\nS1=1+3=4\n\nS2=1+3*4=13\n\nS3=1+3*13=40\n\nS4=1+3*40=121\n\nS5=1+3*121=364\n\nS6=1+3*364=1093\n\nS7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nS8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nS9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in S9. Let me compute S9 again.\n\nS8=9841\n\nSo S9=1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me do it digit by digit.\n\n9841\n\ntimes 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number. Wait, no, 9841 is 9 thousands, 8 hundreds, 4 tens, and 1 unit.\n\nWait, 9*3=27, but since it's the thousands place, it's 9*3=27, so 27 thousands, which is 27000.\n\n8*3=24 hundreds, which is 2400.\n\n4*3=12 tens, which is 120.\n\n1*3=3 units.\n\nSo 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen S9=1 + 29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is the original expression 3 multiplied by S9, or is it 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...))? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo it's 3*(S9), where S9 is 1 + 3*(S8). So yes, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised by how large the number is. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each step manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each step is of the form S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1=1+3=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1=4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is S_n - 3*S_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is S_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution S_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition S_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, S_1=4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSo 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: S_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: S_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: S_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, S_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression. We compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( S_n \\) where:\n\\[ S_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\\[ S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\nNext layers:\n\\[ S_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\]\n\\[ S_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\]\n\\[ S_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\]\n\\[ S_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\]\n\\[ S_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\]\n\\[ S_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\]\n\\[ S_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\]\n\\[ S_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot S_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot S_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of 1s and 3s. Each part seems to be of the form 1 + 3(...), and each of those is multiplied by 3. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So perhaps each layer is a multiplication by 3 of the result of the inner expression. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's easy. 1 + 3 is 4. So the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, no, looking back, it's 1 + 3*(inner expression). So each time, it's 1 + 3*(result from the inner layer). Let me confirm.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- There's a 0 at the end, so it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carry.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are 9 sets, so 9 layers. So from layer 1 to layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then the outermost 3 multiplies the result of layer 9.\n\nSo yes, each step seems correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, in our case, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, let me define it properly. Let's say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found, but maybe for 9 terms, it's easier to compute each step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me try to find the closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence of the form a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nThus, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3*29524. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to compute 29524*3.\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = let's compute:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly because if any of the layers were miscalculated, the final answer would be wrong.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first layer.\n\nThen each time we have (1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)), so:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1))\n3. (1 + 3*(2))\n...\nWait, actually, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So I think I did it correctly with 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric series or something. But maybe that's overcomplicating it. Since each step is straightforward, maybe it's better to just compute each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the results:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each result is 3 times the previous result plus 1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 2 to Layer 3: 3*13 +1 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 3 to Layer 4: 3*40 +1 = 121. Correct.\n\nYes, so each layer is 3*(previous layer) +1.\n\nSo if I let a_n be the result of the nth layer, then a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it in a more general way.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C =1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify the multiplication again: 3*29524.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer one by one:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 9 layers, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result, plus 1. Wait, no, looking again, the structure is 3*(1 + ...). So actually, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So maybe I should compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and each of these is multiplied by 3 in the next layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So maybe I can represent each layer as a function, say, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_0 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. Each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So yes, each time we compute 1 + 3*(the previous value). So:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because the original expression has 9 layers of parentheses. Let me count again.\n\nWait, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So the number of layers is 9, right? Because each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 3*(1 + ... occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1 + 3), then each step adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9. So, I think I did 9 steps above.\n\nWait, in my previous steps, I went from step 1 to step 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, step 1: 4, step 2:13, step3:40, step4:121, step5:364, step6:1093, step7:3280, step8:9841, step9:29524.\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(that value). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Because in the initial problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire expression inside, which after 9 layers is 29524. So, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that again, because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me represent each layer as a term.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), which is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 *3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3=27000.\n\n500*3=1500.\n\n20*3=60.\n\n4*3=12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with so many layers.\n\nLet me recount the steps:\n\na_1: 1 + 3 =4.\n\na_2:1 +3*4=13.\n\na_3:1 +3*13=40.\n\na_4:1 +3*40=121.\n\na_5:1 +3*121=364.\n\na_6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\na_7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\na_8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\na_9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n to avoid computing each step manually.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\na_1 =4.\n\na_2=13.\n\na_3=40.\n\na_4=121.\n\na_5=364.\n\na_6=1093.\n\na_7=3280.\n\na_8=9841.\n\na_9=29524.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 =4.\n\nSo, when n=1: A*3^1 + B =4 => 3A + B=4.\n\nNow, let's compute a few more terms to see if we can find a pattern.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to use the method for solving linear recurrences.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n =3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous part: a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K =3*K +1.\n\nSolving for K: K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's take n=1: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C =4 +1/2 =9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nThus, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThus, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify the multiplication again: 29524*3.\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Yes, correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, since a_9=29524, then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), which is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous result. After computing each layer step by step, the innermost value is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After 9 layers, the innermost value is 29524.\n4. Multiply this value by 3 to get the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have $1 + 3(\\text{previous result})$. Wait, let me check the structure again. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, and then multiplied by 3. Hmm, actually, looking back at the problem, each layer is 3 times (1 plus 3 times the next layer). So, maybe I should represent each step as a function of the next step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define $a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have $a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is multiplied by 3, so actually, maybe each step is 3*(1 + 3*next step). Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the original expression: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner)). So perhaps I should define each term as $a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})$.\n\nBut let's count how many layers there are. The expression starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and there are nine sets of parentheses, so maybe nine layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3( inside that, so that's two.\n3. Continuing, I see that there are nine 3's after the initial 3, each inside their own parentheses. Wait, actually, the initial expression is 3 followed by 9 layers of 3*(1+...). Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each inner part is another 3*(1+...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, if I count the number of times 3 is multiplied, it's 9 times. So, perhaps there are 9 layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3))\n\nSo yes, 9 layers. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... + 3))).\n\nSo, perhaps I can define each layer starting from the innermost as a1, then a2, up to a9, where each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, but actually, no, because each layer is multiplied by 3, not just added.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the recursion is a bit different.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote that each layer is of the form 3*(1 + next_layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is just 1 + 3, then moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous_layer).\n\nWait, let me think again. The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because the next layer would actually be 3*(1 + previous_layer). Wait, perhaps I should define it as starting from the innermost and building up.\n\nLet me try to structure this step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing down each layer, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, so does that mean that the total expression is Layer9? So, the value would be 36084?\n\nWait, but let me check that again. When I defined Layer1 as 1+3=4, then Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*5=15, Layer3=3*(1+15)=48, etc., up to Layer9=36084. So, the entire expression is Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut let me verify this by computing each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step, I'm taking the previous layer, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and so on. So, after nine layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let's count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3))))) So, each closing parenthesis represents a layer. Let's count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3))\n\nSo, nine opening parentheses, meaning nine layers. So, the total number of layers is nine, which matches the nine steps I took earlier, ending up with 36084.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 36084.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it that way to confirm.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3K => K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2.\n\nBut let's test this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0}) - 3/2 = 11 - 1.5 = 9.5, which is not equal to 4. Hmm, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake in the particular solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the particular solution isn't a constant. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is correct: a_h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can try a particular solution of the form a_p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3K => K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333.\n\nThus, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\na_3 = (11/6)*3^3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct.\n\na_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 1.5 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 / 6 = 3280.5.\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5 from 36085.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 36084.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by using a closed-form solution from the recurrence relation. Both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 3*(1 + ...).

    "text": " Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, where each part is similar but nested inside each other. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions because the innermost one doesn't depend on anything else.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is 3 times that result. So the next layer is 3*(innermost result). Let me compute that:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Hmm, maybe I was too quick there. Let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + the next layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) because it's 3*(1 + innermost). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen the next layer out is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So that would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, that seems different from what I thought before. Let me confirm.\n\nSo the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nSo each time, you have 3*(1 + something), where \"something\" is the next layer.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right either. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but the problem is that each time you have 3*(1 + ...), so maybe I'm mixing up the order.\n\nLet me try to write down each layer step by step.\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So let me list each layer:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nWait, but let me check: the problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nThen next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nWait, but wait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Wait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count how many 3s there are.\n\nLooking at it: starting with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo each time, it's 3(...) with a new 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each time, a new 3 is inside. So the number of layers is 9, because each 3(...) is a new layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the outermost 3, each inner 3 is a new layer. Let me count how many times 3(1 + 3( ... )) occurs.\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s after the initial one. Each 3 starts a new layer. So:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers? Because the innermost is 1 + 3, then 8 more layers? Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time you have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me think about it as a chain of 9 layers. So starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is Layer9, which is 36084. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from Layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let me compute 1336*3: 1336*3 is 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let me compute 12028*3:\n\n12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000 + 84 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo the final result is 36084. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but given the time, I think computing each layer is manageable since there are only 9 layers.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So each layer can be represented as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, so that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 15\n\na_3 = 48\n\na_4 = 147\n\na_5 = 444\n\na_6 = 1335\n\na_7 = 4008\n\na_8 = 12027\n\na_9 = 36084\n\nLooking at the ratios between consecutive terms:\n\n15/4 = 3.75\n\n48/15 = 3.2\n\n147/48 \u2248 3.0625\n\n444/147 \u2248 3.0136\n\n1335/444 \u2248 3.00677\n\n4008/1335 \u2248 3.00225\n\n12027/4008 \u2248 3.00075\n\n36084/12027 \u2248 3.00025\n\nHmm, so each term is approaching 3 times the previous term, but it's a bit more than 3 each time. So it's like a geometric sequence with ratio approaching 3 as the number of terms increases.\n\nBut perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2.\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nSo a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*9 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11*243 - 3)/2 = (2673 - 3)/2 = 2670/2 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11*729 - 3)/2 = (8019 - 3)/2 = 8016/2 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11*2187 - 3)/2 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then I noticed a pattern and tried to find a general formula, which worked out. So the answer should be 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression, meaning each part inside the parentheses is itself another expression. So, starting from the innermost part might be the best approach. Let me write it out in parts to visualize it better.\n\nLet me denote each level of nesting as a separate expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. Let\u2019s call the innermost part E1: 1+3\n2. Then moving out, E2: 1 + 3*(E1)\n3. Next, E3: 1 + 3*(E2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost expression.\n\nSo, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level, and the closing ones balance them. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are 9 levels of nesting. That means I need to compute from E1 up to E9, and then multiply the outermost 3 by E9.\n\nWait, actually, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from E1, which is 1 + 3, then E2 is 1 + 3*E1, E3 is 1 + 3*E2, and so on until E9. Then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, to avoid confusion, let me list each E step by step.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check these calculations because they seem to be growing very quickly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. Let's break it down:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nSo, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by E9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check each step again quickly.\n\nE1: 1+3=4\n\nE2:1+3*4=13\n\nE3:1+3*13=40\n\nE4:1+3*40=121\n\nE5:1+3*121=364\n\nE6:1+3*364=1093\n\nE7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nE8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nE9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently to confirm the result. Perhaps by recognizing a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me think. Each E_n is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, which in this case is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E_n = (E_1 - c) * r^{n-1} + c, where r is the common ratio and c is the constant term.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences. For a recurrence relation of the form E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, the solution is:\n\nE_n = a^{n-1} * E_1 + b * (a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nIn this case, a=3, b=1, E1=4.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nE_n = 3^{n-1} * 4 + 1 * (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nCombine terms:\n\nE_n = (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nE_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, 4*3^{n-1} is equal to (8/2)*3^{n-1}, so when we add (3^{n-1} -1)/2, it becomes (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} -1)/2 = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, E_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nSimplify 9*3^{n-1}: 9 is 3^2, so 3^{2} * 3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for the first few terms, which is a good sign.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression with multiple levels of parentheses. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Each level is computed using the formula \\( E_n = 1 + 3 \\times E_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( E_1 = 4 \\). \n\nUsing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each level \\( E_n \\) can be expressed as \\( E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the 9th level, this gives us \\( E_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 multiplied by another similar expression. It seems recursive, so maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So, substituting the innermost result, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(next level). So, starting from the innermost, each step depends on the next one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of nested expressions. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ).\n\nSo, each time, we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times this happens.\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's 9 layers deep? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), and each time, the next layer is another 1 + 3(...).

Let me count how many times 3( occurs.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then the next is 3( inside, so that's the second, and so on. Wait, perhaps it's 9 times, but maybe 8? Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to see that each 3( is followed by a 1 + 3(...), and each time, the innermost is (1 + 3). So, perhaps there are 8 layers, because each 3( introduces a new layer. Let me try to compute step by step.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach it as a recursive expression, where each layer is defined as a function of the next. So, let me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let's define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9).

Correct.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Level9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3.\n\nCompute 9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29,523. So, Level9=1 +29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29,524*3 again.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572.

Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is level1.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(level1) is level2.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(level2) is level3.\n\nContinuing until we have 9 levels? Wait, no, perhaps it's 8 levels because the initial expression is 3*(...), so the innermost is level1, then level2 up to level9. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to level9, which was 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each opening parenthesis after that adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nAfter the first 3(, we have 1+3(...), which has another 3( inside. So, each time we have a 3(, that's a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 Level1: 1 +3(...)\n2. Inside that, 3(1 +3(...)) \u2192 Level2:1 +3(...)\n3. And so on, until we reach the innermost (1 +3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), so let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each next layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), that's layer1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: ))))))))).\n\nWait, that's 8 closing parentheses. So, perhaps there are 8 layers inside the initial 3(.\n\nWait, so maybe my earlier count was wrong because I thought there were 9 layers, but actually, there are 8 layers inside the initial 3(.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 +3), that's layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3( introduces a new layer.\n\nWait, so perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of 3( after the initial one.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\n- The first 3( is at the very beginning.\n\n- Then, inside that, we have 1 +3(...), which is 3(1 +3(...)).\n\nSo, that's the second layer.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each 1+3(...) is a new layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to level9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me check how many times I added a new layer.\n\nWait, let me think: starting from (1 +3), that's level1.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(level1) is level2.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(level2) is level3.\n\nContinuing up to level9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, how many 1+3(...) are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, it's:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), so how many times does 1+3(...) occur?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 +3)\n2. Then, one level out: 1 +3*(...)\n3. Then, next level: 1 +3*(...)\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 1+3(...) is 9, including the innermost.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 because the initial expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3(, each 1+3( introduces a new layer.\n\nSo, the first layer inside is 1 +3(...), which is layer1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 +3(...), which is layer2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3), which would be layer8.\n\nWait, because after the initial 3(, there are 8 more 3( inside.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3( after the initial one.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nAfter the initial 3(, the next is 3(, then another 3(, and so on.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. After the initial 3(, the first 3( is at position 2: 3(1+3(...\n\nThen, inside that, another 3(, so that's 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is the 8th 3(.\n\nSo, there are 8 layers inside the initial 3(, making the total layers 9 including the initial one.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to level9, which would correspond to 8 layers inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as follows:\n\nEach time we have a 3(1 +3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 +3), which is layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3(1 +3(...)) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the innermost is layer1: (1 +3) =4.\n\nThen, layer2: 1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(13)=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(40)=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(121)=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(364)=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(1093)=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(3280)=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(9841)=29524.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, with layer9 being the outermost inside the initial 3(.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the expression has 9 layers or 8.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 +3), which is layer1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 +3( in the expression.\n\nLet me count the number of 1 +3( in the expression.\n\nLooking at it:\n\n- The first 1 +3( is inside the initial 3(.\n\nThen, each subsequent 1 +3( is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 +3( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. (1 +3) \u2192 layer1.\n\n2. 1 +3(1 +3(...)) \u2192 layer2.\n\n3. 1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(...))) \u2192 layer3.\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, how many times does 1 +3( occur?\n\nLet me parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 +3), which is layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3( introduces a new layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, the first 1 +3( is layer2.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 +3( is layer3.\n\nContinuing until we reach the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each 3( adds a new layer, and the expression ends with eight closing parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) )\n\nSo, the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3( is eight, meaning that there are eight layers inside.\n\nWait, but then, if I have eight layers inside, that would mean layer1 to layer8.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering layer9.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nIf the initial 3( is layer0, then inside it is layer1, and so on, up to layer8.\n\nSo, the innermost is layer8, which is (1 +3)=4.\n\nThen, layer7:1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(13)=40.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(40)=121.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(121)=364.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(364)=1093.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*(1093)=3280.\n\nLayer1:1 +3*(3280)=9841.\n\nWait, but then the initial expression is 3*(layer1)=3*9841=29,523.\n\nWait, that can't be, because when I computed up to layer9, I got 88,572, but if I only have 8 layers inside, then the total would be 3*9841=29,523.\n\nWait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how I'm numbering the layers.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost expression and work my way out, computing each step.\n\nSo, innermost expression:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext:\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so E9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, how many layers are there? From E1 to E9, that's 9 layers.\n\nBut when I look at the original expression, how many 1 +3(...) are there?\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 +3), which is E1.\n\nThen, each time, we have a 1 +3*(E_previous).\n\nSo, each 3( introduces a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3( after the initial one.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3( in the expression.\n\n- The first 3( is at the beginning.\n\nThen, inside that, we have 3(, then another 3(, and so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many 3( are there after the initial one?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) )\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, the next is 3(, then another 3(, and so on, until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of 3( after the initial one:\n\n1. 3( after the initial 3( \u2192 layer2.\n\n2. 3( inside that \u2192 layer3.\n\n3. 3( \u2192 layer4.\n\n4. 3( \u2192 layer5.\n\n5. 3( \u2192 layer6.\n\n6. 3( \u2192 layer7.\n\n7. 3( \u2192 layer8.\n\n8. 3( \u2192 layer9.\n\nWait, that's 8 3( after the initial one, so 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, E9 is the outermost expression inside the initial 3(, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, E9=29524, so 3*E9=88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought there were 8 layers inside, I got 29,523, which is 3*9841. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is because the initial 3( is layer0, and then the innermost is layer8, making 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but in my computation, I went up to E9=29524, which would be the outermost expression inside the initial 3(, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me compute each Ei step by step:\n\nE1 = 1 +3 =4\n\nE2 =1 +3*4=13\n\nE3=1 +3*13=40\n\nE4=1 +3*40=121\n\nE5=1 +3*121=364\n\nE6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, E9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial expression again to make sure I'm not missing a layer.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 +3), which is E1=4.\n\nThen, each time, moving out, we have 1 +3*(previous Ei).\n\nSo, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524.\n\nSo, 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nWait, each layer is defined as Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Ei = a*3^i + b, where a and b are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1), with E1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is Ei^h = C*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume Ei^p = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2A\n\n=> A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ei = C*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1=4:\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3C =4 + 1/2 =9/2\n\nThus, C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ei= (3/2)*3^i -1/2= (3^{i+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Ei=(3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for i=1: E1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nFor i=2: E2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nSimilarly, E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, Ei=(3^{i+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, E9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I cross-verified using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, and both methods led me to the same result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way out.

It seems like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, counting the number of parentheses might help. Let me see: starting from the outermost, each time I go in, there's another set of parentheses. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the left, each 3(1+... is a layer.

Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking closely, the innermost part is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Then: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the original expression has 9 layers of 3(...). Let me check: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), and inside that, there's another 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), and this continues until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3).

So, how many times does \"3(\" appear?\n\nLet me count:\n\n- The first 3 is at the very beginning: 3(1 + 3(\n- Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(\n- So, each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" inside the expression. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n- Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n- So, each time we add another layer, we add another multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer. Then, each layer outside adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of 3(...). Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and this continues until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\nWait, that's 10 layers. Wait, but when I look at the expression, it's 3(...), and inside that, 3(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many 3s are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a chain of 3s multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me try to count the number of 3s:\n\n- The first 3 is at the beginning: 3(\n- Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(\n- So, each layer adds another 3. So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the expression ends with (1 + 3), which is the innermost. So, starting from the outermost 3, each time we go in, we add another 3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of 3s before each (1 + ...:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside the entire expression.\n2. Then, inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. Then, another 3*(1 + ...)\n4. This continues until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. Inside that, 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s in the expression. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n- The first 3 is at the very beginning.\n- Then, inside that, another 3 after the first 1 +.\n- Then, another 3 after that.\n- This continues until the innermost part.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there in total? Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(\n3. Then, another 3(\n4. Another 3(\n5. Another 3(\n6. Another 3(\n7. Another 3(\n8. Another 3(\n9. Another 3(\n10. Another 3(\n11. Another 3(\n12. Another 3(\n13. Another 3(\n14. Another 3(\n15. Another 3(\nWait, that seems too high. Maybe I'm overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"3(\" appears in the expression. Let me count that:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then, inside that, 3(\n3. Then, another 3(\n4. Another 3(\n5. Another 3(\n6. Another 3(\n7. Another 3(\n8. Another 3(\n9. Another 3(\n10. Another 3(\n11. Another 3(\n12. Another 3(\n13. Another 3(\n14. Another 3(\n15. Another 3(\n16. Another 3(\nWait, that can't be right because the expression isn't that long. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is at the beginning: 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(\n3. Then, another 3(1 + 3(\n4. Continuing this way, each time we have a 3(1 + 3(...).\n\nWait, but how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost part is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer has a closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a nested structure. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That should make it easier.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nCompute (1 + 3): that's 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3). But wait, inside that, it's 3*(1 + 3*(innermost result)).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost result)).\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nThen, L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misapplying the layers. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*(4) = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, the next layer is 3*(1 + innermost result). So, if innermost is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, but in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nWait, let me clarify with the structure.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define L1 as the innermost part: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, L3 is 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen, L4 is 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nWait, but this seems like each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from L1=4, then L2=15, L3=48, L4=147, etc.\n\nBut wait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 layers of 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s before each (1 + ...:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), and each of those has another 3*(1 + ...), until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer, and there are 9 such layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s before each (1 + ...:\n\n1. The first 3 is at the very beginning: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. Continuing this way, until the innermost part.\n\nSo, how many times does \"3*(1 + 3*(...)\" appear? Let me count the number of 3s:\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each starting with 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3). Then, each layer outside adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, to compute this, I can start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I end up with Layer9 being 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's correct. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, after computing each layer, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of 3s in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and this continues until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many 3s are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s before each (1 + ...:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each starting with 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, computing up to Layer9 gives us the final result.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nStarting from a_1 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that confirms the previous computation. So, the final result is indeed 36084.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nWait, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4, which is positive, so perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable here because the particular solution is negative, while our layers are positive and increasing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me check.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's use n=1: a_1 = 4\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\n11/2 = 3C\n\nC = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 3/2:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11/6)*3^n - (9/6) = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me check this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^2 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^3 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48, which matches.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147, correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444, correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335, correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008, correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027, correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084, correct.\n\nYes, so using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same result, 36084, for n=9.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and substitute it into the next until reaching the outermost layer. Using a systematic approach, each layer's result is calculated, leading to the final value of 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Let me see if I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of terms, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a chain of operations, each dependent on the one before it. Since there are multiple layers, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So starting from there:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then multiply by 3 and add 1 again, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So each step involves computing the inner expression first, then substituting back into the outer one.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3*(result1)\n3. 1+3*(result2)\n4. 1+3*(result3)\n5. 1+3*(result4)\n6. 1+3*(result5)\n7. 1+3*(result6)\n8. 1+3*(result7)\n9. 1+3*(result8)\n10. Finally, multiply the entire result by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me make sure I count correctly.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(next innermost). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Let me see:\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a 1+3(...) term. So from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Then the outermost is multiplied by 3. So total layers: 9 innermost terms, each multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and then the whole thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should index them for clarity. Let's label each innermost expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost (1+3), and E9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen the final result is 3*E9.\n\nSo I can compute E1 through E9 step by step.\n\nLet me start computing each E:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the final result is 3*E9 = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nWait, actually, let me write it properly:\n\n29524 is:\n\n2 * 10,000\n\n9 * 1,000\n\n5 * 100\n\n2 * 10\n\n4 * 1\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7\n\n0 + 5 =5\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8\n\nSo 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3*E9 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a pattern or formula for such expressions because computing each step manually is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E_n = a^n * E0 + (b*(a^n -1))/(a -1), where E0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, but in our case, E1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index it differently. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, if we consider E1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 40\n\nSo the recurrence is E_{k} = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is E_k = C*3^k + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence equation.\n\nThe recurrence is E_k - 3*E_{k-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is E_k^h = C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume E_k^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nWhen k=1, E1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor k=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor k=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, E_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have E9, since we have 9 layers.\n\nThus, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute E9 directly without having to compute each step. That's much more efficient, especially if there are more layers.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each step manually and verify with the formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute the result efficiently. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nAlright, the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again, but maybe number each parenthesis to keep track:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + result from the previous step).\n\nWait, actually, looking at it, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, that's nine layers deep. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. Starting from the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3*(...)), so I think there are 9 such layers. So I need to compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, so let's define each layer from the inside out.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 3*(L1) = 3*4 = 12, then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So that's L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(L2) = 3*13 = 39, then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. That's L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, but actually, each time, the structure is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

That's straightforward.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without having to go through each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, maybe it's manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D. Suppose a_n = D for all n. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, which also gives 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step, using the recurrence, or finding a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the multiple methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L2 = 1 + 3 \\times L1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L3 = 1 + 3 \\times L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L4 = 1 + 3 \\times L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L5 = 1 + 3 \\times L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L6 = 1 + 3 \\times L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L7 = 1 + 3 \\times L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L8 = 1 + 3 \\times L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L9 = 1 + 3 \\times L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the entire expression is:\n\\[\n3 \\times L9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of additions and multiplications by 3. It seems like each part is of the form 1 + 3*(something). Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3*(result from above). So, the next layer is (1 + 3*(4)). Let's compute that.\n\n2. Compute 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another level, we have another (1 + 3*(previous result)). Let me do that.\n\n3. Compute 3*13 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so now we have 40. Let's go one more layer out.\n\n4. Compute 3*40 = 120. Then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait a second, 121? That's a perfect square, 11^2. Interesting, but let's keep going.\n\n5. Compute 3*121 = 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Compute 3*364. Let me calculate that: 364 * 3. Well, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Now, compute 3*1093. Let me do that step by step. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next, compute 3*3280. Hmm, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So adding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Now, compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524). Let's compute that. 29524*3. Hmm, let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all up.\n\nWait, that might be a bit tedious. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, so 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7.\nNext: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nSo, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake when multiplying large numbers.\n\nLet me recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems correct. Let me verify a couple of the intermediate steps.\n\nFor example, step 5: 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 3*364. Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then +1=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then +1=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 3*3280. Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then +1=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then +1=29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524. As above, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation instead of computing each step manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's a recursive structure. Let me try to represent this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a base case and work my way up.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers of nesting. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3) which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, actually, the number of layers is 9, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a_0 = 1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_8 or a_9? Let me count the number of parentheses.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3, each time we have another 1+3 until the ninth one. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication by 3: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, if I were to model this as a recurrence relation, it would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and n going up to 9.\n\nAlternatively, since each step is a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved me from manually computing each step, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of error.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I expand it, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I denote the entire expression as S, then S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next layer. But this seems similar to the recurrence approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression before the outermost multiplication by 3, it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and an additional 1 is added. But since each layer is dependent on the previous, it's a bit more involved.\n\nHowever, since we've already found a closed-form formula, we can confidently say that the value is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(29524) again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but when I write it down, the digits are 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the multiplication digit by digit, I got 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each step and even finding a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula checks out with each step. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous result). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate Each Layer:**\n   - Each subsequent layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from previous layer)}\\).\n   - Compute each layer step by step:\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n     - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

It seems like a recursive structure where each inner part is similar to the outer one. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with a 1, then adds 3 multiplied by another parentheses. So, the innermost part is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the next parentheses.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s and parentheses to make sure. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. Each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...), and this happens multiple times. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. So, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, maybe I can count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, the first ( is at position 2.\n2. Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis.

Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), then each subsequent layer has another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to work from the inside out. Let me define each layer as a variable to make it easier.\n\nLet me denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 1 + 3*(...), that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer)\n\nWait, maybe I can see that the innermost expression is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost part and work my way out.\n\nInnermost layer: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but hold on, in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, E2 = 3*(1 + E1), E3 = 3*(1 + E2), and so on.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, it's 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), which would be 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from E1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(5) = 15, then E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on.\n\nWait, but let me count how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are nine layers, each with 3*(1 + ...). Wait, no, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's eight layers because the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is one layer. Then, each time we go out, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So, the total number of layers would be nine, because the problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times...)))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so the final result would be 36084?\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me see how many E's I've calculated.\n\nE1: 4\n\nE2: 15\n\nE3: 48\n\nE4: 147\n\nE5: 444\n\nE6: 1335\n\nE7: 4008\n\nE8: 12027\n\nE9: 36084\n\nYes, that's nine layers, starting from E1 up to E9. So, the outermost expression is E9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each step again.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me verify one more time with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the values I've calculated:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 15\n\nE3 = 48\n\nE4 = 147\n\nE5 = 444\n\nE6 = 1335\n\nE7 = 4008\n\nE8 = 12027\n\nE9 = 36084\n\nLet me see the ratio between each E and the previous one.\n\nE2 = 15, which is 3*(1 + E1) = 3*5 = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(16) = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(49) = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(148) = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(445) = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1336) = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(4009) = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nYes, each step is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is defined as E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting from E1 = 4.\n\nSo, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1})\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3, with E1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, let me check: E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n\n-2*A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nWait, but that seems odd because our initial terms are positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nWait, let's double-check the recurrence.\n\nE_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nSo, E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 3\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n\n-2*A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1,\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3*C - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3*C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nC = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nE_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, so:\n\nE_n = (11/6)*3*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2:\n\nE_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nE1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nE4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444, wait, but earlier I had E4 as 147. Wait, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Because according to my earlier step-by-step calculation, E4 was 147, but according to this formula, E4 would be (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. That's a problem.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the recurrence.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step calculations again.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(5) = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(16) = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(49) = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(148) = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(445) = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1336) = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(4009) = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(12028) = 36084\n\nWait, so E4 is 147, but according to the formula I derived, E4 would be 444, which is actually E5 in the step-by-step. So, perhaps I made an error in the indexing.\n\nWait, in the formula, I considered n starting at 1, but in the step-by-step, E1 is the innermost, which is (1 + 3). But in the formula, maybe n=1 corresponds to the outermost expression. Wait, no, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula's index to match the step-by-step.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step, E1 is the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and E9 is the outermost expression. But in the formula, I used n=1 to correspond to E1, but perhaps in the formula, n=1 corresponds to the first application of the recurrence, which might not align with the step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula to match the step-by-step.\n\nWait, let's see: when I derived the formula, I assumed that E1 was the first term after the initial condition. But in the step-by-step, E1 is the innermost, which is (1 + 3). So, perhaps in the formula, n=1 corresponds to E1 in the step-by-step, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSo, according to the formula, E_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: E1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 15, correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 48, correct.\n\nn=4: E4 = (11*3^{3} - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147, correct.\n\nn=5: E5 = (11*3^{4} - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444, correct.\n\nn=6: E6 = (11*3^{5} - 3)/2 = (2673 - 3)/2 = 2670/2 = 1335, correct.\n\nn=7: E7 = (11*3^{6} - 3)/2 = (7932 - 3)/2 = 7929/2 = 3964.5, but wait, that's not matching the step-by-step E7 which was 4008.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Wait, 3^6 is 729, so 11*729 = 8019. 8019 - 3 = 8016. 8016/2 = 4008, which matches E7.\n\nWait, so E7 = (11*3^{6} - 3)/2 = (8019 - 3)/2 = 8016/2 = 4008, correct.\n\nSimilarly, E8 = (11*3^7 - 3)/2 = (11*2187 - 3)/2 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027, correct.\n\nE9 = (11*3^8 - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084, correct.\n\nWait, so the formula works correctly. So, for n=9, E9 = (11*3^8 - 3)/2 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute E9 using the formula:\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n11*6561 = let's compute that:\n\n6561 * 10 = 65610\n\n6561 * 1 = 6561\n\nSo, 65610 + 6561 = 72171\n\n72171 - 3 = 72168\n\n72168 / 2 = 36084\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the step-by-step calculation and the formula both lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I didn't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step approach. So, I'm confident that 36084 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with (1 + the result of the next inner layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n- Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4) = 15\n- Next: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 15) = 48\n- Next: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 48) = 147\n- Next: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 147) = 444\n- Next: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 444) = 1335\n- Next: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 1335) = 4008\n- Next: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4008) = 12027\n- Outermost layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I notice that this is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a pattern: starting from the innermost part, it's 1 plus 3 times something. So, maybe if I start solving from the inside and work my way out, it'll be easier. That makes sense because, in math, parentheses are solved from the innermost outward.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each time, the innermost one is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the next inner expression. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me start by numbering each layer for clarity. I'll number them from the innermost to the outermost, so layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result of layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, not added. So maybe I should adjust that. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on, nine times. So, perhaps I can compute each nested part step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9's result. So:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, I can compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, but 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3). Let's compute 476 * 3:\n\n476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410, +18 = 1428.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\n(4*3)=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n(2*3)=6 +1=7\n(5*3)=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n(2*3)=6 +2=8\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step layers, I went from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing the next layer. Let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of those layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, the final result before multiplying by 3 is 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364: 364*3 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093: 1,093*3 is 3,279, so 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280: 3,280*3 is 9,840, so 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841: 9,841*3 is 29,523, so 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * c + (initial term)*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, maybe I can find a closed-form formula here.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming it's a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check if the formula applies correctly. Since the first layer is n=1, and the outermost layer is n=9, so yes, a_9 is 29524, and then 3 times that is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in any case, both the step-by-step computation and the formula give me the same result, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, that's correct. Because 80,000*3=240,000, 8,000*3=24,000, 500*3=1,500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240,000 +24,000=264,000; 264,000 +1,500=265,500; 265,500 +210=265,710; 265,710 +9=265,719. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let me compute 88,573 * 3.\n\nCompute 80,000 *3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 *3=24,000, which adds to 264,000\n\n500*3=1,500, which brings it to 265,500\n\n70*3=210, so 265,500 +210=265,710\n\n3*3=9, so 265,710 +9=265,719.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was:\n\nInnermost: 4\n\nNext:13\n\nNext:40\n\nNext:121\n\nNext:364\n\nNext:1093\n\nNext:3280\n\nNext:9841\n\nNext:29524\n\nNext:88573\n\nOutermost:265,719.\n\nWait, but let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous result) +1.\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, it's another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nEach time it's 1 + 3(...). So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) => first layer\n2. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) => second layer\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to see how many times 3(1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3( is the outermost. Then inside, it's 1 + 3(...), which is the next layer. Each time, it's another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) => first layer: 3*(...)\n2. Inside that: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) => second layer\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) => third layer\n4. Continuing: fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth.\n\nWait, so is there a total of 10 layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3( is followed by 1+3(...), which is one layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another 3(, so that's two layers.\n\nContinuing, each time we have another 3(, so let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 1\n2. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 2\n3. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 3\n4. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 4\n5. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 5\n6. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 6\n7. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 7\n8. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 8\n9. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 9\n10. 3(1 + 3(...) => layer 10\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 10? Wait, that can't be. Because each layer is a 3*(...) +1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3(...), that's one.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(...), that's two.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) => layer 1\n2. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 2\n3. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 3\n4. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 4\n5. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 5\n6. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 6\n7. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 7\n8. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 8\n9. Inside that: 1 + 3(...)) => layer 9\n10. Inside that: 1 + 3 => layer 10\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 10: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 9: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, right? So, each step, starting from the innermost, we compute each layer and work our way out. So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nBut let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 10: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each multiplication:\n\n3*4=12, 12+1=13\n\n3*13=39, 39+1=40\n\n3*40=120, 120+1=121\n\n3*121=363, 363+1=364\n\n3*364=1092, 1092+1=1093\n\n3*1093=3279, 3279+1=3280\n\n3*3280=9840, 9840+1=9841\n\n3*9841=29523, 29523+1=29524\n\n3*29524=88572, 88572+1=88573\n\n3*88573=265,719.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final result is 265,719.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and I double-checked each multiplication and addition. So, yeah, the answer should be 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step until the outermost layer is reached.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 10):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Layer 1:**\n    \\[\n    1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n    \\]\n\n11. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 88573 = 265719\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{265719}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like there are multiple layers here, so maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me start there.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So substituting 4 in, it becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\n2. Compute 3*4: 3*4 = 12.\n3. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo now, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result from step 3). Let's do that.\n\n4. Compute 3*13: 3*13 = 39.\n5. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 5).\n\n6. Compute 3*40: 3*40 = 120.\n7. Then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 7).\n\n8. Compute 3*121: 3*121 = 363.\n9. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 9).\n\n10. Compute 3*364: 3*364. Let me calculate that. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092.\n11. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 11).\n\n12. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279.\n13. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 13).\n\n14. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n15. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 15).\n\n16. Compute 3*9841: Let's break this down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523.\n17. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 17).\n\n18. Compute 3*29524: Let's calculate this. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n19. Then add 1: 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 19).\n\n20. Compute 3*88573: Let me break this down. 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding them together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573 * 3:\n\n- 3*3 = 9\n- 3*7 = 21, carryover 2\n- 3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n- 3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n- 3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n- 3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n- 3*0 = 0 + 2 = 2\n- 3*8 = 24, but wait, 88573 is a 5-digit number, so actually:\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the breakdown earlier. Let me write it out properly.\n\n88573 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 265719. So that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 265719.\n\nBut wait, let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations because this seems quite large, and I want to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 3*9841 = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572; 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Each time, I'm multiplying the result by 3 and then adding 1, except for the very last step where I just multiply by 3. So, the final result is indeed 265719.\n\nI think that's it. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but by taking it one step at a time, I managed to compute the value without making any errors. I guess the key here was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, carefully computing each step to avoid mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except for the final step which only involves multiplying by 3.\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Substitute back into the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Continue substituting and simplifying each layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 88573 = 265719\\)\n\nThe final result is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3\" is followed by another parenthesis, except the last one. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(...\n2. Then another (1+3(...\n3. And so on, until the last one is (1+3).\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the first 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...\n- Then another (1+3(...\n- Continuing until the last one, which is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"(\" are there after the first 3? Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression, it's 3 followed by 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Wait, no, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the last one is (1+3). So, total layers: 9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\", it's 9 times, right? Because each layer adds another \"1+3(\" until the last one is just (1+3).\n\nSo, total layers: 9.\n\nTherefore, starting from the innermost layer, which is (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute each step:\n\nLet me list them:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the steps correctly. Since there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost as Step1, then each subsequent step adds a layer until Step9 is the outermost.\n\nBut wait, in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...). So, after computing Step9, which is the innermost part, we need to multiply by 3 each time as we go outwards. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(inner result), so each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 steps, the result would be the innermost part, but then we have to multiply by 3 at each layer.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the steps. Let me clarify.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers of 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3)=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, the innermost result is 4, then each layer adds a new step. Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here because each layer is a multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps the correct way is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then building up.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Step9, I got 29524, but that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me try a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, three layers.\n\nCompute innermost first: (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but according to my previous method, I would have done 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*40 = 120. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, in that case, with 3 layers, the result is 120.\n\nWait, but according to my previous calculation, when I did 9 layers, I ended up with 29524, which seems plausible, but let me check the steps again.\n\nWait, in the 3-layer example, the innermost is (1+3)=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 3*40=120.\n\nSo, each layer adds one more step, and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, in the 3-layer example, the innermost is (1+3)=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, and then the outermost is 3*40=120.\n\nWait, so in that case, the number of layers is 3, and the result is 120.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, there are 9 layers inside the 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to Step9 as 29524, but that was after 9 steps, each being 1 + 3*(previous). But perhaps that's not the correct approach because the outermost is 3*(...), so I should compute the innermost first, then each layer up to the outermost, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the number of layers inside the 3* is 9, each being 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, the result inside is R, and then the outermost is 3*R.\n\nWait, so perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I included the outermost multiplication in the steps. Let me correct that.\n\nLet me compute the innermost first:\n\nStep1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing the innermost 9 layers, the result is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I thought that the outermost was included in the 9 steps, but now I'm seeing that the outermost is 3*(result of 9 layers). So, perhaps I should compute the 9 layers first, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the 3-layer example, the result was 120, which is 3*(40), where 40 is the result of 2 layers inside. Wait, no, in the 3-layer example, the innermost was (1+3)=4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and then 3*40=120. So, in that case, the number of layers inside the 3* was 3, but the computation steps were 3 layers inside, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the number of layers inside the 3* is 9, so after computing the 9 layers, we have to multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I included the outermost multiplication in the steps, so I ended up with 29524, but that's actually the result inside the 3*, so the total result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the 3-layer example. If I compute the innermost 3 layers as 4,13,40, then the outermost is 3*40=120. So, in the original problem, after computing 9 layers, I have 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I included the outermost multiplication in the steps, leading to an incorrect result.\n\nWait, let me recast the problem. The original expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the result of the innermost 9 layers. So, L9 is computed as:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that would be the correct approach. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to make sure.\n\nTake the expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, 3 layers inside.\n\nCompute L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*L3 = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich is correct, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, after computing L9=29524, the result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that after 9 steps, I had 29524, which would be L9, then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me confirm the calculations step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the result of 9 layers. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but given that it's only 9 layers, it's easier to compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the result of the nested expression is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me see if I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each containing a 1 and a 3 multiplied together. It seems like a recursive structure, where each part depends on the result of the next one. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is $1+3(1+3)$. Wait, but I just computed the inner part as 4, so this becomes $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives 13. So, that middle part simplifies to 13.\n\nWait, maybe I should write this down more systematically to avoid confusion. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say the innermost is level 1, then the next one is level 2, and so on up to level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, counting them, I see there are nine opening parentheses, so nine levels.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3\nLevel 2: 1+3(...)\nLevel 3: 1+3(...)\n...\nLevel 9: 3(...)\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each level as starting from the innermost and working outward. So, starting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1 result). Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(Level 8 result) = 3*9841. Let's compute that: 9841 * 3. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first level. Then each subsequent level adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many levels are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, that means there are nine levels. So, my earlier approach is correct, with levels 1 through 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed Level 9, I got 29523, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check each multiplication to be sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40=120, so 1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 363. 1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9841*3. Let me break it down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nNow, add them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the levels. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nSo, yes, there are nine levels. So, my calculation up to Level 9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each level step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach level seems to follow the pattern: Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1). Starting from Level 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Level n.\n\nThe recursive formula is Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1), with Level 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Level n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's substitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Level n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, Level 1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is Level n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLevel n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nLevel 1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nLevel 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n(3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Level 9:\n\nLevel 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Level 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that's different from my earlier result of 29523. Hmm, that's a problem. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the formula, Level n = (3^(n+1)-1)/2. So, for n=9, Level 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nBut when I computed step by step, I got 29523. There's a discrepancy here. So, one of my calculations must be wrong.\n\nLet me check the step-by-step computation again, especially Level 9.\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nBut according to the formula, Level 9 should be 29524. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step computation again.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*Level7.\n\nLevel7 was 3280.\n\nSo, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9: 3*9841. Let's compute that again.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it should be 29524. So, there's a discrepancy of 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is incorrect? Or perhaps I misapplied it.\n\nWait, the formula was derived for Level n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nBut in our case, Level 9 corresponds to n=9, so (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nBut step-by-step, I get 29523. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me recount the levels.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of nested parentheses:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a level, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 levels.\n\nWait, but in the formula, Level 1 corresponds to the innermost, which is correct. So, Level 9 is the outermost, which is multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the formula, Level n is defined as 1 + 3*(Level n-1), starting from Level 1=4.\n\nBut in the expression, the outermost is 3*(Level 8). So, perhaps the formula gives Level 9 as (3^10 -1)/2, but in the expression, it's 3*(Level 8), which is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Let me compute that.\n\nCompute Level 8 using the formula: (3^9 -1)/2. 3^9 is 19683. So, (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, which matches my step-by-step.\n\nThen, Level 9 is 3*Level8 = 3*9841=29523, which is correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, Level 9 should be (3^10 -1)/2=29524. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts one more level? Let me think.\n\nWait, the formula was derived for the nth level, where each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, Level 1=4, Level 2=13, Level3=40, etc., up to Level9=29524.\n\nBut in the expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Level8), which is 3*9841=29523, which is one less than the formula's result.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula includes the initial 3, whereas in the expression, the initial 3 is outside.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The formula was derived for Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1). So, starting from Level1=4, each subsequent Level is built by that formula.\n\nBut in the expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Level8). So, perhaps the formula's Level9 is equivalent to 3*(Level8). Let me check.\n\nFrom the formula, Level9 = (3^10 -1)/2=29524.\n\nBut 3*(Level8)=3*(9841)=29523.\n\nSo, 29524 vs 29523. They differ by 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is actually Level n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, but in our case, the expression is 3*(Level8), which is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Let's compute that:\n\n3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) = (3^10 -3)/2.\n\nWhich is (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523. Which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, the formula gives Level9 as (3^10 -1)/2=29524, but the expression is 3*(Level8)= (3^10 -3)/2=29523.\n\nSo, the difference is because the formula counts the outermost operation as 1 + 3*(Level8), but in the expression, it's just 3*(Level8). Therefore, the formula is for a structure that has one more level of 1 + 3*(...), whereas our expression stops at 3*(Level8). So, in our case, the total expression is 3*(Level8), which is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 )= (3^10 -3)/2=29523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the formula was giving Level9 as 29524, but that's because I was considering the formula's Level9 as the result of 1 + 3*(Level8), which isn't the case in the original expression. The original expression ends with 3*(Level8), not 1 + 3*(Level8). So, the formula's Level9 is not applicable here. Therefore, the correct computation is 3*(Level8)=29523.\n\nSo, to summarize, the step-by-step computation gives 29523, and the formula, when correctly applied, also gives 29523 when considering the structure of the original problem.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once again by computing Level9 as 3*(Level8)=3*9841=29523. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as (3^10 -3)/2=59049-3=59046; 59046/2=29523. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. It was a bit confusing with the formula, but breaking it down step by step and verifying each level helped me spot the discrepancy and correct it.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Level 9**: \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part is inside another part. So, the innermost part is $1+3$, and then each subsequent part adds another layer of $1+3$ multiplied by 3. It seems like a repeated pattern, so maybe I can work from the inside out, solving each innermost parentheses first and then moving outward.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is $1 + 3$. Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 1})$.\n3. I'll continue this process, each time computing the innermost part first and then moving outward until I reach the outermost parentheses.\n\nLet me start by computing each layer step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses**\n\nThe innermost expression is $1 + 3$. Let me calculate that:\n\n$1 + 3 = 4$\n\nSo, the innermost parentheses equals 4.\n\n**Step 2: Move one layer out**\n\nNow, the next layer is $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 1})$. Since Step 1 gave me 4, I substitute that in:\n\n$1 + 3(4)$\n\nFirst, compute the multiplication:\n\n$3 \\times 4 = 12$\n\nThen add 1:\n\n$1 + 12 = 13$\n\nSo, this layer equals 13.\n\n**Step 3: Next layer out**\n\nMoving outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 2})$. Substituting 13:\n\n$1 + 3(13)$\n\nCompute the multiplication first:\n\n$3 \\times 13 = 39$\n\nThen add 1:\n\n$1 + 39 = 40$\n\nThis layer equals 40.\n\n**Step 4: Next layer**\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 3})$. Substituting 40:\n\n$1 + 3(40)$\n\nMultiplication first:\n\n$3 \\times 40 = 120$\n\nAdd 1:\n\n$1 + 120 = 121$\n\nSo, this layer is 121.\n\n**Step 5: Next layer**\n\nMoving outward again, the expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 4})$. Substituting 121:\n\n$1 + 3(121)$\n\nCompute the multiplication:\n\n$3 \\times 121 = 363$\n\nAdd 1:\n\n$1 + 363 = 364$\n\nThis layer equals 364.\n\n**Step 6: Next layer**\n\nContinuing outward, we have $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 5})$. Substituting 364:\n\n$1 + 3(364)$\n\nFirst, multiply:\n\n$3 \\times 364 = 1092$\n\nThen add 1:\n\n$1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nThis layer equals 1093.\n\n**Step 7: Next layer**\n\nThe next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 6})$. Substituting 1093:\n\n$1 + 3(1093)$\n\nCompute the multiplication:\n\n$3 \\times 1093 = 3279$\n\nAdd 1:\n\n$1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nSo, this layer is 3280.\n\n**Step 8: Next layer**\n\nMoving outward, the expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 7})$. Substituting 3280:\n\n$1 + 3(3280)$\n\nFirst, multiply:\n\n$3 \\times 3280 = 9840$\n\nAdd 1:\n\n$1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nThis layer equals 9841.\n\n**Step 9: Next layer**\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{result from Step 8})$. Substituting 9841:\n\n$1 + 3(9841)$\n\nCompute the multiplication:\n\n$3 \\times 9841 = 29523$\n\nAdd 1:\n\n$1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nThis layer equals 29524.\n\n**Step 10: Finally, the outermost layer**\n\nNow, we're at the outermost parentheses. The expression is $3(\\text{result from Step 9})$. Substituting 29524:\n\n$3 \\times 29524$\n\nLet me compute this multiplication:\n\nFirst, let me break it down:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 3 \\times (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24)$\n\nCompute each part:\n\n- $3 \\times 20000 = 60000$\n- $3 \\times 9000 = 27000$\n- $3 \\times 500 = 1500$\n- $3 \\times 24 = 72$\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n$60000 + 27000 = 87000$\n\n$87000 + 1500 = 88500$\n\n$88500 + 72 = 88572$\n\nSo, $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEach step seems correct. So, I think my final answer is right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na\u2081\u2080 = 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, each term is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1:\n\n4 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each a\u2099, it's (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\na\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na\u2083 = (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na\u2084 = (3\u2075 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, this formula works. So, for each a\u2099, it's (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me count how many a\u2099 terms we have.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 13\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 40\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 121\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 364\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1093\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 3280\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 9841\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*a\u2089 = 88572\n\nSo, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying a\u2089 by 3. So, in terms of the a\u2099 sequence, the total expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nGiven that a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2, let me compute that.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070:\n\n3\u00b9 = 3\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n3\u00b3 = 27\n\n3\u2074 = 81\n\n3\u2075 = 243\n\n3\u2076 = 729\n\n3\u2077 = 2187\n\n3\u2078 = 6561\n\n3\u2079 = 19683\n\n3\u00b9\u2070 = 59049\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can directly compute the result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. However, recognizing the pattern and finding the closed-form formula is a good skill to have for more complex problems.\n\nAlternatively, I could also think of this as a sum of a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nStarting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like each term is 1 + 3*sum of the previous terms. Hmm, that might complicate things more, but perhaps it can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf I denote S as the total sum, but in this case, it's not a straightforward sum because each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1. So, it's more like a recursive sequence rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nSo, maybe the closed-form formula I found earlier is the most straightforward approach.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nLet me just confirm the multiplication step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2\n- 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing.

Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, it should be a 5 or 6-digit number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the digit positions.\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    \u00d7     3\n    -----------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing it from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8 \u2192 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, all my calculations are correct, and the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive or nested structure, so maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually works with parentheses.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to label each level to keep track.\n\nLet me number the innermost parentheses as Level 1, then the next one as Level 2, and so on, up to Level 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3s. Each time, the expression is 3 times something, and inside that something is (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), that's the first level. Then each time, moving outward, we have another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have:\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1 result) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, at Level 2, it's 3*(1 + Level 1 result). So, Level 1 was 4, so 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. That's correct.\n\nThen, Level 3 would be 3*(1 + Level 2 result) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but actually, looking back at the original expression, each level is 3*(1 + next level). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous level result). So, I can compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me tabulate this:\n\n- Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n- Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n- Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n- Level 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n- Level 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n- Level 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n- Level 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n- Level 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n- Level 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so after computing each level, starting from the innermost, each time the result is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the first level is 4, then 15, 48, 147, and so on, up to Level 9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting the levels correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each with a 3 multiplied. So, starting from the innermost, each step adds a level. So, Level 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), Level 2 is the next one out, etc., up to Level 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I compute Level 9, is that the entire expression? Let me see.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 levels. So, the outermost is Level 9, which is 3*(1 + Level 8). So, if I compute up to Level 9, that should be the final result.\n\nBut let me verify my calculations step by step, because the numbers are growing quite rapidly, and I might have made a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so according to this, the final result is 36,084. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me count the number of 3s in the original expression to make sure.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a 3 multiplier. Let's count the number of 3s:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time there's a 3 before a parenthesis. So, how many times does 3( occur?\n\nLet me count: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the start:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of 3(, so that means there are 9 levels. So, my earlier calculation of 9 levels is correct. Therefore, the final result is indeed 36,084.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize a pattern or a recursive formula. Let me try to model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the expression with n levels. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, for each subsequent level, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nFirst, let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nNow, to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3*1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nK = 3*(1 + K)\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 3 + 3K\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to express it as is.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 \u00f7 6:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, multiply by 11:\n\n3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nLet's compute 3280 * 11 = 36,080\n\nThen, 0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is indeed 36,084.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the closed-form formula again step by step.\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nFor n=9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nWe know 3^9 = 19,683\n\nSo,\n\n(11/6)*19,683 = ?\n\nFirst, compute 19,683 \u00f7 6:\n\n19,683 \u00f7 6 = 3,280.5\n\nThen, 3,280.5 * 11 = ?\n\n3,280 * 11 = 36,080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute a_9 using the recurrence relation and verify once more.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each step as multiplying by 3 and adding 3*(1 - 1) or something, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the numbers:\n\nLooking at the a_n values:\n\nn: 1, a_n: 4\n\nn: 2, a_n: 15\n\nn: 3, a_n: 48\n\nn: 4, a_n: 147\n\nn: 5, a_n: 444\n\nn: 6, a_n: 1335\n\nn: 7, a_n: 4008\n\nn: 8, a_n: 12027\n\nn: 9, a_n: 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Wait, let's see:\n\nFrom a_1 to a_2: 4 to 15, which is 3*(4 + 1) = 15\n\nFrom a_2 to a_3: 15 to 48, which is 3*(15 + 1) = 48\n\nSimilarly, each time, it's 3*(a_{n-1} + 1)\n\nWhich is exactly the recurrence relation we have.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see how the closed-form formula was derived.\n\nWe had the recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWhich can be rewritten as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = 11/6\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWhich, as we saw earlier, gives us a_9 = 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, we can factor 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, so:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nBut that might not necessarily make it simpler.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write it as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nBecause:\n\n(11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nYes, because 3/2 is equal to 9/6, so:\n\n(11*3^n)/6 - 9/6 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nLet me check this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n(11*27 -9)/6 = (297 -9)/6=288/6=48, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n(11*81 -9)/6=(891-9)/6=882/6=147, correct.\n\nn=5:\n\n(11*243 -9)/6=(2673-9)/6=2664/6=444, correct.\n\nn=6:\n\n(11*729 -9)/6=(8019-9)/6=8010/6=1335, correct.\n\nn=7:\n\n(11*2187 -9)/6=(24057-9)/6=24048/6=4008, correct.\n\nn=8:\n\n(11*6561 -9)/6=(72171-9)/6=72162/6=12027, correct.\n\nn=9:\n\n(11*19683 -9)/6=(216513-9)/6=216504/6=36084, correct.\n\nYes, that formula works as well.\n\nSo, using either method, we arrive at the same result, 36,084.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the computed value of the original expression is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3. By systematically evaluating each level, we find that the final result is 36,084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form 3*(1 + ...).

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive or repetitive structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Let me count them: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(result of step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(result of step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSince there are nine layers, I can work from the inside out, computing each layer one by one. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, hold on. Is it 1 + 3*(result) or 1 + 3*(result)? Let me check the original expression. It's 3(1 + 3(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Hmm, maybe I misapplied the first step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify the structure. Let me parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ) )). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the entire expression is 3*(that result).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as a term inside another. Let me try to define it recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers from the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as starting from the innermost and building up.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(...)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(...)\n... and so on until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3s and parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside, another (1 + 3(...))\n- Repeating until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each layer adds another opening parenthesis, so let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first layer after the initial 3, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check my arithmetic again because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 in another way. Let's break down 29524 into 29000 + 524.\n\n29000 \u00d7 3 = 87000.\n\n524 \u00d7 3 = 1572.\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so that's the second layer.\n\nContinuing until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach time we have an opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, then each ( inside adds another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. ( after 3: layer 1\n2. ( inside that: layer 2\n3. ( inside that: layer 3\n4. ( inside that: layer 4\n5. ( inside that: layer 5\n6. ( inside that: layer 6\n7. ( inside that: layer 7\n8. ( inside that: layer 8\n9. ( inside that: layer 9\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the first 3, the first ( starts layer 1, then inside that, another ( for layer 2, and so on until the innermost, which is layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, so how many layers does that correspond to?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me think again.\n\nEach time you have a 1 + 3(...), that's a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result).\n\nWait, that would mean that there are 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the outermost 3*.\n\nBut in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the first (1 + 3(...)) after the initial 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), that's layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer's result), and then the outermost is 3*(Layer 9 result).\n\nSo, the calculations I did earlier, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572, should be correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + C\n\nWhere A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = A*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSubtract 3C from both sides:\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, a_1 corresponds to the first layer, which is 4. Let me check:\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWhich can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nWait, but a_0 would be undefined here because our initial condition is a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps that approach is complicating things. The closed-form using the recurrence is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me see if I can tackle this.\n\nFirst off, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It seems like it's repeating multiple times. Let me try to figure out how many layers there are. Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I think there are nine sets of parentheses. So, it's like a chain of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something), and that something is another similar expression. That must mean I need to work from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards.\n\nAlright, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that part becomes 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, we add 1 to that. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check: each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, after computing the innermost (1+3) as 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). So that would be 1 + 12, which is 13.\n\nWait, I think I might have messed that up. Let me clarify. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's 4. Then, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, each expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, if I have, say, the innermost as 4, then the next one is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on. So, it's like each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I need to compute this step by step, moving outward each time.\n\nLet me try to list out each step so I don't get lost. Let's number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, maybe? Wait, actually, let me count how many times the 3*(1 + ...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing all layers up to the ninth one, the result is 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, and then each layer adds 1 + 3*previous, as I did before, up to layer 9, which gives 29524. But that 29524 is the result inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Wait, no, hold on. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, when I computed up to the ninth layer, I actually got the innermost expression, which is the ninth layer. But then, the outermost 3 is multiplied by that. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me write it down step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me define a_1 as the innermost term, which is (1 + 3). Then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 is 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on until a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if a_9 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations again because 88572 seems a bit big, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through each layer again carefully.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do this step by step, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each a_i again.\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the a_i's check out. So, a_9 is indeed 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can approach this problem from a different angle, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try that.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nHmm, that's a fractional value, which is a bit unexpected, but let's see. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe know B = -1/2, so:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that once more. 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, and it still gives me 88572. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, hold on, that's 10 layers. But earlier, I only went up to a_9, which would correspond to 9 layers. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then moving out, each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n\nEach time, the number increases. Let me count:\n\n- The first opening after 3 is the first (1+3(...))\n- Then another (1+3(...)) inside that\n- Continuing until the end.\n\nSo, the total number of (1+3(...)) sections is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I thought it was 9 layers, leading to a_9. But when I tried to count the number of \"1+3(\" instances, I thought it was 10. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Each (1+3(...) requires a closing ). Let me count the number of closing parentheses.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer has one more closing parenthesis.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which has one closing )\n- The next layer is (1+3(...)), which has two closing )\n- Wait, no, each time, it's a new (1+3(...)), so each layer adds another set.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead think of each (1+3(...)) as a layer, so starting from the innermost, each layer is one more (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3)\n\nThen layer 2: 1+3(layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to layer9:1+3(layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, leading to a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nBut to make absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the approach works.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller version with just two layers:\n\n3(1+3(1+3))\n\nCompute this:\n\nInnermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=13\n\nThen, outermost:3*13=39\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, then 3*a_2=39.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for three layers:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\nCompute:\n\nInnermost:4\n\nNext:1+3*4=13\n\nNext:1+3*13=40\n\nOutermost:3*40=120\n\nUsing formula: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, then 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, for each layer, the formula holds. Therefore, for 9 layers, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and total expression=3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), leading to a sequence that grows exponentially. By calculating each layer step by step and applying the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find the result to be 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplied by 3 and added to 1. It seems like a recursive structure where each layer is similar to the one before it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, counting the number of layers, I think there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times the next layer. Let me try to count them: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 3(1 + ...). So, let's start from the innermost and work our way out.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. That might help me keep track.\n\nSo, starting with L1: (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, L2: 1 + 3*(L1). So, substituting L1's value:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so L2 is 13.\n\nNext layer, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL4 is 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL5 is 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL6 is 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3. Let me do that step by step. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check: 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Yes, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then +1 is 3280. Okay, so L7 is 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, L9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(L9). Because the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing L9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer was (1 + 3), which is 4, so a_1 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, starting from a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is L9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation formula, we arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe recognizing that each layer is part of a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be thought of as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but each term is also multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me try to express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nIf I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nBut the inner part is similar to S itself, except without the initial 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's define S as the innermost expression: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), which is 3*(S'), where S' = 1 + 3*S''.\n\nBut this might complicate things more. Alternatively, since we already have a formula for a_n, and we know that the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572, maybe that's the simplest way.\n\nBut just to explore another angle, let me consider expanding the entire expression.\n\nEach time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so if we expand it, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nBut that seems like it would lead to an infinite series, but in our case, it's finite with nine layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLooking back at the formula we derived: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with nine layers.\n\nEach layer adds another 1 and multiplies by 3. So, in terms of powers of 3, each subsequent layer contributes 3^{k} where k increases by 1 each time.\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nIf I have L1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nBut in terms of powers, 13 can be written as 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, L3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nBut 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Yes, that's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait a second, so each layer a_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nBecause a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\na_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWhich is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, r=3, so S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches our earlier formula.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThis seems consistent across different methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series.\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with such large exponents, let me recheck 3^10.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049. Subtract 1: 59048. Divide by 2: 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nAlright, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\), where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost.\n\n1.

    "text": " Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 multiplied by another similar expression. It seems like a recursive structure, where each part is similar to the whole. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see the structure better. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n3. I'll keep doing this, each time computing the next layer by using the result from the previous step.\n\nSo, let me list each layer step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3)\n= 1 + 3\n= 4\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 1))\n= 1 + 3*4\n= 1 + 12\n= 13\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. 3*(4) is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, that seems right.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out: (1 + 3*(result from Step 2))\n= 1 + 3*13\n= 1 + 39\n= 40\n\nHmm, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Got it.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 3))\n= 1 + 3*40\n= 1 + 120\n= 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that's correct.\n\nStep 5: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 4))\n= 1 + 3*121\n= 1 + 363\n= 364\n\nLet me verify: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yep.\n\nStep 6: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 5))\n= 1 + 3*364\n= 1 + 1092\n= 1093\n\nHmm, 3*364. Let me compute that again. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is indeed 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 6))\n= 1 + 3*1093\n= 1 + 3279\n= 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 7))\n= 1 + 3*3280\n= 1 + 9840\n= 9841\n\nLet me check 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Right.\n\nStep 9: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from Step 8))\n= 1 + 3*9841\n= 1 + 29523\n= 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from Step 9)\n= 3*29524\n= ?\n\nWait, so the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing all the inner layers, we get 29524, and then we multiply that by 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000*3=60000\n- 9000*3=27000\n- 500*3=1500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. 29524*3:\n\n- 29524 * 3:\nStart from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n2. (1 + 3*4)=13\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n10. 3*29524=88572\n\nEach step seems correct. I don't see any calculation errors. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should compute one of the steps again to make sure.\n\nLet me recheck step 5: (1 + 3*121). 3*121=363, 363+1=364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*364). 3*364=1092, 1092+1=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093=3279, 3279+1=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280=9840, 9840+1=9841.

Each step builds on the previous one without any miscalculations. So, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step.\n\n1.

Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards.

Then, each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSince there are nine layers, I'll need to compute each one sequentially. Let me number them from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses.\nExpression: 1 + 3\nCalculation: 1 + 3 = 4\nSo, result1 = 4\n\nStep 2: Move one layer out. Now, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(result1)\nExpression: 1 + 3*(4)\nCalculation: 3*4 = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\nSo, result2 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next layer out.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. It's easy to miscalculate with so many layers.\n\nLet me go back through each step:\n\n1. result1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. result2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. result3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. result4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. result5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. result6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. result7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. result8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. result9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the intermediate results look correct. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from the inside out.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n3. Optionally, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to confirm the result.\n4. Multiply the final inner result by 3 to get the overall answer.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also emphasized the importance of careful step-by-step computation to avoid errors, especially with multiple layers of operations.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led to the same result.

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst off, I notice that this is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a pattern where each inner expression is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, if I start from the inside, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)).\n3. Then, the next one is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)).\n4. This pattern continues until we reach the outermost parentheses.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Hmm, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3). Then, each time we have another (1+3(...)) surrounding it. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3(, the first (1+3 is the innermost. Then, each time, we have another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, the next layer is (1+3(...))\n3. So, each time, we add another layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of layers. Let me write down each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since I can see that the innermost is (1+3), and then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should count how many times 1+3 is being added. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer8))\n\nAnd then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of (1+3*(...)) starting from Layer1 to Layer9, and then the whole thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, let me count again. Let me see: Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think of it as a sequence of operations, each time computing the innermost parentheses first.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, Layer2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. Let me recount each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me make sure that I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we add a layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outer, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so how many layers is that?\n\nStarting from the innermost, (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we add another layer, so the next one is (1 + 3*(layer1)), which is layer2.\n\nContinuing this way, up to layer9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, each time computing (1 + 3*previous_layer).\n\nSo, after computing up to layer9, which is 29,524, then multiplying by 3 gives us 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication for layer9 to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer8: 9,841\n\nSo, 3*9,841: Let's compute 9,841*3.\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000\n\n800*3 = 2,400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, layer9 is correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000*3 = 60,000\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20,000 + 9,000 is 29,000, plus 500 is 29,500, plus 24 is 29,524. So, yes.\n\nSo, 20,000*3 = 60,000\n\n9,000*3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 20,000 + 9,000 is 29,000, but when multiplying by 3, it's 29,000*3 = 87,000.\n\nThen, 500*3 = 1,500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nSo, 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check each layer again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f, which is correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, using the formula approach, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nBut since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0 would be 1.\n\nWait, actually, if we set n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, and since a_1=4, then 4=1 +3*a_0 => a_0=1.\n\nSo, the general formula would be a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_0.\n\nSince a_0=1, this becomes a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*1.\n\nThe sum sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, so sum = (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) )= (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 3^{n} = (3^{n} -1 + 2*3^{n}) /2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches our earlier formula.\n\nSo, using this approach, we again confirm that a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29,524, and then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also using a formula approach, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression to visualize it better. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the very first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, and inside that, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression, and so on.

So, the entire expression would be 3*S_9.\n\nSo, my goal is to compute S_1 through S_9 and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nLet me compute each S_i step by step.\n\nStarting with S_1:\n\nS_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to S_3:\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so far, so good.\n\nS_4 = 1 + 3*S_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS_5 = 1 + 3*S_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS_6 = 1 + 3*S_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS_7 = 1 + 3*S_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS_8 = 1 + 3*S_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS_9 = 1 + 3*S_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*S_9, so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, carryover 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 *3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 *3 = 27,000\n\n500 *3 = 1,500\n\n20 *3 = 60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000 =87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for S_9, because sometimes when doing recursive steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through S_1 to S_9 again:\n\nS_1 =1+3=4\n\nS_2=1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nS_3=1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nS_4=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nS_5=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nS_6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nS_7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nS_8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nS_9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check S_8 again because 3*3280 is 9840, which is correct, so S_8=1+9840=9841.\n\nThen S_9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 88,572 seems like a big number, but considering the number of layers, maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a formula for S_n.\n\nLooking at the recursive formula: S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nCompute the first few terms:\n\nS_1 =4\n\nS_2=13= 1 +3*4=13\n\nS_3=1 +3*13=40\n\nS_4=1 +3*40=121\n\nS_5=1 +3*121=364\n\nS_6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nS_7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nS_8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nS_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nWait, I notice that each term is one more than three times the previous term.\n\nSo, S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found as follows:\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: S_n -3*S_{n-1}=0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3.\n\nThen, find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say S_p.\n\nAssume S_p = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's take n=1, S_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, S_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nS_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, S_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*S_9=3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10}=59,049? Yes, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, yes, S_9= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentials.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, S_9= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3))).\n\nEach time, it's 1 +3*something, which is similar to the expansion of a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a finite series, so perhaps the formula for the sum of a geometric series can be applied.\n\nBut since each term is 1 +3*previous, it's a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived, S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29,524.\n\nThen, 3*S_9=3*(29,524)=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer and then multiply the final result by 3. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a formula, we find that the result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure, where each layer is similar to the one inside it. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times another expression. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then building up each layer.\n\nLet me number each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, starting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Let me compute that:\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. But the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\nThen, 3 * 500 = 1500\nThen, 3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from the bottom up: 87572.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got before. Hmm, so 29524 * 3 = 87572, not 88572. I must have made a mistake in my earlier multiplication.\n\nWait, let me do it again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572. So I must have miscalculated when I broke it down into 20000, 9000, etc. Let me check that method again.\n\nBreaking down 29524:\n\n20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but that's inconsistent with the direct multiplication which gave me 87572. So where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. The breakdown method is incorrect because 29524 is not 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Let's check:\n\n20000 + 9000 = 29000\n\n29000 + 500 = 29500\n\n29500 + 24 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 should be 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to verify.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 88572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method.\n\nLet me write it out again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the breakdown method gives 88572. There's a contradiction here. Let me check the digit positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing. Let me write it out properly with place values.\n\n29524 is:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)\n9 (thousands place)\n5 (hundreds place)\n2 (tens place)\n4 (ones place)\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\nStarting from the ones place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Wait, no, carry over is 1, so 9*3=27 +1=28? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, when you multiply 9 by 3, you get 27. So you write down 7 and carry over 2.\n\nWait, that's where I might have gone wrong earlier.\n\nSo, thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 7, 8.\n\nWait, that would be 87572.\n\nBut according to the breakdown method, it's 88572. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 29524 * 3 using another method, perhaps adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, so in my earlier digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me check again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n\nOnes place: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Wait, no, 9*3=27, so write 7 and carry over 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (ones). So, 87572. But that contradicts the addition method which gave me 88572.\n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me try to compute 29524 * 3 using another approach, perhaps using the standard multiplication algorithm step by step.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Wait, no, 9*3=27, so write 7 and carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using a calculator to verify.\n\nWait, I don't have a calculator here, but I can do it another way.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 88572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing the result. Let me check the digit positions again.\n\nWhen I multiply 29524 by 3, the result should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, 2 in the ones place, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, 7 in the tens place.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. So, 5 in the hundreds place, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. So, 8 in the thousands place, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 8 in the ten thousands place.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (ones). Wait, that would be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 87572. So, I must have made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me correct that.\n\nWhen multiplying the thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carry over of 1 from the hundreds place, which makes 28. So, write down 8 in the thousands place and carry over 2 to the ten thousands place.\n\nThen, the ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (ones). So, 88572.\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong earlier. I mistakenly wrote down 7 in the thousands place instead of 8. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes in the layers.\n\nStarting again from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
