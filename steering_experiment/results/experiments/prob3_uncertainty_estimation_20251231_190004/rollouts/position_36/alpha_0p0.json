    "text": " 3 * 29524 = ? Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it down step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nFinally, the next digit is 0 (since 29524 is 29,524, so the next digit is 0), 0 \u00d7 3 = 0 + 2 (carry over from previous step?) Wait, no, I think I went beyond the number. Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so when multiplying, we go digit by digit:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 +1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +2 =8 \u21928, carry 0\n- Then, since there are no more digits, the carryover 0 is ignored.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3. 29,524 \u00d7 3: 20,000 \u00d73=60,000; 9,000\u00d73=27,000; 500\u00d73=1,500; 20\u00d73=60; 4\u00d73=12. Adding those together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +60=88,560; +12=88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29524.\n\nWait, but according to this formula, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches. a_2=(3^3-1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches Layer 2. a_3=(3^4-1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches Layer3. a_4=(3^5-1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct. a_5=(3^6-1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, correct. a_6=(3^7-1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, correct. a_7=(3^8-1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, correct. a_8=(3^9-1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, correct. a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms it. So, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me try computing it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. This expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 =4. So, when n=1, L_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which can be expressed as 3*(L_9), where L_9 is as above. So, using the formula, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for the recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), leading to the solution \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For 9 layers, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check if I computed each layer correctly because if any layer is wrong, the whole result will be off.\n\nStarting again, maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 \u00d7 3: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 \u00d7 3: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 \u00d73: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 \u00d73: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly because the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...), so each time I add a layer, I go one step out. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... and so on until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3. But perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers of 1+3(...). So, each time, I'm adding another layer. So, in my initial calculation, I did nine layers, ending up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, the original expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can look for a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nLet me define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on, up to L_9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... )))\n\nWhich is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nIn fact, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check if that's the case.\n\nWait, let me test it with n=1: L_1 = 4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Hmm, that's not matching. So, maybe the formula isn't exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = 2*3^{n} -1. Let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: 2*3^1 -1 = 6 -1=5. But L_1 is 4, so that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me think again.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly for each layer. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the formula works for all n up to 9, which it does, as I checked each step. So, that gives me more confidence that my initial computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute each layer using the formula to see if I get the same result.\n\nFor example, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing another layer using the formula and see if it matches my step-by-step computation.\n\nTake n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier calculation of 364. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Which matches my earlier computation. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems reliable. Thus, I can trust that L_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again, just in case I made a multiplication error.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d73=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d73=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I multiply 29524 \u00d73, I can also compute it as:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that's another way to check. 30000 \u00d73=90000, 476 \u00d73=1428. So, 90000 -1428=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n\nSo, nine layers in total. So, n=9 for the outermost layer, which we computed as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, after careful step-by-step computation and verification using both iterative layer-by-layer calculation and a derived formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. Each layer is computed as:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\]\nwith \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\nComputing each layer step by step:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Hmm, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me confirm using another method: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of 3(...):\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the innermost. Each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside:\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3(...) occur? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, nine layers, each computed as above.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute Layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. But I think I might have miscounted the layers because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, the count can be tricky. Let me try another approach: perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer n is defined as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nCompute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with nine layers inside. So, yes, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents.\n\n3^10: Let's compute it step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me just do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar expression)}\\).

The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c=3 and d=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c), provided that c \u2260 1.\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be undefined, but perhaps it's better to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, maybe I should index the layers starting from 0.\n\nLet me redefine: Let a_0 = 1 (the innermost 1 before any 3s). Then, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which would be the 9th layer, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, the innermost layer was a_1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer was a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9, which would correspond to the 9th layer. So, maybe I have 9 layers, so a_9 is the value at the 9th layer, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation, I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 1/(1 - 3).\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_0 = 1.\n\nAt n=0: a_0 = C*3^0 - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 1 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nWait, but earlier I started with a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1, so maybe I should check if my indexing is correct.\n\nWait, in my earlier approach, a_1 was the first layer, which was 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which also matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.

    "text": " Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a recurrence relation. It looks like a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is building up a geometric series. Let me explore that approach. Starting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand each term, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let's try expanding the innermost layers first. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Alternatively, I can express each layer in terms of 3^n. Let me see: a_1 = 4 = (3^2 -1)/2, as before. a_2 =13= (3^3 -1)/2. Similarly, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series\u2014the result is the same. It seems that the problem is designed to test the ability to handle nested expressions and recognize patterns that can be simplified using mathematical formulas. I'm pretty confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. To make sure, I can compute the expression step by step once again, but this time using the formula for each layer. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =4 Layer 2: (3^{3} -1)/2 =26/2=13 Layer3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40 Layer4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121 Layer5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364 Layer6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 Layer7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 Layer8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 Layer9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each addition of 1 and multiplication by 3 adds another term in the series. Since there are nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 would be 3^9 times the innermost 1, but I think I might be mixing up the layers here. Alternatively, considering that each layer adds another power of 3, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which telescopes into a geometric series sum. But regardless, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, that seems consistent. Hmm, but wait a second, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 sections: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let me try to parse it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe each layer is one more set of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to represent this as a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a function. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But let me double-check each step once more to ensure I didn't make a calculation mistake.\n\nStarting with f(1) = 4.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive multiplication.\n\nThe general form is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques for such recursions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say f_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nf(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9 layers, so f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes. The answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define a function \\(f(n)\\) where \\(f(n) = 1 + 3f(n-1)\\) with \\(f(1) = 4\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't miscalculate any of them. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply 29524 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. So, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly. Let me just confirm that each layer is computed correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a linear function of the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see: Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for L_n and then multiply by 3. Let me see: Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer without computing each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, but since I was doing it manually, breaking it down step by step was manageable. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer approach and the formula approach\u2014give the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try that. Suppose a_n = A, a constant. Then, A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

It's interesting how the recurrence relation approach gives a direct formula, avoiding the need to compute each layer individually.

Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if there were more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. The outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the formula. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that all adds up.

But wait, let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can see a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1=4, then n2=1+3*4=13, n3=1+3*13=40, etc. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p +1 => a_p -3a_p=1 => -2a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: a1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9=29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final answer was 88,572, but let me confirm the multiplication again because sometimes I might make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nCalculating 29524 *3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, no carry.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. So that's another way to compute it, and it confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Since each layer is a_n=3*a_{n-1}+1, and we derived that a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) nine times. So, using the formula, it's 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$. We compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5.

So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, each time, I'm multiplying the layer by 3 and then adding 1. But in my calculation, I started from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a9. Then, the total expression is 3*a9. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the calculations, and the closed-form approach confirmed it. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

It's a bit tedious, but since each step only depends on the previous one, it's manageable. I guess the key here was recognizing the pattern and working from the inside out. It's similar to how recursion works in programming, where each function calls another with a simpler input until it reaches the base case. In this problem, each layer is a simpler version of the previous one, ending with the base case of 1 + 3. So, by breaking it down step by step, I was able to handle what initially looked like a complex expression.

Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute that again to confirm: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that makes sense because each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, which is a geometric progression kind of pattern. It's similar to how compound interest works, where each layer depends on the previous one multiplied by a factor. So, in this case, each time we're doing 3*(previous result) + 1. If I were to write this as a formula, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, each Layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is built upon the last. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which gives us the final answer. I think I've covered all the steps correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

I don't think I made any mistakes this time. Each layer built upon the previous one, and I carefully checked each multiplication and addition. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down one step at a time worked well.

Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression starts with 3*(...), so if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count them: 1. After the first 3: (1+3(...\n2. Then another ( inside: (1+3(...\nContinuing until the end. Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, excluding the last one. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" introduces another layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3*(, the first ( is at position 1: (1+3(...). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3*\" introduces a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3*\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers by seeing how many times I can go inward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer is a repetition of 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3*(...\" sections.\n\nLet me write out the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, my initial calculation was correct, with Layer1 to Layer9, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct. Let me verify with a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is right.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute this step by step using my method.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, computing directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) Let's compute:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363.\n\nDirect computation:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*13)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 39)) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases. Therefore, applying the same approach to the original problem, which has 9 layers, should be correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I ended up with 88,572 as the final answer. Let me confirm once more:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to verify the result without computing each layer manually.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for the 9th layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, I can also compute this using the formula without computing each layer.\n\nSince L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as follows:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers.\n\nEach layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\nAs we've derived, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formula aligns with the manual computations. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we determine that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to ensure my pattern is correct. Let's take Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Yeah, so each layer seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, you have 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 - 1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That's pretty cool. It's always good to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can simplify the computation, especially when dealing with nested expressions like this. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Finally, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's check this again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.

    "text": " Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Let me check that calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; then 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 + 9000=88048, 88048 + 524=88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time substituting the previous layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think I did that correctly. Let me just recount the layers to be sure. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. The general form here is a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a closed-form expression, which could be useful for larger numbers of layers. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers, so it's likely correct. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which is the same answer. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form expression. Either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this step by step. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them again. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3(1+3(...)). Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous. Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3) Then Layer 2: (1+3(Layer1)) Then Layer3: (1+3(Layer2)), and so on, until Layer9: (1+3(Layer8)). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I think my earlier computation is correct with 9 layers. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution saved me from computing each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier calculations to see if it works. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Let me just check if there are any alternative ways to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's see. If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, if the terms are converging, but in this case, each term is increasing, so maybe that approach isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's try to unroll the recurrence. L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\nL_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-2}\n...\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_1 = 4\n\nSo, substituting back, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n... and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, it seems that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a linear recurrence. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute L_9 directly without computing each layer. That would have saved time, especially if the number of layers was larger. But since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, just time-consuming and required careful calculation to avoid mistakes. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times I computed the layers. Starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, to see if I get the same result. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. According to the formula, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, if I didn't use the formula, but just recognized the pattern, I could have saved time by computing each layer step by step, but since I already did that, and both methods give the same result, I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but I feel like that might not be correct because when I saw similar problems before, the numbers can sometimes grow exponentially, but 88572 seems quite large. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use to verify this without computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct, matches L_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, my initial computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer \\(L_9\\), this gives \\(L_9 = 29524\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these types of expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. But in this case, since we have 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same answer. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again.
