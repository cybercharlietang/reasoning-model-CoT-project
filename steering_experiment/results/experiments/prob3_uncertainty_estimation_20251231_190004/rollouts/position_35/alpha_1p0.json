Let's go through each layer again to verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Sometimes when I do it step by step, I might add something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n---------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. Each digit multiplied by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3. But let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach time, moving outward, so the number of layers is 9, each starting with 1+3. So, I think my calculation is correct, with Layer 1 being the innermost (1+3)=4, up to Layer 9 being 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Let me check that again. Let me retrace my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,000 is 87,000. Then 3*524 is 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So the total would be 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: Let's break it down. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let's compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, especially in the higher layers. Let me double-check Layer 9: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. That seems correct. Wait, but I feel like that might be a large number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication, it might be right. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to confirm. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, and so on. This looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for this kind of recursion. Let me try to model it. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms the result. The final computation gives:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me check: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, it might be correct.

Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence relation: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the value. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute step by step: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Alternatively, since it's a simple recurrence, I can write out the first few terms and see if there's a pattern. Let's compute L_1 to L_9 as I did before, but perhaps find a formula. L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since the original problem has 9 layers, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found before. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} and so on, but I think the step-by-step computation is sufficient here. Wait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute the expression another way. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand all the layers, maybe it forms a geometric series. Let me try to see: Starting from the innermost layer, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*13) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. But if I try to expand this all the way, I might get a sum of powers of 3. Let me think: Each time, we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to some number of terms. Wait, that might be a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to see how many terms there are. For example, for Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, that's 1 + 3 + 9. For Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, it's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Similarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. So, each layer adds another term in the geometric series with ratio 3. Therefore, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I found earlier. So, for Layer 9, it's the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, if I expand the entire original expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand all the parentheses, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) But this seems too complicated. Instead, using the formula I derived, it's much easier. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost, each layer can be computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. I found a formula for the nth layer as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, that gives (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula holds. Let's take n=1: Layer 1 = 4, formula gives (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2, Layer 2 = 13, formula gives (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3, Layer 3 = 40, formula gives (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me check that. So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Wait, but when I calculated 3*29524 earlier, I got 88,572, which is correct because 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Looking at the layers, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A=0. But in our case, each a_n is finite, so perhaps it's better to solve it step by step without assuming a closed-form. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can expand this recursively: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_{n-3} ... Continuing this pattern, after expanding all the way, we'd get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. If we consider a_0 as 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Then, expanding, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Since a_0 = 1, the expression becomes a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n*1. Wait, let me check that. The sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} is a geometric series with sum (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n*1? Wait, that doesn't seem right because when n=1, a_1 = 4, and plugging in n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 + 3^1 = (3-1)/2 + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: (3^2 -1)/2 + 3^2 = (9-1)/2 + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Formula: (27 -1)/2 + 27 = 26/2 +27=13 +27=40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n. Wait, but that simplifies to a_n = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n -1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds for each layer. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. I broke down the problem by recognizing the nested structure, computed each layer step by step from the inside out, and then used a formula derived from the recurrence relation to confirm the result. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524, correct. So, 3*29524=88572, yes. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or something. Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., which matches what I did before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more efficiently using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me see if that applies here. In our case, k=3 and c=1. So, the formula would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying, a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: (9/2)*3^{0} -1/2= (9/2)*1 -1/2= 9/2 -1/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: (9/2)*3^{1} -1/2= (9/2)*3 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (9/2)*3^2 -1/2= (9/2)*9 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} -1/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=81^2=6561. So, a_9=(9/2)*6561 -1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561=59049, then divided by 2: 59049/2=29524.5. Then subtract 1/2: 29524.5 -0.5=29524, which matches what I got before. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Wait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because the numbers are getting so large so quickly. Let me check 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me compute it another way to confirm. Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for these nested expressions. Let me think about how each layer is built. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, wait, no, wait, the number is 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, let me write it as:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). I computed each layer step by step, verifying each calculation, and ended up with 29524 as the result of the innermost expression, then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check my work by computing a smaller version of the problem and seeing if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, compute a similar expression but with fewer layers, say, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that manually and see if the method gives the same result. Compute step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, compute the expression directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Correct. So, using the same method, I got the right result for a smaller version. Therefore, it's likely correct for the larger problem as well. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the results are used in the subsequent layers. After computing all layers, the final result is multiplied by 3. The step-by-step computation confirms that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524*3. 24*3 is 72, so write down 2 and carry over 7. 524*3 is 1572, plus the carried 7 makes 1579. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm mixing up the digits.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3 is the same as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 88572. Wait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each layer seems to be calculated correctly. Therefore, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, perhaps I should check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(... So, yes, there are 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, so the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly. Layer 8 is 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final result. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say we have a similar expression with fewer layers, say, 2 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*(4) = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. So, the result is 39. Let me compute it step by step: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Now, let's try 3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. So, the result is 120. Let me compute it step by step: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(4))) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for smaller cases. Therefore, I can be confident that for 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

The original expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and building up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step outward. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost part before the final multiplication by 3. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern, because computing each layer step by step might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is when the nonhomogeneous term is zero, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. So, a_9 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049, so a_9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using exponents more directly. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think I'm confident that this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods all lead to the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we determine that \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer \\(a_9\\), this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\).

Hmm, but let me double-check that multiplication to be absolutely sure.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was computing each layer, I assumed that each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). But let me make sure that the original expression is correctly represented by these layers. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count how many times 1+3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, there's a 1+3( and then another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: because the expression has nine sets of 1+3(...). Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) where the innermost is 1+3.\n\n2. Then, the next is 3(1+3(...)) again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers as the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each ... is another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer1), which is Layer 2. Then, Layer3 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), etc., up to Layer9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, my initial approach was correct, and I computed up to Layer9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that there are indeed nine layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of times 1+3 is nested, it's nine times. So, Layer1 to Layer9, each adding another 1+3(...). So, my initial calculation up to Layer9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me try computing the layers again, just in case I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a general formula for expressions of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...(1 + 3)...))). Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, etc., up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. But I think the recurrence approach is clearer here.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, and then verifying with a recurrence relation, I determined that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3: 29524*3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me do it more carefully: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Maybe I should compute each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the values. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, since the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous equation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*841=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the outermost operation is 3*29,524. Let's compute that again: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is defined by that recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might make it easier instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. First, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Next, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, it's like 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's more like a sum of a geometric series but with coefficients. Wait, perhaps not exactly a geometric series, but maybe I can model it as such. Let me think: If I have a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. As before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524 for a_1 to a_9. So, 9 layers. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula I derived: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again, perhaps using a different method or checking the multiplications. Let's go through each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*841=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3*29,524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n24 * 3 = 72.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each additional (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to how many? Let's see the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3) inside:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each time we go out, we add another (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n- The first (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, the next one is (1+3(Layer1)) = Layer2.\n\nThen, (1+3(Layer2)) = Layer3.\n\nContinuing until Layer9, which is the outermost (1+3(...)) before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, meaning a_9 is the innermost expression before the final multiplication. Therefore, a_9 = 29,524, and 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I've checked each step, used a recurrence relation approach, and even thought about whether it's a geometric series, although in the end, the step-by-step computation was sufficient. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems high, but I think it's correct because each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, leading to exponential growth. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again manually without the formula, to cross-verify. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give me the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check another way. 29524*3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24)*3.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost, each ( adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) adds a new layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. ( after 3: Layer1\n2. ( after that: Layer2\n3. ( after that: Layer3\n4. ( after that: Layer4\n5. ( after that: Layer5\n6. ( after that: Layer6\n7. ( after that: Layer7\n8. ( after that: Layer8\n9. ( after that: Layer9\n\nWait, but the expression ends with ))))))), so let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, Layer9 is the outermost, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me write the expression with the layers labeled:\n\nLayer1: 1+3\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1+3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1+3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1+3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1+3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1+3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer7 again. Layer6 is 1093. So, Layer7=1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8=1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the number of layers can be tricky. Let me try to compute the expression step by step, writing down each layer's value to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 88572 seems like a big number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)}=C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier. So, Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so using the recurrence relation approach, I also get 88572. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n=1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I can express a_n as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nFrom the recurrence, a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nExpanding this recursively:\n\na_n=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)))\n\nWhich would be 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, but actually, each a_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nWait, let's see. For n=1, a_1=1+3=4=1 +3^1=4.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3*4=13=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nWait, but 1 +3 +9=13, which is a geometric series sum: (3^2 -1)/(3 -1)= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=m is (r^{m+1} -1)/(r -1). So, if a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, then a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly what we found earlier.\n\nSo, yes, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, which I did earlier, and that also gave me 88572.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can write out the entire expression step by step, expanding each layer:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost expression first: 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly. Each step seems to add up correctly, and using the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression might have only eight layers inside the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses again to make sure. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3: each \"1+3(\" is a layer, so starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parentheses. So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each step out is another layer. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each 1+3(...) adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, it's another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3 followed by another parentheses. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 occurs inside the expression. Let me try to parse it:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms.

Next layer: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)).\nAnd so on, until the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I can see that each time, the number of layers increases by one each time we go out. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen layer 2: 1+3*(layer1).\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(layer2).\n\nAnd so on, until layer9, which would be the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, but when I did the calculation earlier, I ended up with 88572, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check each step again carefully.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original problem starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, so yes, that would be 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSo, a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here. Since the original problem has nine layers, each corresponding to a_n where n=9. So, yes, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series. Since each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, the formula we derived applies.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, the nth term can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut since I already have the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, I can use that to compute a_9 directly, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought that the number of layers was eight, but according to the formula, with n=9, it's correct. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3))\n\nWait, that's nine layers, so n=9. So, the formula applies correctly, giving a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The step-by-step computation seems to check out, so I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nTotal expression:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me double-check Layer9 because that's the outermost layer. Layer8 is 9841, so Layer9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first. 9841*3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So adding up: 3 + 12 =15, carry over 1. 15 +24=39, carry over 3. 39 +27=66. So, 3*9841=29523. Then add 1: 29523 +1=29524. That's correct. Then 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524*3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2=3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So this formula works. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*3^{10}=3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check that again. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, when I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Therefore, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 would be the final result. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply 29524 by 3: 29524 *3. Let's compute it again. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 +60=88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute. Let me check if I correctly accounted for all layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, I computed each layer correctly, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer using the formula to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which is what I got before. Correct. So, the formula is reliable. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined by 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth layer, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Hmm, that seems right, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses inside. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few more layers manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's compute up to layer 5 again using the formula: a_5=(3^{6}-1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364, which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula works, and the step-by-step computation is correct.

That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Okay. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Yep. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's right.

Then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the innermost part, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, yes, Layer 9 is the innermost, and then each layer wraps around it, up to the outermost expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So I think my calculation is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has nine layers, the outermost layer is 3*(L_9). So first, compute L_9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.

Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can check using another method: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost, we have 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote the nth term as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the innermost Layer 1 is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This seems to be a recursive formula, where each term depends on the previous one. It looks like each layer is growing exponentially because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, after 9 layers, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3*29000 = 87000\n3*524 = 1572\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but given how each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's reasonable. Let me just verify my calculations once more to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps using a formula for such recursive expressions. Let me think. The expression inside is of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). This is similar to a geometric series but with a recursive multiplication. Let me see if I can model this with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write the recurrence relation as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n-2*a_p = 1\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = A*3^n + a_p = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, let's compute a_9, since we have 9 layers.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation to confirm the same result. So, I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do this step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. So adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.

Let me think about that. The structure of each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that approach. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f. So it seems this formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in the problem, we have 9 layers. So the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my earlier computation. So the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me verify each step again.\n\n1. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*.\n2. Using the recurrence relation, each layer a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n3. The closed-form solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n4. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n5. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just compute 3^{10} to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me do that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of each layer as a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n -1)/(r -1). But in this case, each term is 1 + 3*sum, which is a bit different. But since we've already derived a closed-form solution, maybe that's the most straightforward way.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So if we start from the innermost layer and work our way out, each step is just 1 + 3*(previous result). So for example, starting with 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, and so on, up to nine layers. I think I did that correctly earlier, so the result should be accurate.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 24*3=72, carry over 7. 2*3=6 +7=13, carry over 1. 5*3=15 +1=16, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the multiplication: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I'm wondering if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution. a_n = C*3^n + D. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equating this to the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtracting 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, the closed-form is indeed a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost as E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. I see a pattern here. Each time, it's adding 3^k where k increases by 1 each layer. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. E2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Etc. So, each E_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but wait, no, because each E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series but with a multiplier. Wait, but the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is similar to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, but scaled. So, perhaps the expression is indeed a geometric series. But since the expression is built recursively, it's better to stick with the recurrence relation solution. So, I think my earlier approach is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the multiplication again: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit. 29,524\n\u00d7         3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. That's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, I just realized that the problem starts with 3(1+3(...)), which is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that's 3*29,524 = 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Then, 59,048 /2 =29,524. Which matches the a_9 we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each a_n using the formula and see if they match the manual computations. a_1: (3^2 -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. a_2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. a_3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. a_4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. a_5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. a_6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. a_7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. a_8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. a_9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, all layers computed via the formula match the manual calculations. Therefore, the final result is indeed 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

But let me check if I can find a formula for a_n. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13.

So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is 29,524. Let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. But let me check again if I computed each layer correctly because sometimes when you have nested expressions, a small mistake can propagate and throw off the entire result. Let me go through each layer once more to be absolutely sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121. Let's compute 3\u00d7120=360 and 3\u00d71=3, so 360 +3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. Let's compute 3\u00d7300=900, 3\u00d760=180, 3\u00d74=12. So, 900 + 180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. Compute 3\u00d71000=3000, 3\u00d790=270, 3\u00d73=9. So, 3000 +270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3\u00d73280. Compute 3\u00d73000=9000, 3\u00d7200=600, 3\u00d780=240. So, 9000 +600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3\u00d79841. Compute 3\u00d79000=27000, 3\u00d7800=2400, 3\u00d740=120, 3\u00d71=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's a different approach. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLet me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D. If a_n = D, then substituting into the equation:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result is computed as 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Let me check: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me think again. When I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So yes, after computing the innermost expression up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get so large so quickly. Let me try computing a couple of layers again to see if the pattern holds. For example, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121. Let me compute Layer 4 again: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4, so plugging n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n dominates unless A=0. But since our sequence is finite, maybe we can find a pattern without solving the recurrence. Alternatively, we can compute each term step by step as we did before, which seems manageable since there are only nine layers. So, going back, after computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer 9 again and then multiply by 3. Layer 8 is 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Correct. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses inside the main 3(...). Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, yes, nine layers. Therefore, my computation up to Layer 9 is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Then, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As I did before, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. This is a recursive expression where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. We can compute up to a_9 and then multiply by 3. Let's compute them again using the recurrence relation: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, same result. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another method or check for any possible miscalculations. Alternatively, I can compute each layer again step by step, but I think I've done that already and got the same result each time. So, unless I made a mistake in the initial steps, which I don't think I did, the answer should be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, so it's a bit different. But maybe I can express it in terms of a geometric progression. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let's denote the innermost expression as x. But wait, actually, since it's nested nine times, maybe I can represent it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me think. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the innermost as layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result again. I think I'm consistently getting 88,572, so that must be the correct answer.

    "text": " Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify that because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it all together: 7 7 8 5 2, which is 77,852? Wait, that doesn't match the previous result. Wait, maybe I did the multiplication wrong. Let me do it again: 29524 * 3: Starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nSo, the result is 7 7 8 5 2, which is 77,852. But earlier, I thought it was 88,572. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me check with another method. Maybe using another approach: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524: \n\n29524 + 20000 = 49524\n\n49524 + 9524 = 59048? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 29524 + 29524: \n\nLet me add the units place: 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write 9, carry 1.\n\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, my initial calculation was correct, and the direct multiplication was wrong because I misaligned the digits. So, the correct total is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me check each step once more. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\n1. Layer 1: 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Layer 2: 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Layer 3: 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Layer 4: 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. Layer 5: 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. Layer 6: 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. Layer 7: 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. Layer 8: 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. Layer 9: 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think I've got it right. There's a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is defined recursively. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that for a moment. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since I've already computed each layer step by step. But just for knowledge, the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, finding a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part, which is a constant. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this, we compute each layer up to the ninth, resulting in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. But I want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of parentheses again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). So the first innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. So, each time, we have a new layer. Let me count them: The innermost is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then moving out, each 1+3(...) adds a new layer. So from the innermost, each step adds a layer. Since the expression starts with 3(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers of 1+3(...). Wait, no, actually, when I started computing, I had Layer 1 as 1+3, then Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9. But perhaps the total number of layers is 9, meaning that the outermost expression is Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But to make sure, let me try computing it step by step again more carefully. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, after verifying using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.

Let's try to find a recurrence relation. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstituting the general solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSimplify:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the general formula is correct. Let me check for n=1: a_1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 =1 + 3*a_1=1 + 12=13. Using the formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=1 +3*13=1+39=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=1+3*40=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I used the formula, a_9 corresponds to the innermost being a_1, and each layer out increases n by 1. So, yes, a_9 is the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. So, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut let me just verify the multiplication once more to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. The key was recognizing the pattern and finding a general formula for each layer, which made the computation much easier instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Using the recurrence relation and solving it gave me a clear path to the solution. I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, that seems correct, but let me verify using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yeah, that's the same result. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the final result. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*(L_9), so 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3.

Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check that again. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So if there are nine sets of parentheses, that would mean nine layers. So Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Let me recompute each layer to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let's do it properly: 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent with the earlier result. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might miscount how many layers there are. Let me check the original expression again to make sure I accounted for all the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" introduces another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n2. Then moving out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2.\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(Layer 2) is Layer 3.\n4. Continuing this way, each time we add another layer by moving outward.\n\nSo, let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the innermost. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections. Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's Layer 1.\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), Layer 2.\n- And so on until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine instances of \"1 + 3(\", which would mean nine layers. So, my earlier calculation of Layer 1 through Layer 9 is correct, with Layer 9 being the outermost. Therefore, the total computation is correct, leading to 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be applied here to compute this more efficiently, especially since each layer is similar. Let me think about whether this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time we have Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me write this as:\n\nLayer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, each layer n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9 (the outermost layer), n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this is correct. I double-checked each step, used a recursive approach, and then even derived a closed-form formula to confirm the result.

Hmm, but let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere. Maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a general formula for L(n). The recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be L(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me assume the particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\nn=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: L(5) = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: L(6)= (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: L(7)= (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: L(8)= (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L(9) = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 step by step to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it properly.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula earlier, let me compute L(9) again using the formula. L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Correct. So, all steps check out.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is one layer, and there are nine of them. So, I think I accounted for all nine layers. Each time, I computed the next layer by plugging in the previous result. So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 step by step: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. Yep, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.
