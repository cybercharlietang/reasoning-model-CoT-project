    "text": " Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, interesting. So, each time, it seems like the value is increasing. Let me try to write this down step by step. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, so Layer 9 is the outermost expression inside the big 3 multiplier. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step. First, 3*20000 = 60000. Then, 3*9000 = 27000. Next, 3*500 = 1500. Then, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait a second, but I just thought, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which in this case is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could express the entire expression using the formula. Since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = (3*59048)/2. Let's compute 59048/2 first, which is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Same result. So, that's a more efficient way, using the recurrence relation to find a formula, and then computing the result without having to manually calculate each layer. I think that's a good approach because if the number of layers were larger, say 100 layers, computing each manually would be impractical, but with the formula, I can compute it directly. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I was able to find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Work Outward Layer by Layer:**\n   - Each subsequent layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)} \\).\n   - Compute each layer step by step:\n     - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n     - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n     - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n     - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n     - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n     - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n     - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n     - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n     - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times \\) the result of Layer 9.\n   - Compute \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and finally the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13, which is 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, all the steps seem correct. Each layer's computation follows logically from the previous one, and I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing.

Let's denote each layer as follows to keep track: Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost one) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, but actually, the problem has nine layers because each time it's 1 + 3(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me check again: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on until we have nine layers. So, actually, it's nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Let me write down each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the total expression would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out to keep track. So, the innermost part is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so maybe Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, with the outermost being 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, I think starting from the innermost Layer 1, which is (1 + 3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me write this out step by step. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, so 2 carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, that's 88,572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step seems manageable. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I've already computed. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. That's a bit quicker, especially if there were more layers, but for nine layers, both methods are feasible. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29,524 \\). Multiplying by the outermost 3, the result is \\( 3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me label each layer to make it easier. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: It's 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 equals 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's verify that. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Then Layer 8 is (1 + 3*(Layer 9 result)), and so on. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough.\n\nNext, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4.

Because the entire expression is 3 times that big parentheses, which is Layer 1. So after computing Layer 1 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.

That's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each step again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here. Let me think.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, which is the result of the innermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Wait, no, actually, in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3*a_1, where a_1 is 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, with a_9 = 1 + 3. So maybe my initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as before.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find a general formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer a_9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this formula because it's a bit surprising that it works so neatly. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second layer from the inside gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first, which is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 40. So, the third layer from the inside is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I go out a layer, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me check if this pattern holds. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, the fourth layer is 121. Continuing this way, the fifth layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, fifth layer is 364. Sixth layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, sixth layer is 1093. Seventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives me 3280. So, seventh layer is 3280. Eighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives me 9841. So, eighth layer is 9841. Now, moving out to the ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives me 29524. So, the ninth layer is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this ninth layer result. So, the expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, layer 1:4, layer2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. Then, multiplying the outermost 3 gives 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Each step was straightforward multiplication and addition, so as long as I did those correctly, the result should be accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested pattern where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, simple enough. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is getting bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each Layer n seems to be following a pattern where each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, the recurrence relation is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just for curiosity, let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see what the first few terms are: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers, they seem familiar. Let me check if they relate to powers of 3. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Hmm, but the a_n terms are much larger. Wait, 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 12 + 1, 40 is 39 + 1, 121 is 120 + 1, 364 is 363 +1, etc. So, each a_n is 1 more than a multiple of 3. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9, which is a9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. That's pretty cool. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. Applying this formula to the outermost layer (n=9), we calculate the final result as 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, it's Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3s. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then moving out, each step is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps I can compute each step step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let me start by evaluating the innermost expression first. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write that as Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: that's 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern for this. Alternatively, I can just compute each layer step by step until I reach the outermost one. Since there are nine layers, I'll need to compute up to Layer 9. Let me list them out step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me do that multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. So:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my Layer 9 computation because that's a crucial step. So, Layer 8 was 9841, correct? Let me recompute Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841). 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing it as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can compute it iteratively, which is what I did earlier. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me see.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, hold on, let me check: when n=1, a_1 =4. So, substituting n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Correct. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times, both by iterative computation and by using the closed-form formula, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Using the closed-form solution for this recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar term)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Evaluate Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer**:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's number them from the inside out for clarity. Let's say:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(result from step 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, in the given expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3(...). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start by evaluating the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, that's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second layer simplifies to 13. Next layer out is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so the third layer is 40. Let me keep going. Fourth layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. Fifth layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Sixth layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364, let me compute that: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Seventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Eighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Ninth layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote the expression starting from the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + 3*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant. In this case, c=1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3*B = 1 => -2*B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is a_1, we have a_1=4. But in our problem, we have nine layers. Wait, let me clarify: Each layer corresponds to a_n where n is the number of layers from the innermost. Since the innermost is a_1, the next is a_2, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, using the formula, I can compute the result without manually stepping through each layer. That's much more efficient, especially if there were more layers. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Compute each layer step by step, which gave me 88,572. 3. Realize that each layer follows a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4. 4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. 5. Since there are nine layers, compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. 6. Multiply by 3 for the outermost layer: 3*29,524 = 88,572. 7. Verified both by step-by-step computation and by the closed-form formula. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me try to break it down step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))) Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). So, starting from there, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing all layers up to Layer 9, we have 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working outwards, the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses is 29524. Therefore, the final step is to multiply this by 3: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840.

So, the inner expression is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which reminds me of geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, I can try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). If I expand it fully, it might resemble a geometric series. Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Let's say I have layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, these numbers are familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121... Wait a minute, these look like the coefficients of 3^n in some expansion. Let me check: 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1. 13 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. 40 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. 121 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Oh, I see! Each layer is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^{n}. So, for layer n, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, but in our case, each layer is built by 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1. The second layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. The third layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, each layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is exactly the formula I derived earlier. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. This reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. If I expand each multiplication, it would result in 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9). Wait, no, actually, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me think: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Then, the next is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds one more term in the geometric series. Therefore, after nine layers, we would have the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method I use\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series\u2014I consistently arrive at the result of 88,572. I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

The sum of the geometric series up to nine layers is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Thus, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.

Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until the outermost layer, which is Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.

Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out for clarity. Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up to the final answer. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me compute that step by step. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify a few layers to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Finally, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, all the layers check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next. After computing all nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then: 1 + 3(result from layer 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSince there are nine layers, I might need to compute each step carefully. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost one.\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3  \nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1)  \nSo that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2)  \nWhich is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 3)  \nThat's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 4)  \nSo, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 5)  \nThat's 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 6)  \nSo, 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 7)  \nThat's 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(result from Layer 8)  \nWhich is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check that multiplication for Layer 9. 3*9841: 9841 times 3. Let me break it down digit by digit:\n\n- 1*3 = 3\n- 4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 8*3 = 24 + 1 (carryover) = 25, carryover 2\n- 9*3 = 27 + 2 (carryover) = 29\n\nSo, writing it out: 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, we go back to the outermost part of the original expression. The entire original expression is 3 multiplied by the result from Layer 9. So, let's compute that:\n\n3 * (result from Layer 9) = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524. Breaking it down:\n\n- 3 * 20000 = 60000\n- 3 * 9000 = 27000\n- 3 * 500 = 1500\n- 3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, no carryover\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524  \n*        3  \n__________  \nMultiply each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7  \n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Then: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Then: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. Let me verify a couple of the layers to be sure.\n\nLet's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000 +2523=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nI think each step is accurate. So, after carefully computing each nested layer, the final result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula that represents this nested expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a recursive expression where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me denote the innermost term as a base case and build up from there.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. Let me let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, computing each a_i:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that method also confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me think about that.\n\nEach term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c))*(c)^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided that c \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, plugging into the formula:\n\na_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nThus,\n\na_n = (a_1 - (-1/2))*(3)^{n-1} + (-1/2)\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4,\n\na_n = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2  \n= (9/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (9/2)*(3)^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9/2 - 1/2) = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (9/2)*(3)^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (9/2)*(3)^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, using this, we can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (9/2)*(3)^{8} - 1/2\n\nFirst, compute 3^8.\n\n3^1 = 3  \n3^2 = 9  \n3^3 = 27  \n3^4 = 81  \n3^5 = 243  \n3^6 = 729  \n3^7 = 2187  \n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, 3^8 = 6561.\n\nThus,\n\na_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2  \n= (9*6561)/2 - 1/2  \n= (59049)/2 - 1/2  \n= (59049 - 1)/2  \n= 59048/2  \n= 29524\n\nWhich matches our previous result. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer: 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524  \n*      3  \n__________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 + 1=7, write down 7  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2  \n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048  \n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks and computations, I'm certain that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break down the computation layer by layer, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. **Next layer (Layer 2):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. **Next layer (Layer 3):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. **Next layer (Layer 4):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. **Next layer (Layer 5):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. **Next layer (Layer 6):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. **Next layer (Layer 7):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. **Next layer (Layer 8):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. **Next layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I might be able to compute it without calculating each layer individually. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula here. The recursive relation seems to be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.  \nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.  \nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.  \nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.  \nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.  \nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.  \nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.  \nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.  \nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step. It's always good to cross-verify using a different method to ensure that the answer is correct. Another way I could think about this is by recognizing that each layer is essentially building up a number in base 3 or something similar, but I think the recursive approach I took is sufficient here. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series if I expand it, but that might get more complicated. Let me try expanding the expression a bit to see if I can recognize a pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and working outward, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would look like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I were to expand this, each multiplication by 3 would distribute over the addition, leading to a sum of terms where each term is 3 raised to a certain power. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to E9.\n\nBut if I think about expanding each layer, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, so when we expand E_n, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_{n-2}. Continuing this way, E_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*E_1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, E_n is a sum of powers of 3 from 0 to n-1 plus 3^n times E_1. Since E_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, that can be written as 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nWait, maybe I can express E_n as a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nE_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*E_1.\n\nBut E_1 is 4, which is 3^1 + 3^0 = 4.\n\nSo, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*(3^1 + 3^0).\n\nSo, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*sum_{k=0}^1 3^k.\n\nWe can compute these sums.\n\nThe sum from k=0 to m of 3^k is (3^{m+1} - 1)/2. So, applying that:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nsum_{k=0}^1 3^k = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n*4.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nE_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n = (3^n - 1 + 8*3^n)/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier, we had a formula for E_n as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check:\n\n(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n}*(3) - 1)/2.\n\nBut in the expansion, I got E_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2, which is the same as (3^{n+2} - 1)/2? Wait, no, 9 is 3^2, so 9*3^n = 3^{n+2}. So, E_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier, when we used the recursive formula, we had E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, no, in the recursive approach, we had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where a_1 was 4. But when expanding E_n, I ended up with E_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2. That suggests that maybe my indexing is off.\n\nWait, in the recursive approach, a_1 corresponds to E_1, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = 4, which is correct. Then, a_2 is (3^3 -1)/2 = 13, which is correct. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in the expansion, I have E_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2. That suggests that perhaps my expansion is shifted by one. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the expansion, I considered E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*(sum_{k=0}^1 3^k). That sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is (3^n - 1)/2, and sum_{k=0}^1 3^k is 4. So, E_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n = (3^n - 1 + 8*3^n)/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{2} * 3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2. But according to the recursive formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, why is there a discrepancy? Let me check for n=1.\n\nFor n=1, E_1 should be 4. Using the expansion formula: (3^{1+2} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Wait, that's not 4. So, something's wrong here. That means my expansion approach is incorrect. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the indices. Let me try again. Let me define E_n as the expression starting from the nth layer. So, E_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 13, and so on. So, in the expansion, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. If I expand E_n, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_{n-2}. Continuing this, E_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}*E_1.\n\nWait, so E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*E_1.\n\nBut E_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*(1 + 3).\n\nTherefore, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n + 3^{n+1}.\n\nBut sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k is (3^n - 1)/2, so E_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n + 3^{n+1}.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nE_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n + 3^{n+1}  \n= (3^n - 1)/2 + (2*3^n)/2 + (2*3^{n+1})/2  \n= [3^n - 1 + 2*3^n + 2*3^{n+1}]/2  \n= [3^n - 1 + 2*3^n + 6*3^n]/2  \n= [ (1 + 2 + 6)*3^n -1 ] / 2  \n= (9*3^n - 1)/2  \n= (3^{n+2} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. But according to the recursive formula, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, which one is correct? Let's test for n=1:\n\nUsing the recursive formula: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nUsing the expansion formula: E_1 = (3^{1+2} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Which is incorrect, since E_1 is 4.\n\nSo, the expansion approach is giving a wrong result here, which suggests that I made a mistake in setting it up. Let me re-examine the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the expansion. Let me try to expand E_n manually for n=2.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nBut according to the expansion formula, E_2 = (3^{2+2} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Which is not 13. So, clearly, the expansion approach is flawed here. Therefore, my earlier expansion was incorrect. Maybe I confused the layers or the indices. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13 = 9 + 3 + 1.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(9 + 3 + 1) = 1 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 40 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1.\n\nWait a minute, that looks like a pattern. Each E_n is a sum of powers of 3 up to 3^{n}.\n\nWait, E1 = 4 = 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nE2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nE3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nSo, in general, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, that sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier recursive formula. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but when I tried expanding E_n as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, I ended up with a different formula. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check the expansion again.\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nIf E_{n-1} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k, then E_n = 1 + 3*(sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Which is correct. So, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, my initial expansion was correct, but when I tried to express E_n in terms of E_1, I messed up the indices. So, the correct formula is E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so:\n\n(177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3  \n3^2 = 9  \n3^3 = 27  \n3^4 = 81  \n3^5 = 243  \n3^6 = 729  \n3^7 = 2187  \n3^8 = 6561  \n3^9 = 19683  \n3^10 = 59049  \n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is 177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divide by 2 gives 88572. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and recognize that each time you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but starting from the innermost term. However, since we have a finite number of layers (9 layers), it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step or use the formula we derived.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous + 1. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times with different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let's label each layer for clarity. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. I'll start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So, Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so let's compute that. Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Hmm, I need to compute 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me break that down. 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) Let me compute each part: 3*20000 = 60000 3*9000 = 27000 3*500 = 1500 3*24 = 72 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the total value of the original expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a linear operation, but compounded multiple times leads to exponential growth. I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Maybe a geometric series or something? Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it's similar to a continued fraction or a continued multiplication. I think in such cases, if the expression repeats infinitely, it converges to a certain value, but here it's finite, with nine layers. So, perhaps each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it more directly. But since I already computed it step by step, it's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me list them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers or in the computations. Let me recount the layers in the original expression. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers? Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time you go out, you add another layer. The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then moving outward, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous expression)). So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from (1+3), each time we add a layer of 1 + 3*(...). So, that would make 9 layers. Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I count the number of layers, I might have miscounted. Let me check the original expression again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each preceding layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer, and there are 9 of them. So, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the computation as I did earlier is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, that's three layers. Let's compute that manually.\n\nCompute innermost first: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that works. So, applying the same method to the original problem should be correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for the innermost layer, which is a_1=4, but in our case, the layers go up to a_9. Wait, in our original problem, the innermost expression is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times and even used a different method (the recurrence relation) to arrive at the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Multiplying the final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nAnswer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me write that down.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 121*3. 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So 300+60+3=363.\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let's do it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be the best way. Let me just compute 29524*3 directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me try again.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3=15.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 29524*3: 29524*2=59048, plus 29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to see if this can be expressed in a different way, perhaps as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let me see if that's feasible.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nLayer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1, with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) = 88572, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I'm satisfied with this solution. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. By computing each subsequent layer, we find that Layer 9 is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that innermost expression. So, the next layer is 3(1 + 3) which is 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12. Wait, no, actually, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3(...)). But since we already computed the innermost as 4, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Wait, hold on, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify: Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + 4). Wait, no, that's not right. Because each layer is 3*(1 + the next inner expression). Wait, maybe I should index these layers. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Layer 4: 3*(1 + layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.

Layer 8: 3*(1 + layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Layer 9: 3*(1 + layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, actually, the entire expression is layer9, which is 36084. Hmm, but let me verify that because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). Let's count the number of \"1+\" sections. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, each time, the structure is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*5 = 15. Layer3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*16 = 48. Layer4: 3*(1 + layer3) = 3*49 = 147. Layer5: 3*(1 + layer4) = 3*148 = 444. Layer6: 3*(1 + layer5) = 3*445 = 1335.

Wait, but let me check: When I did layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. So, the total expression is layer9, which is 36084.

Let me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 36,084. Wait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each \"3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, the first 3 is followed by 1 + 3(...). Then, each subsequent 3 is another layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n2. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n3. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n4. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n5. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n6. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n7. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n8. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each starting with 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, layer1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and layer9 is the outermost. So, my calculation of 36,084 should be correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 36,084. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the solution is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is calculated by multiplying 3 with (1 plus the result of the inner layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let's check. Hmm, maybe I should write each step clearly. Let me try that. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yeah, that's right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, okay, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems like a big number, but let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so total 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of a different way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something like that, since each layer seems to be multiplying by 3 each time. Let me see. If I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let me see if I can express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I expand it all, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, maybe the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let's see, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but this seems to be the same as the original problem. Wait, no, actually, the original problem is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but with 8 layers inside. Alternatively, since I have a formula for a_n, and the outermost layer is a_9, then E = 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which again matches the previous result. So, this gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. I think I've checked it enough ways. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern that can be modeled using a recurrence relation.

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression before the initial 3 is multiplied. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so maybe I should consider that. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 364*3, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total is 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Thus, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me compute that. 3 times 29,000 is 87,000, and 3 times 524 is 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, does that mean the entire expression simplifies to 88,572? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So putting it all together: 88,572. Yep, same result. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built from the previous. So, in this case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 is the innermost, and then we multiply by 3 at the end. Alternatively, if I think of it as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually again. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572. Yep, same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer one by one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost part: (1 + 3). That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Let me note that down: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3: 40 Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121 Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3, so adding those together: 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5: 364 Next, 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6: 1093 Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7: 3280 Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8: 9841 Now, the next layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies down to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. 1+3*13=40. 1+3*40=121. 1+3*121=364. 1+3*364=1093. 1+3*1093=3280. 1+3*3280=9841. 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent each time. I don't see any errors in my steps. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

First, compute the 3 times 4, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3, so adding those together: 300 + 60 = 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364. So, 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093. So, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280. So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841. So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly.\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nCompute from right to left:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we have 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems quite large. Let me verify my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which propagates outward.\n\nLet me recheck each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all layers check out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing each layer as I go.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWhich can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula holds for each layer. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can efficiently compute each layer step by step. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3(4). 3 times 4 is 12. Then, the next layer is 1 + 12, which is 13. Let me write this down step by step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, so each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a recursive sequence or something. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence, say a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer out is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. Substituting a_1, that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each term is built from the previous one. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Alternatively, since this is a linear recurrence relation, maybe I can solve it using that approach. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c is 1 and r is 3. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. I remember that for such linear recursions, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me recall that. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(r - 1)) * r^{n - 1} - c/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, I think it's a_n = (a_1 + c/(r - 1)) * r^{n - 1} - c/(r - 1). Hmm, maybe I should derive it step by step to be sure. Let me write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression only has nine layers, starting from (1+3) up to the outermost 3(...). Let me count the layers again. Each time I go out a layer, I add another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 would be the value of the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, let me clarify that. The entire problem is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested expression. So, the ... part is equal to a_9, so the total value is 3*a_9. So, if I compute a_9, then multiply by 3, I should get the final answer.\n\nBut let me confirm how many layers there are. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses starting from the first one after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3\n\nSo, there are nine opening parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost one is the ninth layer, which is (1 + 3). So, a_1 is 4, as I had before. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_9 would be the value of the innermost expression, but wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost. So, when I compute a_9, that would be the value of the entire nested expression inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the total value is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to a_9, I got 29524. So, 3*a_9 would be 3*29524 = 88572. But let me check that step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go back and compute each a_n step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the innermost expression is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous value plus 1. So, a_9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but maybe it's easier to compute directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the a_n calculations. Let me verify each step:\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, a_9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, the expression can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nIn general, a geometric series has the form S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-1}. But in this case, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n = 1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, the total expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nEither way, the result is the same. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^11 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3 * 59049 = 177147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, 3^11 is indeed 177147, and subtracting 3 gives 177144, which divided by 2 is 88572. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth term and apply it to find the value of the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute innermost layer**: Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n3. **Iterate outward**: For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\n4. **Use recurrence relation**: Recognize the pattern as a linear recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\n5. **Solve the recurrence**: The solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n6. **Compute for n=9**: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n7. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each inner expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s start from the innermost one:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082\n\nAnd so on, up to A\u2089, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression would be 3*A\u2089. That seems manageable. Let me compute each A step by step.\n\nStarting with A\u2081:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving to A\u2082:\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, A\u2082 is 13.\n\nNext, A\u2083:\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep going.\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWhoa, that's a jump. 121. Let's see how this progresses.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWow, okay, it's increasing rapidly. I need to be careful with each step to avoid mistakes.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 1093. That's a prime number, isn't it? Not sure if that's relevant, but just noting it.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3280.

Maybe 99.2 squared? Not sure, but anyway, moving on.\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nAlright, so A\u2089 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089, so let me compute that.\n\nTotal expression = 3 * A\u2089 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, hold on, let me do it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each A step again because I might have made an error in computing one of the A's.

So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this expression as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. But just for my understanding, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this.\n\nLooking at the expression, each A\u2096 is defined as A\u2096 = 1 + 3*A\u2096\u208b\u2081, starting with A\u2081 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\nA\u2096 = 3*A\u2096\u208b\u2081 + 1, with A\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is A\u2096 - 3*A\u2096\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nA\u2096 = C*3^k - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition A\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nA\u2096 = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, A\u2096 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nA\u2081 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=2:\n\nA\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=3:\n\nA\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=4:\n\nA\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=5:\n\nA\u2085 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=6:\n\nA\u2086 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=7:\n\nA\u2087 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=8:\n\nA\u2088 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=9:\n\nA\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the computed values. So, using this formula, we can compute A\u2089 directly without computing all the previous terms. That would save time, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine, it's not too bad either way.\n\nSo, using the formula, A\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, which is similar to the recurrence relation we had before.\n\nBut since we've already solved it using the recurrence and verified it with the formula, I think we're good.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer adds another power of 3. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(something), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*something.\n\nIf I were to expand the entire expression, it would be a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by 1s. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's consider that each time you have 1 + 3*(...), and if you expand all the parentheses, you'd get a sum where each term is 3 raised to a certain power.\n\nFor example, starting from the innermost:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nWait a second, that seems like a geometric series where each term is 3^k.\n\nSo, in general, A\u2096 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{k}\n\nWhich is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^{k}.\n\nThe sum of such a series is (3^{k+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, indeed, each A\u2096 is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{k}.\n\nTherefore, A\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that solidifies the answer even more. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and define each layer as A\u2096.\n\n2. Compute each A\u2096 step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n3. Derive a recurrence relation and solve it using standard techniques for linear recurrences.\n\n4. Verify the formula with computed values to ensure correctness.\n\n5. Alternatively, recognize the pattern as a geometric series and use the sum formula.\n\n6. Compute the final result by multiplying the outermost factor of 3.\n\nThroughout this process, careful step-by-step computation and verification were essential to avoid arithmetic errors, especially with such large numbers. It's easy to make a multiplication mistake when dealing with numbers in the thousands, so double-checking each step helps ensure accuracy.\n\nI think I've covered all bases here. The answer seems consistent across multiple methods, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers, so we define each layer as A\u2081, A\u2082, ..., A\u2089.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - A\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - A\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - A\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - A\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - A\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - A\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Factor:**\n   Multiply the result of A\u2089 by 3:\n   - Total = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse it step by step. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out one layer, it's 3 times that, so 3*(1 + 3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on. So, to make this manageable, I can compute each layer from the inside out. Let me list each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. Let me define each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1)\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n...\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8)\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(L9)\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). So, starting from L1, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 * 500 = 1500.\n\n3 * 20 = 60.\n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nBut actually, it's easier to compute 3 * 29524 directly.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 * 500 = 1500.\n\n3 * 20 = 60.\n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because sometimes breaking it down can lead to errors. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\ntimes 3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\ntimes 3\n\n= 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating L9.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3, a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and proceed to the next. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost, multiplied by 3. Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, maybe I should compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on, until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40: 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so total is 300+60+3=363. Then, adding 1: 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Breaking it down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that looks right. So, I think I did that correctly. Each step follows logically, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations.

    "text": " Let me start from the very inside. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. So, let's compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, and 1 + 39 = 40. So now we have 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, and 1 + 363 = 364. So, 364 is the result here. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(364). Calculating: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, 1093. Another layer out: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me do that: 3*1093 = 3279, and 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, 3280. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3280*3, let me compute that step by step. 3000*3 = 9000, 280*3 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, 29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute that. First, 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that's 88573. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Breaking it down: 80000*3 = 240000, 8000*3 = 24000, 500*3 = 1500, 70*3 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding them together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, that's 265720. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3 = 600000, 60000*3 = 180000, 5000*3 = 15000, 700*3 = 2100, 20*3 = 60. Adding these: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, 780000 + 15000 = 795000, 795000 + 2100 = 797100, 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, 3*265720 = 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. So, that's 797161. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute 3*797161. Breaking it down: 700000*3 = 2100000, 90000*3 = 270000, 7000*3 = 21000, 100*3 = 300, 60*3 = 180, 1*3 = 3. Adding them together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000, 2391000 + 300 = 2391300, 2391300 + 180 = 2391480, 2391480 + 3 = 2391483. So, 3*797161 = 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484. So, that's 2391484. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(2391484). Let me compute 3*2391484. Breaking it down: 2000000*3 = 6000000, 300000*3 = 900000, 90000*3 = 270000, 1000*3 = 3000, 400*3 = 1200, 80*3 = 240, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, 6900000 + 270000 = 7170000, 7170000 + 3000 = 7173000, 7173000 + 1200 = 7174200, 7174200 + 240 = 7174440, 7174440 + 12 = 7174452. So, 3*2391484 = 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453. So, that's 7174453. Now, the last layer is the outermost one: 3*(7174453). Let me compute that. 3*7174453. Breaking it down: 7000000*3 = 21000000, 100000*3 = 300000, 70000*3 = 210000, 4000*3 = 12000, 400*3 = 1200, 50*3 = 150, 3*3 = 9. Adding these together: 21000000 + 300000 = 21300000, 21300000 + 210000 = 21510000, 21510000 + 12000 = 21522000, 21522000 + 1200 = 21523200, 21523200 + 150 = 21523350, 21523350 + 9 = 21523359. So, 3*7174453 = 21523359. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 21,523,359. Wait a minute, that seems like a huge number. Let me check if I did all the multiplications correctly because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Let me go through the steps again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*797161 = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*2391484 = 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\nFinally, 3*7174453 = 21523359.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the multiplications by 3 and additions of 1 seem consistent. So, the final result is 21,523,359. I think that's the answer. It's a big number, but given the repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 over nine layers, it makes sense that the number would grow exponentially. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).

    "text": " Let me number each layer from the inside out to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part. Then the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 = 4. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So 3*364=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So 3*1093=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So 3*3280=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.

So 3*9841=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from E\u2081:\n\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2087 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2089 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. Each computation seems correct. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each step manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each E\u2099 is defined as 1 + 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from E\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E\u2099.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is E\u2099 = a*E\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nE\u2099 = a\u207f * (E\u2080 - c) + c\n\nWhere c is a constant determined by the particular solution. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nBut in this case, since E\u2081 = 4, and the recurrence is E\u2099 = 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, we can solve it as follows.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation E\u2099 - 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E\u2099^h = C*3\u207f.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E\u2099^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, E\u2081=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is E\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nSo, E\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: E\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: E\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: E\u2083 = (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: E\u2084 = (3\u2075 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: E\u2085 = (3\u2076 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: E\u2086 = (3\u2077 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: E\u2087 = (3\u2078 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: E\u2088 = (3\u2079 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: E\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for all the computed values. So, using this formula, E\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29,524, which is what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3E\u2089 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nThis method is much faster and avoids the step-by-step computation, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's good to recognize patterns and apply recurrence relations when possible.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3\u00b9\u2070 manually:\n\n3\u00b9 = 3\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n3\u00b3 = 27\n\n3\u2074 = 81\n\n3\u2075 = 243\n\n3\u2076 = 729\n\n3\u2077 = 2187\n\n3\u2078 = 6561\n\n3\u2079 = 19683\n\n3\u00b9\u2070 = 59049\n\nSo, 3\u00b9\u2070 is indeed 59,049. Therefore, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. It was a bit of work, but breaking it down step by step and then finding a pattern really helped. I guess practice makes perfect, and recognizing these kinds of structures will make solving similar problems easier in the future.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the next layer. By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression and work outward.\n2. Recognize the pattern as a recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula.\n3. Apply the formula to find the value of the entire expression.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12. Then, we add 1 to that result, so the next layer becomes 1 + 12. Let me write that down: 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, so each time, we take the result from the inner layer, multiply it by 3, add 1, and then move outward. Let me try to formalize this. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost layer and L9 is the outermost. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4. L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times (all those layers). So, after computing the innermost layers up to L9, which gives 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again just to be sure.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 is definitely 4.\n\nL2: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nNo more digits, so carryover 2 would be 20000? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I should compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, perhaps I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, a closed-form solution is derived, confirming the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So I need to multiply 29524 by 3.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...)), then each subsequent (1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer 3\n...\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Each time, it's nested inside another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layer computations.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3) terms.\n\nInnermost: (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. So the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(...)) where the ... is 8 more layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of (1+3) expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write down the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1+3*(Layer8))\n\nBut the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So yes, 9 layers, each computed as above.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial expression again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's (1+3). Then each next layer is (1+3*(...)). So the number of layers is 9, as each (1+3) is a new layer, starting from 1 and going up to 9.\n\nSo, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can write this recurrence relation as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let me try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can plug in the initial condition to find A and B. Let's see:\n\nFor n = 1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nFor n = 2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we can set up two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nNow, plugging A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying that, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 =27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, L_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer using the recurrence relation and confirm the numbers again.\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let's label each layer for clarity. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Wait, actually, since the entire expression is 3*(...), that might be Layer 9, but let's confirm. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count: 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. Let's see: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Then Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I need to compute up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer's value. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading the digits from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 *3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524. Let's compute 29524 +29524: 29524*2=59048. Then 59048 +29524: Let's add 59048 +20000=79048, +9524=79048+9524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check each layer's computation to be sure. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the inner expression. So, yes, after computing up to Layer9, which is the innermost expression, and then multiplying by 3, we get 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. We need to compute up to a_9, then multiply by 3. Alternatively, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A =1 +3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the expression as a geometric series, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But in this case, since it's a linear recurrence, the closed-form is more straightforward. Either way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me number the parentheses to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is the 9th layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3 Then, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) And so on, up to Layer 1: 3*(Layer 2) Hmm, wait, actually, the entire expression is 3 times something. So maybe the outermost operation is 3*(...), and inside that is the first layer. Let me try to write each layer step by step. Let's start from the innermost layer, which is Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 4, Layer 8 becomes: Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so Layer 7: 1 + 39 = 40. Okay, moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 6: 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, this is growing exponentially, I think. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step: 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 4: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So Layer 3: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, Layer 2: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 1: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 1 is 29523. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 3*9841 = 29523. Correct. So, all the layers check out. I think I did this correctly. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time worked well. I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, you always solve the innermost one first and work your way outward. This problem is a good example of that principle. Each time, I computed the value inside the parentheses and substituted it into the next layer. It was helpful to number each layer to keep track of where I was in the process. I also noticed that each layer's value was significantly increasing because each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric progression or something similar, but since it's nested, it's more like repeated multiplication. If I were to generalize this, it might resemble a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is dependent on the previous one, it's more of a recursive computation. Anyway, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the final value of 29523. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me verify the final multiplication: 3*9841. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Yep, that's correct.
