    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. So perhaps it's better to think of each step as computing a value and then multiplying by 3 for the next step. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNow, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. So Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So that's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nContinuing this way, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 364 times 3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then plus 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then plus 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then plus 1 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 can be broken into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n3*20000 = 60000  \n3*9000 = 27000  \n3*500 = 1500  \n3*20 = 60  \n3*4 = 12  \n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572  \n\nSo 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As before, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Hmm, maybe it is correct after all. But just to be thorough, perhaps I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrences. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1)*(r)^{n - 1} when r \u2260 1. Wait, but in our case, r = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would still apply, but the terms will grow exponentially.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe it's easier to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nSo, as computed earlier, a_9 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nExpanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion, we can write a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0, where a_0 would be the initial term before a_1.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 is defined as 1 + 3 = 4, so perhaps a_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, maybe we can consider a_1 as the first term, so the expansion would be up to a certain number of terms.\n\nWait, but perhaps this approach is complicating things. Since each term is built upon the previous one, and we only have nine layers, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step as I did before, especially since the numbers get large quickly, but it's manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe that's not the correct formula.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p  \nWhich leads to a_p - 3*a_p = 1  \n-2*a_p = 1  \na_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4  \nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to write each step separately. Let me denote the innermost part first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Let me write this down step by step. Let me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, looking back, I think there are nine layers because each opening parenthesis adds a layer, but let me count again to be sure. Starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each step out adds another (1+3*(...)). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1). Then layer3: 1+3*(layer2). And so on, up to layer9, which is the outermost. So, maybe I should compute layer1 to layer9 step by step. Let me try that approach. Let me create a list where each element is the result of each layer. So, layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer2 = 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer3 = 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer4 = 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer5 = 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer6 = 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer7 = 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer8 = 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer9 = 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(layer9). Because the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing layer9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, final answer = 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let me do this step by step. 3 * 20000 = 60000. 3 * 9000 = 27000. 3 * 500 = 1500. 3 * 24 = 72. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, reading the digits from the end: 2,7,5,8,2,8,5,7,2,8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should give a 6-digit number. Wait, perhaps I should do it more carefully.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carry over 0 doesn't matter. So the result is 88572. That matches my earlier calculation. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layer calculations. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each subsequent layer's value and use it to compute the next. After calculating the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that sounds manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer, and since each layer's value is significantly larger than the previous one, the numbers get big pretty quickly. It's like a geometric progression, maybe? Let me think about that for a second. If each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe that's overcomplicating it for this problem. Since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but if there were more layers, it might be useful to find a closed-form formula. However, since nine layers are manageable, I think my step-by-step approach is sufficient here. So, to recap, I started with the innermost parentheses, computed each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next expression, and finally multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer. This seems logical and methodical, and I don't see any errors in my calculations upon reviewing them. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute that:\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nCompute from right to left:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nLet me verify that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nYes, because 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10\n\n9 + 9 = 18\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, 59048.\n\nThen add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2 +1=8.\n\nNo more digits, so carryover 1.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n59048\n\n+29524\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nThen the next digit: 5 + nothing=5.\n\nWait, but 59048 is a 5-digit number, and 29524 is also 5-digit, so:\n\n5 9 0 4 8\n\n+2 9 5 2 4\n\n= ?\n\nStarting from units:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a layer. Let me go back through each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This seems similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, up to a_9.\n\nI can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D. If the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = D.\n\nThen D = 1 + 3*D.\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and using a formula for the linear recurrence, we find that each layer follows a pattern.

Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me clarify. The expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous result). Let me write this down as a sequence. Let's define each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost. So, S1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Wait, but the original expression is 3*(S9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested part. So, the total result would be 3*S9. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from S1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. S2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Correct. S8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. S9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can write a general formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let's think about it. Each step is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting from S1 = 4. So, S2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, S3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for S_n. The recurrence is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is S_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition S1 = 4. So, when n=1, S1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, S9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*S9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(S9), where S9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, so the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nThen, next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting a different result. So, maybe I need to count how many layers there are.\n\nWait, let's see the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3s after each 1 +.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is 1 layer, then each subsequent layer adds another. So, the number of layers is 8, because the expression starts with 3*(1 + 3*(...)) and there are 8 more 3s inside.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\nSo, let's count the number of layers.\n\nEach time we have a 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because when I count the layers, I get 9 layers, but the original expression seems to have 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, let's count how many times we have 3*(1 + ...):\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 8 layers inside. So, does that mean there are 8 layers after the initial 3? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\n- Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n- ...\n- Up to Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8)\n\nWait, but the original expression has 8 sets of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after each 1 +.\n\nWait, let's parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's list them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so if I start from the innermost and work outward, I end up with 9 layers, but the original expression seems to have 8 layers after the initial 3. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me try to write the expression with placeholders:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So:\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So:\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 8 layers inside. So, does that mean that Layer 9 is the outermost, and the total expression is Layer 9? Or is it Layer 8? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times 3*(1 + ... occurs after the initial 3*(...).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3*(1 + ..., there are 8 more 3*(1 + ... expressions. So, that would mean 8 layers after the initial one, making a total of 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 3*(1 + Layer8) = 36084.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 36084. But let me verify this because it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined recursively as:\n\nL(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1))\n\nwith L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nFirst, let's write down the first few terms to see the pattern:\n\nL(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nNow, to find a closed-form formula for L(n), let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nL(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)), with L(1) = 4.\n\nLet me expand the first few terms:\n\nL(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3 times 1, but wait, let me see:\n\nWait, L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nSo, L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 3\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve this using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1)\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n\n-2*A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, L(1) = 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3*C\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3*C\n\nSo, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n\n\nWe can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to leave it as is.\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2:\n\nL(n) = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2) = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n(11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n(11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147, correct.\n\nn=5:\n\n(11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\nL(9) = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nSo, L(9) = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = 19683*10 + 19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nThen, 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n216504 / 6 = 36084\n\nSo, L(9) = 36084, which matches my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Since the original expression has 8 layers inside the initial 3*(1 + ...), does that mean n=8? Wait, no, because each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we apply the 3*(1 + ...) operation. Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...), so the total number of layers is 9, corresponding to n=9 in the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{36084}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to work from the inside out. Let's denote each layer as follows: Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Let me try that approach. Let's define L1 as (1 + 3). Then L2 would be 1 + 3*L1. L3 would be 1 + 3*L2, and so on until L9, which would be the outermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). That seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 * 500 = 1500.\n\n3 * 20 = 60.\n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524 should be 88572. Let me verify that multiplication another way.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So the final result is 88572. But let me check if I computed each L correctly.\n\nLet me recast the layers:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is built correctly. Therefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n... and so on until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I started with L1 as (1 + 3), which is the innermost, and built up to L9, which is the outermost. So, yes, that's correct. Each L corresponds to a layer, and there are nine layers in total. So, computing up to L9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can compute this using the formula without having to compute each layer. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSimplify that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049 *3 = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By defining each layer recursively and using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. The outermost layer, when multiplied by 3, results in the final value.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of 1 + 3(...), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Define layers**: Let each layer be a_n, where a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\n3. **Compute each layer**:\n   - a_1 = 4\n   - a_2 = 13\n   - a_3 = 40\n   - a_4 = 121\n   - a_5 = 364\n   - a_6 = 1093\n   - a_7 = 3280\n   - a_8 = 9841\n   - a_9 = 29524\n\n4. **Final computation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's try to start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that might be a good approach. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me start by computing Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break this down to make it easier. 3*29524 can be thought of as 3*(29000 + 524). So, 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Now, add those two results together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's the right approach. I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step. Each layer was 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, which made the numbers grow quite quickly. By the time I got to Layer 9, the number was already 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gave me the final result. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but it's always good to verify each step, especially with such large numbers. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to work backwards. Let's start by looking at the innermost part first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple enough: 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that result. Wait, no. Let me see. The innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer becomes 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I think I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me write this down step by step. Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9. Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost is layer 9, and the outermost is layer 1. Wait, no, maybe I should number them from the inside out, starting at 1. Let me try that. So, layer 1 is the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again because I'm a bit confused about how many layers there are. The original expression is 3 times a big expression, which itself is 1 + 3 times another expression, and so on, nine times. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) sections. Let me see: The first is 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count them: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) instances. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3(...), so layers 2 through 9. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1 + 3(...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. So, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times I see (1 + 3(...)): Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, moving out, each time I see another (1 + 3(...)), that's another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Then, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. But in the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the first (1 + 3(...)), which itself has 8 more layers inside. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 1.\n\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 2.\n\n- This continues until Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no. The outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is the result of the innermost expression, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I have 9 layers, and the final result is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation, I had Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each time, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer adds one more 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, that's 1 + 3, then moving out, each time another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. So, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is 9 layers deep. Wait, no. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) sections.\n\nEach time I see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times do we see \"1 + 3(\" in the expression?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have \"1 + 3(\", and that continues until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many \"1 + 3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, that means there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me write out the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression, which itself is 1 + 3*(...). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that is the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure my approach is correct. Let's take a smaller version of the problem, say, with only two layers.\n\nSuppose the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, computing directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich matches. So, my approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the original problem, which has 9 layers inside, I get 88,572 as the final result.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the smaller test cases worked out, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3\u00d729524 = 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, with the outermost being multiplied by 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) Wait, no, actually, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). So, starting from Layer 1, which is the innermost, it's just 1 + 3, right? Wait, no, because Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). But Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), and so on. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, because that's the last part before the first closing parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost: Let's count the number of layers. Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count: starting from the end, there are nine instances of 1 + 3(...). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost. So, L9 = 1 + 3(1 + 3) ? Wait, no, because L9 is just 1 + 3, because there are no more layers inside it. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me start from the innermost and work my way out. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the last part before the first closing parenthesis. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). So, 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me check that. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait a minute, that seems correct so far. Let me continue:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that: 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4+4=8\n\n2+2=4\n\n5+5=10, write down 0, carry over 1\n\n9+9=18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\n\n2+2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 59048.\n\nNow add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8+4=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4+2=6 +1=7.\n\n0+5=5.\n\n9+9=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5+2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me make sure that's correct.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer9, I thought it was the innermost, but actually, each layer is built by the previous one. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the end:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so if there are nine layers, each time adding another 1+3(...), then Layer1 is the innermost (1+3), Layer2 is the next one out, up to Layer9 being the outermost before the initial 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I miscounted the layers because the initial expression has nine 1+3(...) terms, each nested inside the previous one. Let me count again:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another expression in parentheses. Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears, excluding the outermost 3 multiplier.\n\nLooking at it:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, a new ( starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there's a (1+3(, then another (1+3(, and so on, until the ninth (1+3(...)). So, actually, there are nine layers, each with 1+3(...). So, my initial approach was correct, computing up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed nine. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Each time I see a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let's count from the inside:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers. Therefore, my calculation up to Layer9 as 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the Layer9 calculation. Let me recompute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression from the innermost layer step by step, writing down each layer's result.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 being the innermost. Wait, but actually, in this case, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost as a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, a_1 was the innermost, which is 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A =1 \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier result. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_i \\) where \\( L_9 \\) is the innermost layer.

    "text": " Let's try to parse this from the inside out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So now, that layer simplifies to 13. Next layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(40). So, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, okay, so that's 121. Let me write this down step by step to keep track. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression only has eight sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me check that again. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds one more. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3( inside that\n3. So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me see: Each time I have \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each step out adds another layer. So in the original problem, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each additional \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as how many times we apply 1 + 3*(...). Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is built as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me confirm. Let's see the structure:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and so on, down to Layer 1 being (1 + 3).\n\nWait, but if I have 9 layers, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute each layer up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again, step by step, writing each layer carefully.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 30,000*3 - 476*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first started, I thought there were 9 layers, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3( inside that\n3. Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a new \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each time we go out, another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I computed earlier, because the innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds a layer, and the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps my initial calculation is correct, resulting in 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a pattern or formula here instead of computing each layer manually, because if there are more layers, this method might be tedious.\n\nI notice that each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1))\n\nWith Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nWe have Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)).\n\nLet me write the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer (n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Layer n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nLayer 1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So yes, Layer 9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of times 3 is multiplied, which is 9 times, but I think the layer count is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula can help me compute it without manually calculating each layer.\n\nWait, but I think I've already confirmed it with both methods: step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. Both give me Layer 9 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that innermost expression. Let me write it down step by step, starting from the inside. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the outermost layer is 3 times (something). So, maybe I need to adjust for that. Let me try to write each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \nAnd so on, until Layer 9, and then multiply the entire thing by 3.\n\nWait, but actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire inner expression. So, if I denote each inner expression as starting from the innermost, then I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost parentheses first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(innermost) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous layer) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. Each time I add a layer, I'm going one step further out. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I started, I computed up to 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, which would be the 9th layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that 9th layer. So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted correctly. Let me count the number of times I have 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of layers.\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 1 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)  \n2. (1 + 3*(1))  \n3. (1 + 3*(2))  \n... up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

(1 + 3*(8))  \n\nThen, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the 9th layer.\n\nSo, I think I have 9 layers inside, each one being 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8  \nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n--------  \nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1  \n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8  \nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers and their computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nYes, that's 9 layers. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time we have Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nThe general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nLayer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1, with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1  \nC - 3C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition Layer 1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2  \n4 = 3A - 1/2  \nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A  \n9/2 = 3A  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nLayer 1 = (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6 = (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7 = (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8 = (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start, but since I was unsure, I did it step by step, which also worked. It's good to verify using both methods.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach Layer n can be expressed as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nBut since we've already derived the formula, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we find that Layer 9 is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to simplify the innermost part first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(innermost part). Since the innermost part is 4, this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous layer). The previous layer is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Hmm, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here or if I can find a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me write down the terms step by step to see if I can spot a pattern or compute them one by one. Starting with a_1 = 4. Then:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression only has nine layers, right? Let me count again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, and then each layer outwards is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous. So, 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such a nested expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let me compute a_5 using the formula: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my previous computation. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that the value of the original expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me try to compute each level starting from Level 1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 360*3 is 1080, and 4*3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240, so 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3(Level 9) = 3*29524.

Let me note down each step:\n\n- L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n- L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n- L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n- L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n- L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (L9). So, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Since L9 is 29524, then the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 29524 * 3:\n  - 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n  - 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n  - 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n  - 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n  - 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n  - So, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify using another method. Let me break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3*(29524) = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each layer. Let me go through each L1 to L9 again to confirm.\n\nStarting over:\n\n- L1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n- L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n- L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n- L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n- L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n- L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n- L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n- L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n- L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (as computed earlier). So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I did that correctly, each time taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and proceeding outward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me see. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, let's model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value at the nth layer, starting from L1 as the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1.\n\nIn general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, L9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572, as computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*L9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with the exponents. Let me compute 3^10 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11}=3*59049=177147.\n\nThen, 177147 -3=177144.\n\nDivide by 2: 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think again about the expression. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let S be the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut actually, in this case, the inner expression is only 9 layers deep, so it's a finite nested expression. So, it's not an infinite series, but a finite one. Therefore, the formula I used earlier applies.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me consider the expression as a sum. Each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps expanding the entire expression would help.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since I've already calculated each layer step by step and confirmed with the formula, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try expanding the expression a bit to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLet me write the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1's and 3's. Each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, each layer adds another 1 and another 3.\n\nBut perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, we get L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLooking at the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWhich is (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 3's. Wait, but in our case, each layer adds another 3. Let me see, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach I took earlier.\n\nAnother way to check is to compute the expression using a calculator, but since I don't have one handy, I can compute each step again to confirm.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\n1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, all steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, starting from 1 and going up to 3^9, but since it's a finite series, the sum would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me think: Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so expanding it, we get:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to expand this expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, maybe this approach is too convoluted. Let me stick with the earlier method.\n\nIn any case, all my calculations point to the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the ninth layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal expression: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse it step by step. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses are the last one: (1 + 3). So, that's the first step. Let me compute that: (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be: 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, substituting the value I just got, it's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that's the next layer. Now, moving out another layer, the next parentheses would be: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, substituting 13, it's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I go out a layer, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Wait a second, that seems like a pattern. Let me see if I can formalize this. Let's denote each layer as a term a_n, where n is the number of layers from the innermost. So, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Continuing this way, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yes. Then, a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, a_5 = 364. Then, a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, a_6 = 1093. Next, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, a_7 = 3280. Moving on, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, a_8 = 9841. Finally, a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524. Now, wait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(a_9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is a_1, and each layer out is a_n, so the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but given the number of layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might be correct. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, so each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for linear recurrence relations of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1. Let me see if I can apply that formula. But wait, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In our case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c=3, d=1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0)*c^n + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But wait, in our case, the initial condition is a_1 = 4. Let me check: when n=1, a_1 = 4. Using the formula, a_n = (a_0)*3^n + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But I need to find a_0 such that when n=1, a_1=4. Let me set n=1: a_1 = a_0*3^1 + (3^1 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. We know that a_1=4, so 3*a_0 + 1 = 4 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = 3^n * 1 + (3^n - 1)/2 = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Let me combine the terms: 3^n + (3^n)/2 - 1/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more terms using the formula to confirm. Let's take n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which matches my earlier calculation. n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula seems solid. Therefore, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we find that the nth term can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

If I can find a general formula for a_n, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each a_n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our original problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of times the expression 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), and so on. Each time we add another layer. Let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, then each layer adds another a_n. Since the innermost is a_1, then the next is a_2, and so on. How many a_n terms are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's a_1. Then each subsequent layer adds another a_n. So, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost. Wait, let me count: The innermost is (1+3), that's the first. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is a_1, then a_2, a_3, up to a_9? Because the original expression is 3*(...), and inside, the first term is 1 + 3*(...), which is a_2. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. Let me write it out with indices to see how many layers there are. Let me define the innermost as layer 1: layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 = a_1. Then, layer2: (1 + 3*layer1) = a_2 = 13. Layer3: (1 + 3*layer2) = a_3 = 40. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is layer9: (1 + 3*layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*layer9. So, total layers are 9, from a_1 to a_9, and the final result is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems like a big number, but let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+\"s in the expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3*(...), and inside, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), that's a new layer. Let me see: The first layer is (1 + 3). Then, each time we go out, we have another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, as the expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Therefore, a_1 is the innermost, a_9 is the outermost, and the total expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I calculated before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check this calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^10 is indeed 59049, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 *3. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step manually, just to be thorough, to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the formula. Let's try computing each layer from a_1 to a_9 manually, just to confirm. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=1+39=40. a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +3*40=1+120=121. a_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +3*121=1+363=364. a_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. a_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. a_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. a_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them: 1. (1+3) - that's a_1. 2. (1+3(a_1)) - a_2. 3. (1+3(a_2)) - a_3. 4. (1+3(a_3)) - a_4. 5. (1+3(a_4)) - a_5. 6. (1+3(a_5)) - a_6. 7. (1+3(a_6)) - a_7. 8. (1+3(a_7)) - a_8. 9. (1+3(a_8)) - a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 is the outermost layer, and the total is 3*a_9=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since I've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it step by step, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By defining each layer recursively and solving the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer builds on the previous one, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next nested term)}\\).\n\n2. **Define Recursive Layers:**\n   - Let \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n   - Each subsequent layer \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   - The recurrence \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\) is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence.\n   - The solution is found to be \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Layers:**\n   - The expression has 9 nested layers, so we need \\(a_9\\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\(a_9\\):**\n   - \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29,524\\).\n\n6. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   - The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\).\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's check: The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, that seems manageable. Then, L3 would be 1 + 3*(L2). So, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, is that right? 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nSo, starting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3*(L9). So, once I compute L9, which is 29524, then the total value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me calculate that step by step. 29524*3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500*3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20*3 = 60\n\nAnd finally, 4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each step multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, each layer is following the formula L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nI can also think of this as a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nLet me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Alternatively, using the general formula, the total expression can be expressed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define each layer \\(L_n\\) where \\(L_1\\) is the innermost expression.

    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))) Hmm, wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The innermost is (1 + 3), so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(innermost). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me write this down systematically. Let me define each layer as a step. Let's denote each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost. So:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times S9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is S9. So, after computing S9, we have to multiply it by 3. So, the final result would be 3 * S9 = 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, then subtract (476 * 3) because 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Okay, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing S9. Let me go back through each step again.\n\nStarting from S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(S9), where S9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I might have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each step manually, which could be error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a form of a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nSo, the nth term is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by step-by-step computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me check with n=3.\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct as per my earlier step-by-step. So, the formula works.\n\nThus, using the formula, a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. So, I feel confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to use a recurrence relation. \n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each subsequent layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). This follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n3. **General Solution**: The nth term of this recurrence is found to be a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n4. **Compute a_9**: For nine layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n5. **Final Expression**: Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to start from the very inside. The innermost expression is (1 + 3), right? So that's 1 plus 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write this down step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, L1 is the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out one layer, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, L3 would be 1 + 3*L2. L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me continue this process. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Okay, moving on. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, L9 would be 1 + 3*L8. Let's compute that. 3*9841. Hmm, let's break this down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times L9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each step again quickly. Starting from the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive relation. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let's consider the general form of each layer: each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's find a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since the step-by-step expansion worked well. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I think of it as digits in base 3, maybe each layer adds a digit. Let me test that idea. If I have a number in base 3, say d_k d_{k-1} ... d_1, then its value is d_k*3^{k} + d_{k-1}*3^{k-1} + ... + d_1*3^1 + d_0*3^0. But in our case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4 in base 10, but in base 3, that's 11 (since 1*3 + 1 = 4). Then, the next term is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which in base 3 is 111 (1*9 + 1*3 + 1 = 13). Similarly, the next term is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which in base 3 is 1111 (1*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 + 1 = 40). Wait a minute, this seems to form a pattern where each term corresponds to a number with n+1 ones in base 3. So, for example, a_1 = 4 = 11_3, a_2 = 13 = 111_3, a_3 = 40 = 1111_3, and so on. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is consistent with what I found earlier. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me try to parse it from the inside out. Let's denote each nested part as a separate expression to make it clearer. Let me define E1 as the innermost expression and work my way outwards. So, starting from the innermost part: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, the next layer out would be E2 = 1 + 3*E1 Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression. Then, the entire problem is 3*E9. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try to compute each E step by step.\n\nStarting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3.

That matches my earlier calculation. Okay, so the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the E computations.\n\nStarting over:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(E9). So, in my initial breakdown, I considered E9 as the outermost expression, which is correct because each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, yes, the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about it. The structure of the expression is a geometric series, perhaps. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I let E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4, then each subsequent E is built upon the previous one. So, solving this recursively, we can see that each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for E_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut let me check: The homogeneous solution is found by solving E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation first, then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form E_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, E1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each E_n, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have E9 as the outermost expression. So, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, E9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same result, which reinforces that our initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_{n-2}, and so on, until we reach E1=4.\n\nSo, expanding E9, for example, would give us a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, actually, let's think about it.\n\nIf E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, then expanding E_n gives 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_{n-2}, and so on, until we reach E1=4. So, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * E0, but wait, E0 isn't defined here. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't as straightforward.\n\nWait, in our case, E1=4, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, E1 = 1 + 3*1, but actually, in the problem, the innermost expression is E1=1+3, so E1=4, then E2=1 + 3*E1=1 + 12=13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to recognize that each E_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier. So, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just verify once more by computing E9 again using the formula.\n\nE9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute 3*29524 in another way to confirm.\n\nCompute 29524*3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard multiplication method:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n-------\n   88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying through multiple methods\u2014both step-by-step expansion and using the recurrence relation\u2014I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me try to parse it step by step. Let's start from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that: 3(4) = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer becomes 13. Next layer out is 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that: 3(13) = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so now we have 40. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Wait, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. So, maybe I can represent this as a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me try to write down the terms as I compute them. Let's define a sequence a_n where n is the number of layers. Wait, actually, in this problem, each layer is an additional multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check my calculations because this seems like it's growing very quickly, and I might be making an error in multiplication or addition. Let me go through each step carefully again. Starting with a_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. a_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. a_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, earlier I wrote 1 + 3*40 = 121, but 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is indeed 121. Correct. a_5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 = 360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. a_6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. a_7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. a_8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. a_9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, after computing each layer, the innermost is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524. So, that means the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous result plus 1, leading up to 29524 at the ninth layer. Now, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times this ninth layer. So, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me verify this multiplication because I might have made an error in adding the partial products. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: Starting from the rightmost digit: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus the carryover 1 is 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27, plus the carryover 1 is 28. Write down 8 and carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus the carryover 2 is 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. So, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sequence of a_n. Because each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. That seems correct. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series or something, but since each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, that's a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is a_9=29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and I've verified each step carefully. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

    "text": " Let me try to work from the inside out. Let's start by labeling each layer to make it easier. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outwards, Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since there's nothing inside the innermost parentheses except 1 + 3) Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost parentheses are (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start by computing Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Well, 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just verify each step quickly to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result, which might save time and confirm my earlier computation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 that I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it step by step again, just in case I missed a layer or miscalculated somewhere. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524. Layer 10: The outermost 3*(29524) = 88572? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hold on. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original problem again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...). Then, each time we have another (1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections. 1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...). Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Each time we have a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\" inside the expression. So, that means there are 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9 result). So, 3*29524. Wait, but earlier I thought that was 88572, but then I thought the final result was 265,719. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let's count the number of closing parentheses at the end. It ends with ...1+3))))))).\n\nSo, how many closing parentheses are there? Let's see: Starting from the end, after the last 1+3, there are 8 closing parentheses. Wait, let me check:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting from the end: The last part is (1+3)))))))). So, after the last 1+3, there are 8 closing parentheses. That suggests there are 9 layers because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3), layer 2 is (1 + 3*(layer1)), up to layer9, which is (1 + 3*(layer8)). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, let me recast this:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought it was 265,719. Hmm, so perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my initial calculation, I went up to layer9 as 29524, and then the final step was 3*29524 = 88572, not 265,719. So, where did I go wrong earlier? Let me see. When I first started, I thought there were 10 layers, but now I'm seeing that it's 9 layers, which would result in 88572. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier, thinking there were more. Let me confirm.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: There are 9 opening parentheses: each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. So, layers 1 through 9, each adding another (1 + 3*(...)). So, that would mean that after layer9, we have 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. Therefore, my initial calculation was wrong because I thought there were 10 layers, but it's actually 9. So, the correct final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. ...1 + 3(\n3. ...1 + 3(\n4. ...1 + 3(\n5. ...1 + 3(\n6. ...1 + 3(\n7. ...1 + 3(\n8. ...1 + 3(\n9. ...1 + 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Each of these is a new (1 + 3(...)). So, layer1 is (1 + 3), layer2 is (1 + 3*(layer1)), up to layer9, which is (1 + 3*(layer8)). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). Therefore, layer9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, my initial calculation was incorrect because I thought there were 10 layers, but it's actually 9, leading to 88,572 as the final result. Wait, but let me double-check the layers again to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nLet me write out the layers step by step with their results:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was thinking there were 10 layers, but it's actually 9, so the final result is 88,572. But let me check the original problem again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer. Since there are 9 sets of (1+3(...), that means 9 layers. So, the final result is 88,572. Therefore, my initial calculation of 265,719 was incorrect because I thought there were more layers. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure again. Let me try to compute it again step by step, just to be absolutely certain.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29,524). Let me compute that: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265,719, which was a mistake because I miscounted the layers. So, to summarize, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursion. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this problem, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive expression where each term is defined as 1 + 3*term(n-1). Let me define term(n) = 1 + 3*term(n-1), with term(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, term(1) = 4.\n\nterm(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nterm(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nterm(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to term(9).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*term(9).\n\nSo, using this recursive formula, we can compute each term step by step, which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for term(n). Let me try to derive that.\n\nThe recursive relation is term(n) = 1 + 3*term(n-1), with term(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is term(n) = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: term(n) - 3*term(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant solution C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is term(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, term(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is term(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: term(n) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, term(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms.\n\nFor n=1: term(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: term(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: term(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, term(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, term(9) = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*term(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result, confirming that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I initially made a mistake by miscounting the layers, but upon reviewing and using a different approach with the recurrence relation, I arrived at the correct answer. It's a good reminder to double-check work, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be easy to miscount.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute back into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue substituting each layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me try to parse the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost part. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so that layer becomes 40. I'm starting to see a pattern here. Let me try to write down each step systematically. Let's define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost one:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, which is the innermost, it's 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(4) = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(13) = 40, and so on. So, I think I can continue this process until I get to Layer 9, which will be the outermost one, and then multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times the first Layer 1, which itself is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on. So, perhaps I need to compute up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3. Wait, no, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1), but Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*(13) = 40, but that doesn't seem right because when I did Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 as 13, and so on, the outermost Layer 9 was 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check the original problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each followed by 1 + 3(...). So, that means there are nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, let's call it Layer 9: 1 + 3. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 9 first, it's 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 1 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524*3. Let me compute that step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Wait, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 88,572. But let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Let me go through each layer step by step again: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29,524 as 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. Let me add them up: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and working outward, I end up with the final result of 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer step by step.

    "text": " Let me try to parse it step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. But wait, no, that's not quite right because each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me correct that. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, so the next layer is 13. Then, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40.

Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nWait, let me check that again because 3*13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, moving on. The next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Hmm, interesting. Let's go another layer out: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, getting larger each time. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Then, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Now, how many layers have I processed so far? Let me count:\n\n1. 4\n2. 13\n3. 40\n4. 121\n5. 364\n6. 1093\n7. 3280\n8. 9841\n\nWait, that's eight layers. But the original problem has nine layers because I see nine sets of parentheses. Let me confirm that. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each layer adds another set. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. ...\nUp to nine layers. Wait, in my previous calculation, I went up to 9841, which was the 8th layer. So, I think I missed one layer. Let me recount:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = ?\n\nWait, so the 9th layer is (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute that. 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let me do this step by step. 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n24 * 3 = 72.\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. (1 + 3*1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. (1 + 3*3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. (1 + 3*9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count again. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2))\n...\nUp to Layer9: (1 + 3*(Layer8))\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so in my previous calculation, I had 9 layers inside, each adding another (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost 3* that.\n\nWait, but when I started, I thought the innermost was Layer1: (1 + 3) =4\n\nThen Layer2: (1 + 3*4)=13\n\nLayer3: (1 +3*13)=40\n\nLayer4: (1 +3*40)=121\n\nLayer5: (1 +3*121)=364\n\nLayer6: (1 +3*364)=1,093\n\nLayer7: (1 +3*1,093)=3,280\n\nLayer8: (1 +3*3,280)=9,841\n\nLayer9: (1 +3*9,841)=29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29,524)=88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, both methods, step by step calculation and using the recurrence relation, give the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process for each layer up to the ninth layer, we find the ninth layer's value to be 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer).\n3. Calculate each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 13\n   - Layer 3: 40\n   - Layer 4: 121\n   - Layer 5: 364\n   - Layer 6: 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 29,524\n4. Multiply the ninth layer's result by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that layer is 40. Wait, let me check that again. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yep, that's correct. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that layer is 121. Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. So far, I have:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, that seems like each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, and so on. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me think about how this sequence progresses. It seems like each term is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence relation. I think the solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_1 is 4, so maybe I should adjust the indices accordingly. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to compute a few more terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\na_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\na_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\na_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\na_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\na_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\na_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\na_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, there are nine layers, so I think I need to compute up to a_9. Let me check: the innermost is a_1 = 4, then each layer out adds one more a_n. So, the outermost layer would be a_9. Let me confirm that. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a_n, so the first layer is a_1, then the next is a_2, up to a_9. So, I need to compute a_9. From the above computations, I have up to a_9 = 29524. Hmm, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recalculate each step carefully:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so that seems correct. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost expression, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, but then the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. Wait, no, let me see: the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, if a_9 is the result of the innermost expression, then the total value is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I included that 3*... as part of each a_n. Let me clarify: perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. But then the entire expression is 3*a_9, right? Because the outermost term is 3*(a_9). So, if a_9 is 29524, then the total value would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4. Then each layer out adds a 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the first layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until the ninth layer. So, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each ( is a new layer.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nSo, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3\n\nWait, so from the outermost 3, each \"(\" adds a new layer, so there are 9 layers in total. So, the innermost is layer 9, which is (1+3) = 4. Then layer 8 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer 7 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to layer 1, which is the outermost, which is 1 + 3*(result of layer 2). But wait, no, the outermost is 3*(result of layer 1). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nEach time I have a \"(\", it's a new layer. So, the first layer is the innermost (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the outermost operation is 3*(layer 9). So, the total value is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this because I might have miscounted the layers. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the value for each layer, and then finally multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, if I denote the innermost expression as x, then each layer out adds another 1 + 3x, where x is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I compute the innermost part as 4, then each layer out is 1 + 3*(previous), up to the ninth layer, and then multiply that by 3. So, if the ninth layer is 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me recompute each step:\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), but the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe I need to adjust the count. Let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1+3) = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until the ninth layer, which would be a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that the number of layers is actually one fewer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3 is eight, which would make nine layers in total. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, maybe the solution is a geometric progression. The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If a_1 = 4, then according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's test for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have nine layers, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^{10}=59049. Then, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. So, a_9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 3^k for k from 0 to n, but perhaps there's a way to express it that way.\n\nWait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, it's more like a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series but with a constant term added each time. So, the formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expression as starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and after nine layers, the total is a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've checked it enough times, and all the steps add up correctly. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step. Let me define each layer as follows: Let me start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer is built using the previous one. Let me try to write this out: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. But actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524*3 in another way to verify. Let's compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572, which matches my previous calculation. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*(4) equals 12. Then, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 12. That would be 13. Then, moving out another layer, it's 3*13, which is 39. Then, adding 1 gives us 40. Hmm, so maybe each layer is following a pattern where each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, no, actually, each step is adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, (1 + 3) = 4. Then, 3*(4) = 12. Then, (1 + 12) = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Then, (1 + 39) = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Then, (1 + 120) = 121. Then, 3*121 = 363. Then, (1 + 363) = 364. Then, 3*364 = 1092. Then, (1 + 1092) = 1093. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*1093, which would be 3279. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me try again more methodically. Maybe I should number each layer from the inside out. Let's say there are 9 layers because each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, and I can count them: 1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n10. 3*(364) = 1092\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. 3*(1093) = 3279\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: each \"1 + 3(\" adds one, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first term is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), so that's the first inner expression. Each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) which is layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(4) = 12, then (1 + 12) = 13, which is layer 2.\n3. Then, 3*13 = 39, then (1 + 39) = 40, layer 3.\n4. Then, 3*40 = 120, (1 + 120) = 121, layer 4.\n5. 3*121 = 363, (1 + 363) = 364, layer 5.\n6. 3*364 = 1092, (1 + 1092) = 1093, layer 6.\n7. 3*1093 = 3279, (1 + 3279) = 3280, layer 7.\n8. 3*3280 = 9840, (1 + 9840) = 9841, layer 8.\n9. 3*9841 = 29523, (1 + 29523) = 29524, layer 9.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because I'm getting a different result. Did I miscount the layers? Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should write each step explicitly, starting from the innermost and moving outward, keeping track of each result.\n\nLet me list each step with the corresponding result:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12. Then, (1 + 12) = 13\n3. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39. Then, (1 + 39) = 40\n4. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120. Then, (1 + 120) = 121\n5. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363. Then, (1 + 363) = 364\n6. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092. Then, (1 + 1092) = 1093\n7. Next layer: 3*(1093) = 3279. Then, (1 + 3279) = 3280\n8. Next layer: 3*(3280) = 9840. Then, (1 + 9840) = 9841\n9. Next layer: 3*(9841) = 29523. Then, (1 + 29523) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems way too big, and I'm not sure if I'm correctly counting the layers. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each nested expression as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1, but actually, the structure is that each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, perhaps each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. From the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4=12; then 1 + 12=13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer2) = 3*13=39; then 1 + 39=40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer3)=3*40=120; 1 + 120=121\n\nLayer5: 3*121=363; 1 + 363=364\n\nLayer6: 3*364=1092; 1 + 1092=1093\n\nLayer7: 3*1093=3279; 1 + 3279=3280\n\nLayer8: 3*3280=9840; 1 + 9840=9841\n\nLayer9: 3*9841=29523; 1 + 29523=29524\n\nLayer10: 3*29524=88572; 1 + 88572=88573\n\nWait, but the original problem only has 9 layers of nesting, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" corresponds to an opening parenthesis, so from the first 3( to the last ), how many times does \"3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after a 3, there's a \"(\", so let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"3(\", meaning 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, when I calculated up to layer 9, I got a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but when I was counting earlier, I thought I had 10 layers, but now I see it's 9 layers. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I thought there were 10 layers, but it's actually 9.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers correctly. Each \"3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( adds another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" occurrences, which is 9. Therefore, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the computation should be done up to layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(result of layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to a_10, which would be layer 10, but that's incorrect because there are only 9 layers. So, let's correct that.\n\nLet me start over with the correct number of layers.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4=12; then 1 + 12=13\n\nLayer3: 3*(Layer2) = 3*13=39; then 1 + 39=40\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3)=3*40=120; 1 + 120=121\n\nLayer5: 3*121=363; 1 + 363=364\n\nLayer6: 3*364=1092; 1 + 1092=1093\n\nLayer7: 3*1093=3279; 1 + 3279=3280\n\nLayer8: 3*3280=9840; 1 + 9840=9841\n\nLayer9: 3*9841=29523; 1 + 29523=29524\n\nSo, after layer9, we have 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 Total so far: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 Total: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers, so the final result is 88572. Let me check this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me verify each layer's computation:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression seems to follow a pattern where each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by:\n\na_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^n - 1) + (a_0*(r - 1))/(r - 1)\n\nWait, actually, more accurately, the solution is a_n = A*r^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when the nonhomogeneous term is zero: a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Let me compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a sum where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut in any case, the step-by-step computation seems solid, and the formula also leads to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " Let me try to parse the expression. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the inner layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me write down each step as I go along. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let me break it down. 3*29000 = 87000. Then, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, is the final answer 88572? Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression had nine sets of parentheses, so nine layers. Let me count: Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's L1, then each subsequent layer adds another L. So, L1 to L9, which is nine layers. So, I think I accounted for all nine layers correctly. Each time, I computed the next layer by taking 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1, L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, L3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4, L4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a way to write the entire expression as a geometric series or something. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me try to represent this as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. But I already solved it by computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation. Maybe another approach is to recognize that each layer adds another power of 3. Let me think. Let me try to write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me expand it a bit. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me compute the innermost part first, as I did before, but perhaps I can see a telescoping pattern or something. Alternatively, since I have the formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so E = 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same answer as before. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula for the recurrence relation. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we compute the result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

    "text": " Let me try to parse it step by step. Let's denote each inner expression as a separate term. Let me start from the innermost one and work my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? So, let's compute that first. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(Level 1). So, Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Level 2 is 13. Next, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(Level 2). Level 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Level 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. Level 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, this is growing exponentially, I think. Level 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's huge. Level 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, wait, so that's the innermost part working out to 29524? But hold on, let me check because I might have miscounted the levels. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's level 1, and then each subsequent level adds another layer. So, if I have nine levels, then the outermost layer is 3*(Level 9). Let me make sure I didn't skip any levels or miscount. Let me recount the levels:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine levels. So, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9. Now, after computing level 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is the level 9 expression, which is 29524. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have messed up the carryover.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524: 29524 \u00d7 2 = 59048.\n\nThen, adding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Yep, same result. So, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier levels. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step and throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me recompute each level step by step to verify:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each level manually. Let me think about that. Each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. So that's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each level, which is more efficient, especially if the number of levels were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only nine levels, both methods work. However, recognizing the pattern and finding the closed-form formula is a powerful approach because it allows solving for any number of levels without manually computing each step.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The given expression is a nested multiplication where each level is 1 + 3*(previous level).\n- There are nine such levels, starting from (1 + 3) at the innermost.\n- Each level can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n- Solving the recurrence relation gives a formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n- For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n- The entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recursive pattern. Each level is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the previous term.\n2. **Compute each level** from the innermost outwards up to the ninth level.\n3. **Use the recurrence relation** to find the ninth term: \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).\n4. **Multiply by 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

So, if I compute each layer starting from Layer 1 and moving outward, I can substitute each result into the next layer. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.

Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the original problem is 3*(...). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any errors along the way. Let me go through each layer again quickly to see if I missed anything. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Wait, each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as Layer 1 was 4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as Layer 2 was 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) =4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 +3*(4)=13. Next layer:1 +3*(13)=40. Next:1 +3*(40)=121. Then:1 +3*(121)=364. Next:1 +3*(364)=1093. Then:1 +3*(1093)=3280. Next:1 +3*(3280)=9841. Then:1 +3*(9841)=29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern of a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous term})\\). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let's see, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, let's compute that step by step. Let me try to outline each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of layers. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I count correctly, each step I took above should correspond to each layer. Let me recount the layers to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems right. Each step corresponds to each set of parentheses, and after nine layers, we get to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3:\n\n- 20000*3=60000\n- 9000*3=27000\n- 500*3=1500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, starting from the innermost, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer is a new set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, the first \"1 + 3(\" is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times the pattern \"1 + 3(\" appears, excluding the outermost 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's nine layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, each layer is one step. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct, with nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 4, and then the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like it might form a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think the general solution for such a relation can be found.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have nine layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when I computed step by step up to layer 9. So, that's consistent.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution gives me the same result as computing each layer step by step. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more of a linear recurrence rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nAnother way to think about it is expanding the entire expression. Let me try that, although it might get messy.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define E_1 = 1 + 3\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\n...\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*E_9.\n\nSo, E_1 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E_9 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the entire expression without parentheses and see if I can compute it directly, but that might be error-prone.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, again, same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem and see if the pattern holds.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute this step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: For n=3 layers inside the outermost 3(...), E_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Then, 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3*13=39. Using the formula: E_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Then 3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller n, which gives me more confidence.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to building a number in base 3, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, from the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is similar to a geometric series sum.\n\nIndeed, (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^n, but adjusted by the recurrence relation.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it. Since we already have the formula and verified it with smaller cases, I think it's safe to proceed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value at each stage. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the value at the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to break it down step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(that innermost expression). So, it would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.

Hmm, this seems to be getting larger each time. Let me keep going. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. Next, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, now we're at 364. Continuing, 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, now we're at 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3*3280. Well, 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(that result). So, 3*88573. Let me compute that: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, the final result is 265719. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do a lot of multiplications, I might slip up. Let me go through each step again quickly. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Next, 1+3*13=40. Then, 1+3*40=121. Next, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Next, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. Next, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 1+3*29524=88573. Finally, 3*88573=265719. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I added 1 and then multiplied by 3, except for the very first step where I just added 1 and 3. So, each layer is built upon the previous one, and each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 265719. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something. Because each layer is similar, it might be a geometric progression. Let's see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each term as a_n, where n is the number of layers, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. But I also need another condition to solve for A and B, but since the recurrence is non-homogeneous, perhaps I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. Alternatively, I can recognize that this is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me try to unroll the recurrence. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_{n-2} So, substituting back: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, after k substitutions: a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k} + 3^{k+1}*a_{n - (k+1)}. When k = n - 1, then a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} * a_1. But a_1 is 4, so: a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/ (3 - 1) + 3^{n} *4. Wait, hold on, the sum of a geometric series from 0 to m is (3^{m+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1). Wait, let me double-check that. The sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k} is equal to (3^{k+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, for a_n, we have the sum up to 3^{n-1}, which is (3^{n} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n} *4. Let me compute that: (3^n -1)/2 + 4*3^n = (3^n -1 + 8*3^n)/2 = (9*3^n -1)/2. So, a_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 would be (9*3^9 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^9 is 19683. So, 9*19683 is 177147. Then, 177147 -1 is 177146. Divided by 2 is 88573. So, a_9 is 88573, which matches what I got earlier when I computed step by step. Then, the final result is 3*a_9, which is 3*88573. As before, that's 265719. So, this method gives me the same answer, which is reassuring. I think that confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. So, the final answer is 265719.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Next Layer:**\n    \\[\n    1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n    \\]\n\n11. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 88573 = 265719\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{265719}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to count the number of layers. Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) ... and so on until the ninth layer. Wait, actually, maybe I miscounted. Let me try again. Each time, I see a 1 + 3 followed by another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: the innermost is 1 + 3. Then moving out, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps each layer is built upon the previous one. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to define each layer as a variable or something, but since I don't have that luxury here, I can just compute each step one by one. Let me try to compute from the inside out. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(that result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so the next layer is 40. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me write this down step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nLet me number each layer from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we then multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify the layers again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount how many layers there are in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are 9 layers. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each time we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3: that's layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(layer 1): that's layer 2.\n- Then, layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2).\n- This continues until layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(layer 9). So, if layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed layer 9, I assumed that each layer is built upon the previous one, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is calculated correctly. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check again. Sometimes, when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count how many times the pattern (1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, in total, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- After the initial 3, the first ( is for the first 1 + 3(...).\n- Then, inside that, another ( for the next 1 + 3(...).\n- This continues until the ninth (.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3.\n2. Then, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers.\n\nWait, but actually, each time we add a layer, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in total, there are 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to layer 9, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check again, perhaps by writing out the entire expression with the computed layers.\n\nLet me try to write the expression with the computed layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each layer is computed correctly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are computed correctly. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(layer 9), but when I computed layer 9, I included the 1 + 3*(layer 8). So, layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8), which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is 4, but let me see:\n\nWait, in my earlier computation, layer 1 was 4, which is 1 + 3. Then layer 2 was 13, which is 1 + 3*4. So, yes, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nBut let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. It's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^n*(a_0 - c/(1 - r)).\n\nWait, but let me check that formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^n*(a_0) + c*( (r^n - 1)/(r - 1) )\n\nWait, let me verify that. Let me recall that for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant if c is a constant.\n\nAssuming a particular solution a_p, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = r*a_p + c \u2192 a_p - r*a_p = c \u2192 a_p*(1 - r) = c \u2192 a_p = c/(1 - r).\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_0 to find A. Let's say a_0 is the value when n=0. But in our case, a_1 is 4, so let me adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the layers starting at n=1, where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstitute a_n = A*3^n + d:\n\nA*3^n + d = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + d) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3d = 1 + A*3^n + 3d.\n\nNow, equate coefficients:\n\nA*3^n + d = 1 + A*3^n + 3d.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nd = 1 + 3d.\n\nThen, d - 3d = 1 \u2192 -2d = 1 \u2192 d = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make any miscalculations in the formula.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{10} first, which is 59049, then compute (59049 -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost term. By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, we find that the value of the innermost term is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, which is derived from the linear recurrence relation, we determine that the ninth layer equals 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's try that. Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a good approach. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. So, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. I think that's the right answer. So, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, right? Wait, no, the innermost part is actually the last (1 + 3). Let me see: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous expression. Hmm, perhaps I can represent each layer as a term and compute them step by step. Let me assign each layer a variable to make it clearer. Let's say: Let\u2019s denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. Let me define a1, a2, a3, ..., a9, where each a_i corresponds to the expression starting from the innermost. So, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*a9. Hmm, that might work. Let me try computing each a_i step by step.\n\nStarting with a1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so a9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each a_i. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\na1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\na2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\na3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\na4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\na5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\na6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each term step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach a_i is defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_i. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_i = A*3^{i} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that. Let's suppose a_i = A*3^i + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence: a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}.\n\nSo, A*3^i + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{i-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{i-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^i + 3B.\n\nSo, the equation becomes: A*3^i + B = 1 + A*3^i + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^i from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When i=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each i, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values to see if it holds.\n\nFor i=1: a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor i=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor i=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try expanding the expression without using the formula, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute from the innermost (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nNext:1 + 3*40=1+120=121.\n\nNext:1 + 3*121=1+363=364.\n\nNext:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if there's a geometric series involved here. Since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it might be related to a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me think about the entire expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) and so on, nine times. So, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is like a geometric series with ratio 3, but starting from 1 and each term being multiplied by 3.\n\nBut in this case, it's more like a finite geometric series because it's nested nine times. So, maybe the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series applies here.\n\nWait, the standard formula for a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. So, it's more like a linear recurrence than a simple geometric series.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. So, for i=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems to be consistent. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by expanding the entire expression. Although that might be time-consuming, maybe I can try.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40.\n\nNext:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nNext:1 + 3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about this as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. The step-by-step computation seems straightforward enough.\n\nWait, another thought: since each a_i is (3^{i+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a9 would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_i \\) where each term is built by the previous one.

Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12.

So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572.

    "text": " Let me try to break it down step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we have 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. That would be 3*40, which is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, so now we're at 364. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364. Let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, now we have 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, now we're at 9841. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, now we have 88573. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, that's 265720. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161. So, now we're at 797161. Finally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 3*(previous result). So, 3*797161. Let me compute that. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding them all up: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 3*797161 is 2391483. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2391483. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a very large number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any of the multiplications or additions. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161. Correct. Finally, 3*797161 = 2391483. Hmm, all the steps check out. So, despite the large number, it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote the innermost expression as a base case and see if I can find a pattern. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*a_9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = A - 1/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got a_9 as 797161. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, no, maybe I confused the indices. Wait, let's see. Wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, if we start from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on, up to a_9. So, in the recurrence, a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1. Therefore, the expression we have is 3*a_9. So, according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2391483. That's way larger. So, clearly, there's a mistake in my approach. Let me figure out where I went wrong. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is one, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, the number of layers is actually 9. Wait, but when I used the formula, a_9 gave me 29524, and 3*a_9 was 88572, but when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2391483. So, which one is correct? Let me recount the layers in the original problem. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times (1+3(...)) occurs. Starting from the first 3(1+3(...)): that's one. Then, inside that, another 3(1+3(...)): that's two. Continuing, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses: each (1+3(...)) is a new layer. Wait, actually, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), etc. So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, so n=9. So, according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2391483. So, which one is correct? Let me check my step-by-step computation again. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me go through the step-by-step again, but this time, I'll keep track of how many layers I'm processing. Starting with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. That's layer 1. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 2. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 3. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 4. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 5. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 6. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 7. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 8. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Layer 9. Then, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait a minute! So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I was computing step by step. I went beyond layer 9, which was incorrect. The original expression has nine layers, so after layer 9, which gives a_9 = 29524, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. But earlier, when I was computing step by step, I continued beyond layer 9, which was incorrect. I think I miscounted the layers and went too far, which led me to an incorrect result. So, the correct computation should stop at layer 9, giving 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. Let me verify this with the formula again. The formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for n layers, starting from n=0. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. I must have made a mistake earlier when I was computing step by step, probably miscounting the number of layers and continuing beyond the ninth layer. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we find the result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
