    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple. Now Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, let me break it down more accurately. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. For example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Each subsequent layer is calculated correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 at the end gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems like a plan. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Let me check Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. So, it's like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me confirm with Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. So far, so good. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check one of the layers again to be sure. Let's take Layer 5: 3*Layer 4 is 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, adding 1: 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Let me try the next layer to see if this pattern continues. The next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, 121 is the next result. Let me check the next one: 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363, then adding 1 gives 364. So, 364 is the result here. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3 is 1092, then adding 1 gives 1093. So, 1093 is the next result. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, then adding 1 gives 3280. So, 3280 is the result here. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3280*3 is 9840, then adding 1 gives 9841. So, 9841 is the next result. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9841*3 is 29523, then adding 1 gives 29524. So, 29524 is the next layer. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, then adding 1 gives 88573. So, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, I need to compute 3*88573. Let me do that: 88573*3. I'll compute it step by step. 80,000*3 = 240,000. 8,000*3 = 24,000. 500*3 = 1,500. 70*3 = 210. 3*3 = 9. Now, adding all those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500. 265,500 + 210 = 265,710. 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3*88,573 = 265,719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was computed as 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on. I went through each layer step by step, and each time I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. Then, at the end, I took that final result and multiplied it by 3. Let me verify the final multiplication: 88,573 * 3. Breaking it down: 80,000*3 = 240,000; 8,000*3 = 24,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 70*3 = 210; 3*3 = 9.

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since it's the innermost, there's nothing inside the parentheses beyond that) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.

So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me go back through each layer quickly to see if I made any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, carryover 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be increasing exponentially, so the final number being over 88,000 seems plausible, but just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nWait, this expression resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as I did before, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, so layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways now, so I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from 1 to 9, starting with the innermost layer:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)  \n...  \nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)  \nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, when I look again, the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous layer. So, it's like a recursive expression where each layer depends on the previous one. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 is 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3*Layer 4. 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 29524*3 step by step:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7        3  \n________  \nLet's multiply each digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.  \nThere are no more digits, so write down the carry over 2.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier because that's a lot of steps. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4  \nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13  \nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40  \nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121  \nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364  \nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093  \nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280  \nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841  \nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524  \nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent each time. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since I don't see it immediately, I think my step-by-step approach is solid. Each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer, so it's a geometric progression or something similar. But since I already computed each layer, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me start by numbering each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost layer is Layer 1, and then each layer moving outward is Layer 2, Layer 3, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times a new layer. So maybe the innermost is Layer 1, and then each next layer is built upon that. Let me count the number of layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then the next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, but in the problem, I see nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them. Let's see: starting from the first '(', that's one, then another, so two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So yes, there are nine layers. So, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3 at the end, right? Wait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I should compute Layer 1, then use that to compute Layer 2, and so on, until Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3. Let me try that approach. So, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's see, 30,000*3 is 90,000, but 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. So 3*29524 = 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 3*476. What's 3*476? 3*400=1200, 3*76=228, so total 1200+228=1428. So 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Therefore, the result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify my steps because this seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524). Let's compute that again. 29,524 * 3. Let's compute step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. Maybe using the fact that 30,000 *3=90,000, so 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 3*476.\n\nCompute 3*476: 400*3=1,200; 70*3=210; 6*3=18. So 1,200 +210=1,410 +18=1,428.\n\nSo 90,000 -1,428=88,572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me recount the layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each set of parentheses adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of '3(' sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does the (1 + 3(...) occur? Let me parse it:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each time we have a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nEach '3(' introduces a new layer, so starting from the innermost, there's 1 + 3, which is one layer. Then each subsequent '3(' adds another layer. Let me count the number of '3(' after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 8 more '3(' inside. Wait, let me see:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3( is followed by 1 + 3(...). Inside that, another 3(, and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen moving outward, each '3(' adds a new layer:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: because the expression has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count the number of parentheses. Each ( adds a layer, but each ) closes it. Let me count the number of '(':\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first '(', that's one, then each subsequent '(', so:\n\n1: ( after 3(\n\n2: ( after 3( in the next layer\n\n3: ( after 3(\n\n...\n\nContinuing, I think there are 9 layers, as I initially thought. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed as I did before.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step checks out. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost parenthesis, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 9. Then the next one is (1 + 3*(Layer 9)), which would be Layer 8, and so on, until the outermost Layer 1, which is multiplied by 3. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. Now, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 8 is 13. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 7 is 40. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 6 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 4 is 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 3 is 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 2 is 9841. Finally, Layer 1: 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 1 is 29523. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 1: 3*9841. Let's compute that again: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Correct. Hmm, seems like all the layers check out. So, the final result is 29523. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the numbers seem to add up correctly. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. By systematically evaluating each layer, we find that the entire expression simplifies to 29523.\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3))\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4))\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5))\n7.

So, the outermost operation is multiplying the result of the ninth layer by 3. So, I'll compute each layer from 1 to 9, each time plugging the result into the next layer.

Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or make an error in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. If it were more layers, maybe a formula would be better, but for nine, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nWait, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer. Maybe I can recognize this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute it directly, for n=9, the innermost expression is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nEither way, the result is the same. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's call the innermost part Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost), and so on. So, maybe I should compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until I reach Layer 9. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 result is 13.\n\nNow, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 result is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 result is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 result is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9 result). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer adds a multiplication by 3 and adds 1. So, each time, it's like a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me consider the general form: Let\u2019s say we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for each layer, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then the particular solution.\n\nThe general form is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D by setting a_n = D, so D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Hmm, that's a negative fraction, which seems odd because all our a_n values are positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to this is a_n = (a_0 + 1/2)*(3^n) - 1/2. Let me check that.\n\nWait, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Using the formula: (a_0 + 1/2)*3^1 - 1/2. Let me see what a_0 would be. If n=0, a_0 would be the innermost value before the first multiplication, which is 1. So, a_0 =1.\n\nThen, a_1 = (1 + 1/2)*3 - 1/2 = (3/2)*3 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (1 + 1/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (3/2)*9 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (1 + 1/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nIf n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more because I want to be absolutely sure. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 =59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3:29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1 +3*(previous result). So, the formula gives us a way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For 9 layers, this results in 29,524.

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but since it's the innermost, does it just end there? Wait, no, because each layer is part of the next. Let me think. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on. Let me try that approach. So, let's start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. Let's define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out, it's 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Compute 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Continuing outward, 1 + 3*(result from Step 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4). 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Moving outward, 1 + 3*(result from Step 5). 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6). 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Continuing outward, 1 + 3*(result from Step 7). 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Now, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8). 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, writing it out:\n\n9841  \n\u00d7     3  \n-------  \n29523 (since 1*3=3, 4*3=12, carryover 1; 8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2; 9*3=27 +2=29, carryover 2; and then the carryover 2 becomes the next digit, making it 29523). \n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But remember, the original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n--------  \n88572 (since 4*3=12, write down 2 and carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, write down 5 and carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; so the result is 88572).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that. Because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me check a couple of the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88,572. Let me confirm that multiplication again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n--------  \nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step, I believe the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to see if I get the same result. Sometimes, when dealing with nested expressions like this, there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer individually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or derive a formula for this.\n\nLooking at the expression: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s denote the innermost layer as a1, then a2, a3, up to a9, where each a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). So, starting from a1 = 1 + 3, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9.\n\nSo, let me write down the recursive formula:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. It seems that regardless of the approach, the answer remains consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression for a(n). Let me think about that. Each term a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, with a(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a(5) = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a(6) = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a(7) = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a(8) = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, a(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis further confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nExpression = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBut this seems similar to the recursive approach. Alternatively, if I expand the expression, I can see how many terms there are.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(next layer). So, expanding step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding one layer at a time:\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this is the same as before. It seems that regardless of the method\u2014whether step-by-step computation, using a recursive formula, or finding a closed-form expression\u2014the result is consistent.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplications, let me verify a couple of the larger multiplications again.\n\nFor example, when I computed 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nThen, since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 9841 has four digits: 9,8,4,1.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 in front, so the result is 29523. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, when computing 3*29524:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, all the multiplications check out.\n\nAnother way to verify would be to use another method, like binary exponentiation or logarithms, but that might complicate things further. Alternatively, I can compute the value using a calculator for the final multiplication to ensure that 3*29524 indeed equals 88572.\n\nBut since I don't have a calculator handy, I can verify 29524 *3:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n--------  \nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nNow, multiply each part by 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nTherefore, after multiple methods and verifications, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure of the problem, recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. Start computing from the innermost layer, working outward step by step.\n\n3. After computing each layer, substitute the result into the next layer until reaching the outermost expression.\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3 as per the original problem.\n\n5. Verify each step and multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\n6. As an additional check, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation and confirm that it matches the step-by-step result.\n\nAll these steps led me to the conclusion that the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary steps and checks to ensure the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm pretty sure this is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). We compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Compute the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but that's it, no more parentheses inside) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, okay, that might work. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, no, wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. Let me do it properly. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So 1500 +72=1572. Then, 87000 +1572=88572. Yes, that matches. So 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. I can check each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since that's the innermost part) Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part, and then finally multiply by 3. So, let's start calculating each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3 times 29,000 is 87,000. Then 3 times 524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate Layer 9 and the final multiplication. Layer 8 was 9841. So Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then add 1: 29,523 + 1 = 29,524. Okay, so Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29,524). Let me compute that again. 3*29,524: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the earlier layers which affects all subsequent calculations. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093 without the comma, but the value is correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270; 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then add 1: 3,279 + 1 = 3,280. So Layer 7 is 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let me compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600; 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then add 1: 9,840 + 1 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. As before, 9,841*3=29,523; plus 1 is 29,524. Correct. Then the final step: 3*29,524=88,572. So, after double-checking each layer, I confirm that the calculations are correct.

    "text": " Let me number the layers from the inside out for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then the next layer is 2, and so on up to layer 9. So, layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(result of layer 1). So, substituting the value from layer 1, it becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, layer 2 result is 13. Moving on to layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, layer 3 result is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result of layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 result is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result of layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 result is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result of layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 result is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result of layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 result is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result of layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 result is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(result of layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, layer 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let's calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps. Sometimes, when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me check the multiplication of 3*9841 again. 9841 * 3: 3*1 is 3, 3*4 is 12, carryover 1; 3*8 is 24 plus 1 is 25, carryover 2; 3*9 is 27 plus 2 is 29. So, writing it down: 9841 * 3 is 29523. Yes, that's correct. Then, 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that using another method. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7; 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 88572, which is 5 digits as well. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, my initial calculation was right. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've got it now. So, to recap, each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and finally multiplying the outermost result by 3. Each step built upon the previous one, and after computing all nine layers and then multiplying by 3, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the method works. Let's say I have a smaller expression with two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That works. Let's try three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Perfect, same result. So, my method is correct. Therefore, I can be confident that my answer for the original problem is accurate. I think I've got this figured out correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " Let me start by assigning each layer a step to make it easier. Let's number them from the inside out, so step 1 is the innermost, and step 9 is the outermost. Step 1: Innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, we have step 2: (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). Since step 1 gave us 4, step 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, step 2 simplifies to 13. Moving to step 3: (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). Step 2 was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, step 3 is 40. Now, step 4: (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). Step 3 was 40, so it's 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, step 4 is 121. Step 5: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). Step 4 was 121, so this is 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, step 5 is 364. Moving on to step 6: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). Step 5 was 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, step 6 is 1093. Step 7: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). Step 6 was 1093, so this is 1 + 3*1093. Let me figure that out: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, step 7 is 3280. Now, step 8: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). Step 7 was 3280, so it's 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, step 8 is 9841. Finally, step 9: (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). Step 8 was 9841, so this is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, step 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from step 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about it. Each step seems to be following a recursive pattern where each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. That is, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let a_n represent the value at step n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each step. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each step n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, the innermost expression is a_1, and the outermost expression is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for step 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Let me try to write it out as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the outermost layer. But each a_n is built as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, perhaps E = 3*a_9, and a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on. But I already found a formula for a_n, so maybe that's the easiest way. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with eight more layers after the first 1. So, in total, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which is 3*(a_9). But since I already have a formula for a_n, I can just compute a_9 and multiply by 3. As I did before, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, so E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for a geometric series. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k, where k increases with each layer. Let me try to see what that would look like. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, each time, it's like adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. But when I multiply the entire expression by 3 at the end, it's 3*(a_9). Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But this seems to get me back to the original expression. Maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach. Alternatively, since I have the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and I need a_9, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly using exponents. That's probably the quickest way once you recognize the pattern. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and using the closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is multiplied by the outermost 3. That sounds like a plan. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Therefore, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNext is Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. Therefore, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Thus, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Therefore, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we take Layer 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Hmm, let's break it down. 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524)*3. So, 29000*3 is 87000, and 524*3 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through the layers again to check each computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, maybe this is a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation here: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard method is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using both methods to see if they align.\n\nFor example, let's take n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches our earlier computation. Good.\n\nSimilarly, n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula is a quicker way, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to code this, I could write a loop that starts from the innermost layer and works outward, updating the value each time. But since I'm doing this manually, step by step is fine.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an additive constant. The closed-form formula accounts for both the geometric growth and the constant addition.\n\nIn summary, by either method\u2014step-by-step computation or using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation\u2014we arrive at the same final value for the expression. Therefore, the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, each Layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer one by one, starting from Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. I can break it down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Again, breaking it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. So, now that I've computed each layer up to Layer 9, the entire expression is equal to Layer 9, which is 29524. But wait, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). Let me confirm: The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, yes, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Let me just check one of the larger multiplications again, like Layer 9: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 24 + 24 = 48. So, adding up: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, plus 1000 is 59000, plus 48 is 59048. Then, add the third 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's break it down: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 48 + 24 = 72. So, 70000 + 18000 = 88000, plus 72 is 88072. Wait, that doesn't match my previous result of 88572. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in my addition? Let me check again. Wait, I think I messed up the breakdown. Let me try adding 59048 + 29524 properly. 59048 + 29524: Let's add the units place: 8 + 4 = 12. Carry over 1. Next, tens place: 4 + 2 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Next, hundreds place: 0 + 5 = 5. Thousands place: 9 + 9 = 18. Carry over 1. Ten-thousands place: 5 + 2 = 7, plus the carried 1 is 8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Ah, okay, so it is 88,572. I must have made a mistake in my earlier breakdown. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. That confirms the result. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and double-checking my work, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

So, layer 2 equals 13.\n\nNext, layer 3: (1 + 3*(layer 2)). Layer 2 is 13, so that's (1 + 3*13). Calculating 3*13 gives 39, then adding 1 gives 40. So, layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to layer 4: (1 + 3*(layer 3)). Layer 3 is 40, so it's (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(layer 4)). Layer 4 is 121, so (1 + 3*121). Let's compute 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(layer 5)). Layer 5 is 364, so (1 + 3*364). Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.

Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(layer 7)). Layer 7 is 3280, so (1 + 3*3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. Adding 9000 + 840 gives 9840.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n8 * 3 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 6, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8,6,7,7,1,7,5,7,2. Wait, that seems off. Let me actually compute it properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 2 = 26. Write down 6, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8,6,7,7,1,7,5,7,2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me actually compute it as 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 6, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nWait, that seems too long because 29524 is only 5 digits, so the multiplication should only have 6 digits at most. Let me correct this. Maybe I miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is 5 digits, so when multiplied by 3, it's:\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7        3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's only 5 digits, but 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572, which is 5 digits. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to ensure that each step was correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the layers check out correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression, perhaps? Let me see if there's a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*(4) + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*(13) + 1\n\nWait, that's similar to a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_{n} = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can solve for A and B using the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for the homogeneous part, when n approaches infinity, but perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, we can write this as:\n\nL_n + c = 3*(L_{n-1} + c)\n\nTo find c, we have:\n\nL_n + c = 3*L_{n-1} + 3c\n\nBut L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, so:\n\n3*L_{n-1} + 1 + c = 3*L_{n-1} + 3c\n\nSubtracting 3*L_{n-1} from both sides:\n\n1 + c = 3c\n\nSo, 1 = 2c => c = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n + 1/2 = 3*(L_{n-1} + 1/2)\n\nThis means that the sequence L_n + 1/2 is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n\nSo, L_n + 1/2 = (L_1 + 1/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nGiven that L_1 = 4, we have:\n\nL_n + 1/2 = (4 + 1/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, the value of layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, layer 9 is (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same answer more efficiently. That's pretty cool!\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was just starting out, breaking it down step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, I found that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation, which allowed me to compute the final result without having to expand all the parentheses manually. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations to simplify the computation.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\). Each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 3 \\times L_{n-1} + 1 \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second layer from the inside is 13. Now, moving one more layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40. Hmm, okay, I'm seeing a pattern here. Each layer is taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. So, maybe I can represent this as a sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. Let me denote the innermost result as a\u2081, then the next one as a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers. So, a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each a\u2099 is 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. So, starting from a\u2081, each subsequent a is built upon the previous one. So, a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 13, a\u2083 = 40, a\u2084 = 121, a\u2085 = 364, a\u2086 = 1093, a\u2087 = 3280, a\u2088 = 9841, a\u2089 = 29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089. Let me compute that. 3*29524 equals... let me do the multiplication. 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6 plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27 plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6 plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the sequence somewhere. Let me go through each a\u2099 again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with a\u2081: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na\u2082: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the a\u2089 value is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can check using another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nMultiply each part by 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems feasible. However, if the number of layers were larger, a formula would be more efficient. Let me explore that for a moment to see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could generalize this.\n\nLooking at the sequence of a\u2099: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its closed-form solution can be found. The general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B. We have:\n\na\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3\u207f + B = 3*(A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9) + 3*B + 1 = A*3\u207f + 3B + 1\n\nSo, left side: A*3\u207f + B\n\nRight side: A*3\u207f + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3\u207f + B = A*3\u207f + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3\u207f from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a\u2081 = A*3\u00b9 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3\u2074 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3\u2075 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3\u2076 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3\u2077 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3\u2078 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3\u2079 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, for the ninth term, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2 = 29524, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*(3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2 = (3\u00b9\u00b9 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3\u00b9\u00b9 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result. So, this formula approach also gives us the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, and the formula serves as a good verification tool. It's interesting how these nested expressions can be modeled with recurrence relations, and finding the closed-form solution can save time for larger expressions.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing the expression step by step without using the formula, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYep, that's consistent every time. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It's always good to verify using multiple methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with repetitive calculations that are prone to arithmetic errors.\n\nAlternatively, I can also think about this expression in terms of binary operations or other number systems, but in this case, since it's straightforward arithmetic, sticking to the step-by-step approach is the most reliable method. I guess the key takeaway here is recognizing the pattern and understanding that each layer depends on the previous one, allowing me to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a combinatorial interpretation or a connection to geometric series, but given the structure of the expression, it's more of a linear recurrence problem. However, knowing that it can be modeled with a recurrence relation is useful because it allows for a general solution regardless of the number of layers, which could be important if the problem had more nested expressions.\n\nIn summary, by methodically computing each layer from the inside out and verifying my results using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I can be certain that the final answer is accurate. It's a good practice to cross-check using different methods, especially when dealing with problems that involve multiple layers of operations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, when I look again, the innermost is Layer 9, and each outer layer adds another 3*(...). Wait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. So, starting with the innermost parentheses: Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, but looking at the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Let me correct that. Let me start by computing the innermost expression first. So, the innermost is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, that expression is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me try another layer to see if I can spot a pattern or a formula. Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when I started, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous). But actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recount the layers. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, there are 9 layers in total. Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then I have to multiply by 3. So, 3*29524 = 88572. But let me verify that step by step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let me go through each layer again, step by step, to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of layers: Starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. That seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have 9 layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, how many (1+3) are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each outer layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each adding a new (1+3*...). Therefore, the innermost is Layer1: (1+3)=4. Then Layer2: (1+3*4)=13. Layer3: (1+3*13)=40. Layer4: (1+3*40)=121. Layer5: (1+3*121)=364. Layer6: (1+3*364)=1093. Layer7: (1+3*1093)=3280. Layer8: (1+3*3280)=9841. Layer9: (1+3*9841)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition: a_1 =4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let's start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let me assign each innermost expression a variable to represent its value. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: Innermost is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 2: Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3: Then 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one.\n\nWait, but the expression starts with 3 multiplied by the first layer. Hmm, maybe I should consider that each layer is multiplied by 3, except perhaps the outermost one? Let me check.\n\nLooking again, the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which itself is 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, actually, every layer after the first one is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. So, perhaps I can model this as a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote a sequence where each term a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, that would be a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer out would be a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(a_9). So, I need to compute a_9 first and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me count the number of layers. Each time the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so the number of such layers is 9. Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer, and I can see that there are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, yes, nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, as I thought.\n\nSo, let me write down each a_n:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the innermost layer a_1 is 4, then each subsequent layer builds on that. Now, once I have a_9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, let me compute that.\n\nTotal expression value = 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 3 * 29524. Let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524\n\n*         3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make any mistake in the a_n calculations. Let me recompute each a_n step by step.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3:\n\n300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3:\n\n3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the a_n sequence, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each term step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nThis kind of recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r-1))*(r^n - 1) + (a_0*(r-1))/(r-1), but wait, actually, more precisely, the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series. Let me write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, actually, looking at the a_n terms:\n\na_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\na_2 = 13 = 3^3 + 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's consider that each a_n can be written as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait, so in general, a_n = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor a_1: n=1, so 1 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, it seems that a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, actually, starting from 3^0=1, then 3^1, up to 3^n.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=1, sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nSimilarly, when n=2, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds true for each a_n.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the formula applies correctly here because in our problem, a_1 corresponds to n=1, which is the innermost layer. So, in the problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the outermost inner expression, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, which we've done step by step, and it aligns with the formula.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer adds another power of 3. So, for each layer, you're effectively adding 3^k where k increases by 1 each time. So, after 9 layers, the innermost term is 3^1, then 3^2, up to 3^9, and the outermost term would be 3^10, but perhaps that's complicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series. Since each a_n is a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n.\n\nSo, for a_9, it's the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2, as we saw.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the next inner layer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))), which would be a sum of 3^1, 3^2, up to 3^9, plus 3^10, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps if I consider that each layer contributes a power of 3, then the entire expression, after multiplying by 3, would be 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 divided by 2 is 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series and then multiplying by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: sum from k=0 to n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nHere, n=9, so sum is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*sum = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer through multiple methods and checks. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outwards.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nThe entire expression is then computed by multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\cdot a_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer one by one, starting from Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Plugging in Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All the steps add up correctly, so I think this is the right answer. It's interesting how each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. It's like a geometric progression but nested within each other. I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe something like a geometric series or a recursive formula? Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That looks like a recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence might give a closed-form expression, which could be useful for problems with more layers. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like this is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads me to the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can make solving such problems more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming. I think I did everything correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute the final multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step. \n\n**Layer 1:** The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** Moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** Next, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let's see, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** Now, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Hmm, let's compute that. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I compute large numbers, I might miscount or add incorrectly. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Each layer was computed properly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives us 88572. I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set it up:\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, using this formula, we can directly compute a_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if there's a telescoping series or another approach, but given that we've already solved it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I think it's safe to say the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can perform the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building a number in base 3 or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. The recurrence relation approach worked well.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I was able to reach the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which was a good check on my work.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, maybe it's better to compute each Layer from 1 to 9 step by step. Let me try that. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Plugging in Layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, and 3*24 is 72. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, which would throw off the entire result. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. So, it seems my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I just had to be careful with each multiplication and addition step to avoid mistakes. I don't think I missed anything here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer from the inside out. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... Wait, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123, so 2400 + 123 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus 29524 again. Let's add 59048 + 29524.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, my final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again because sometimes when I see a pattern like this, maybe there's a formula or a geometric series involved. Let me see if I can model this expression as a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I did before. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 result I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I also get 88572. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, each layer adds another 3^n term. Wait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds a new term of 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each time. So, after k layers, the expression is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k}.\n\nWait, but in our problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), which would mean that each layer is a sum from 3^0 up to 3^{k} where k is the number of layers. Wait, let's test that.\n\nIf I have k layers, then a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nIf I expand this recursively, a_k = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k}.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. Let me compute that sum.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Here, r=3, n=10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9). So, S = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what we got earlier for a_9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives us 3*S = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, using the geometric series formula. That's a good check.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I first saw the expression, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(next layer), so each layer is like adding another 3^{n} term. So, the total sum after 9 layers would be the sum from n=0 to n=9 of 3^n, which is indeed (3^{10} - 1)/2, as I computed.\n\nSo, that confirms that a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, I would have to compute each layer one by one, which I did earlier, and that also gave me the same result.\n\nI think I've checked it enough ways. The final answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, the final result is 3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to find the result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check if that's correct. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms using the recurrence and see if I can find a pattern. a_1=4. a_2=1+3*4=13. a_3=1+3*13=40. a_4=1+3*40=121. a_5=1+3*121=364. a_6=1+3*364=1093. a_7=1+3*1093=3280. a_8=1+3*3280=9841. a_9=1+3*9841=29524. So, a_9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Now, trying to find a general formula for a_n: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2. Let me compute 243*243: 200*200=40,000, 200*43=8,600, 43*200=8,600, 43*43=1,849. Wait, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 243*243: 200+40+3=243. So, (200+40+3)^2=200^2 + 2*200*40 + 40^2 + 2*200*3 + 2*40*3 +3^2. Wait, that's too complicated. Alternatively, 243*243: 243*200=48,600; 243*40=9,720; 243*3=729. Adding them together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59,049. Therefore, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the recurrence relation and the formula for the general solution, we determine that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost coefficient**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression starts with the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, it's (1 + 3(...)), so that's another layer\n3. Continuing this way, I think there are nine layers in total.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on until the outermost one.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first layer is (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...))\n3. Continuing until the last one is (1 + 3), which doesn't have another layer after it.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have the first \"(\" starting at 1 + 3(...). So that's layer 1.\n2. Then inside that, another \"(\", so layer 2.\n3. Continuing, layer 3, layer 4, layer 5, layer 6, layer 7, layer 8, layer 9.\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), so that's layer 9, right? Because each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, we have 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, if I define a\u2081 as the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3), then a\u2082 would be 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on up to a\u2089. Then the total expression is 3a\u2089. So, let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\nLet me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, define a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Because if a\u2081 is the innermost, then a\u2082 is the next layer out, and so on, up to a\u2089 being the outermost before the final 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so that would correspond to 3a\u2089, where a\u2089 is the result of the innermost expression.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not off by one in the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers by looking at the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The first one is (1+3(...\n2. Then another (1+3(...\n3. Continuing until the last one, which is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count the opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nWait, actually, each layer adds a new \"1+3(\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nLayer 9: (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, I think there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a_i from a\u2081 to a\u2089.\n\nWait, but when I computed a\u2081 to a\u2089, I got a\u2089 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3 times that, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. But wait, let me check that because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each a_i again step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting over:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, a\u2086=1+1092=1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, a\u2087=1+3279=3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840. Thus, a\u2088=1+9840=9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523; so 27000+2523=29523. Thus, a\u2089=1+29523=29524.\n\nNow, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total value is 88572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, in the original problem, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times I have to compute a_i before I get to the outermost expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent the expression as a recursive formula. Let me denote that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I define a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a\u2081=4, a\u2082=13, etc., up to a\u2089=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see.\n\nThe general formula for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a\u2081 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, so this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Because sometimes when you're counting layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's nine layers. So, a\u2089 is indeed the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, the total value is 3*a\u2089 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To double-check, perhaps I can compute a few more terms using the formula.\n\nFor example, a\u2083 should be (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which matches.\n\na\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. Therefore, a\u2089 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_i \\) where each term corresponds to a layer starting from the innermost parentheses. The innermost term is \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\). Each subsequent term is defined as \\( a_i = 1 + 3a_{i-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The total expression is \\( 3a_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer wraps around it, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on, I can eventually get the value of the entire expression. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the value I just calculated, 29524, is inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply that by 3. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the layers again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. I recall that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for the recurrence relation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: (A*3^n + B) - 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1.\n\nSimplify: A*3^n + B - 3A*3^{n-1} - 3B = 1.\n\nBut 3A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n, so we have A*3^n + B - A*3^n - 3B = 1 => (-2B) = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nWait, that seems a bit odd because when I computed the layers, all the a_n were integers, so getting a B of -1/2 might complicate things. Let me check my steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I assumed the particular solution is a constant B. But perhaps I need to adjust that. Alternatively, maybe I can solve it using iteration.\n\nLet me try expanding the recurrence a few times to see the pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as before, a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try writing out the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, expanding this:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, after k steps:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{k}*a_{n - k}\n\nIf I continue this until I reach a_1, then:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*a_1\n\nBecause starting from a_n and expanding each term, we get a sum of 1's multiplied by increasing powers of 3, plus 3^{n-1} times a_1.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, then:\n\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} * a_1 / 3\n\nWait, let me see. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the sum as:\n\na_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} * a_1 / 3^{1}\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\na_1 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 + something? Wait, 3^2 is 9, 9 - 1 = 8, 8/2 = 4. Hmm, that works for a_1.\n\na_2 = 13. Let's see: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. That's exactly a_2.\n\na_3 = 40. (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Perfect.\n\na_4 = 121. (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Yes, that's a_4.\n\na_5 = 364. (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nSo, it seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting this formula:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. So, the total after n layers would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, computing this for n=9 gives me a_9=29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\), each subsequent layer is calculated. The general formula for the nth term is found to be \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so it's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's break it down. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3. Maybe it's easier to do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed using a geometric series or a recursive formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3, so maybe there's a way to express the total as a sum.\n\nBut given that I've already solved it using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods agree, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and identify each layer.\n\n2. Compute each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) outward (Layer 9).\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to avoid repetitive computation.\n\n4. Verify the result using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer step by step up to \\( a_9 \\), then multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can find the value. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, let me do it step by step to avoid confusion. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, but wait, no, the original number is 29524, so starting from the left: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, maybe I should compute it as:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me verify that again:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst digit (units): 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nSecond digit (tens): 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nThird digit (hundreds): 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nFourth digit (thousands): 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nFifth digit (ten thousands): 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048\n+29524\n=88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, but let me double-check because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might make a mistake in the earlier layers, which would throw off the entire result. Let me go back and verify each layer quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all layers check out. So, I think I did it correctly. Each step builds on the previous one, and since each layer was computed correctly, the final result should be accurate. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested computation that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to break it down layer by layer. Let's start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). So, let's denote each layer as follows: Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 step by step. Let me compute each layer one by one. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, so each layer seems to be increasing rapidly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step as I did before might be the simplest way. However, for future reference, if I have more layers, I might need a formula. Let me think about it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, the formula confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is calculated until reaching the ninth layer. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, the ninth layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me calculate that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let me compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is... 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72, so 1500 + 72 is 1572. So, adding 87000 + 1572 gives 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 3*29524. Let me compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is built upon the previous one, and by working from the inside out, it's manageable.

Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting, it's increasing quite a bit. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.

Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, step 1 result is 4. Now, moving one layer out, step 2 would be 3 times the result of step 1, plus 1. Wait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the inside and moving outwards, each time computing the value of the current layer by taking 1 + 3*(result of the next layer). Let me try that. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is step 1: Step 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Step 2: Now, moving one layer out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(step1 result)). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, step 2 result is 13. Step 3: Next layer out is (1 + 3*(step2 result)). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, step 3 result is 40. Step 4: Then, (1 + 3*(step3 result)) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Step 4 result is 121. Step 5: Next, (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Step 5 result is 364. Step 6: Then, (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; adding them up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Step 6 result is 1093. Step 7: Next layer is (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Step 7 result is 3280. Step 8: Then, (1 + 3*3280). Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Step 8 result is 9841. Step 9: Finally, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, step 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this step 9 result. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.

So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was trying to define the layers, I went up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3, which gave me 88572. But when I first thought of it, I mistakenly went up to Layer 10, which was incorrect because the original expression only has nine layers inside the outermost 3. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first started, I thought of 10 layers, but now it's clear that the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds one more, so with nine layers, and then the outermost multiplication by 3, making it 10 steps, but the outermost is just the multiplication, not another layer. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the outermost layer. So, the layers are from 1 to 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in computing each Layer. Let me go through each Layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values to ensure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is building up a sum that can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut since each layer is nested, it's more like a finite geometric series with multiple layers. Alternatively, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost part outward:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: Innermost layer: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up the solution. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nWe just found Layer 1 is 4, so:\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 2 is 13, so:\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 3 is 40, so:\n\nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 4 is 121, so:\n\nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 5 is 364, so:\n\nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 6 is 1093, so:\n\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 7 is 3280, so:\n\nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nLayer 8 is 9841, so:\n\nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3=29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524\n\nCalculating that: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an error with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I did it right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1. It's a geometric progression, actually. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form formula for a geometric series might help here. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} - 1)/2, as we saw.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible, and I think I did that correctly.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe will compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost layer.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result. Let me check the original problem again: it's 3 times the entire nested expression. So, the final step is to compute 3*(29524). Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplications.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is the pattern. Then, finally, multiplying the last result by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure that I didn't skip any layers or make any multiplication errors. Another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a general formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for each subsequent layer, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). Let me compute f(1) through f(9):\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, indeed, f(9) is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. This confirms my earlier calculation. It seems consistent. I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. I think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems to add up correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a function \\( f(n) \\) where \\( n \\) is the number of layers, with \\( f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \\). Each subsequent layer is computed as \\( f(n) = 1 + 3 \\cdot f(n-1) \\).

Starting with the innermost part: Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since that's the innermost part) Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3. So, I can approach this by computing each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 result is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 result is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 result is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 result is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 result is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 result is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 result is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9 result), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's right. I don't see any errors in my steps. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

    "text": " Let me assign each layer a number to keep track. Starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3 (but wait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, but then it's multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Hmm, maybe I should start evaluating from the innermost and move outwards step by step. Let me try that. Let's denote each step as starting from the innermost and moving outward. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nBut wait, that's just 1 + 3, but in the original expression, each inner expression is 1 + 3*(next inner expression). So, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should compute starting from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try again.\n\nLet me think of the expression as having multiple layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(next layer). Since the innermost part is 1 + 3, but that's not quite right because each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). Wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the first layer. Let me check: the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, once I compute Layer 9, I multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recount the layers because the original expression has 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), and so on up to Layer 1, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). Wait, no, actually, the outermost is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on. So, maybe I should index the layers starting from the innermost as Layer 1, moving outward to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, perhaps I misnumbered the layers earlier. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1 + 3(...) parts. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a new layer, so starting from 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, the next is 1 + 3*(layer 1), that's layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, until layer 9, which would be the outermost 1 + 3*(layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the first layer, which is 1 + 3*(layer 2). So, perhaps it's better to index the layers starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9, which is the innermost part of the outermost 1 + 3*(...). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nlayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nlayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nlayer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nlayer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nlayer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nlayer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nlayer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nlayer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so if layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each layer is 1 + 3n. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence.\n\nLet me see: Let's define a recurrence relation where a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 would be the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nThe recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_k^{(h)} = C*3^k.\n\nA particular solution would be a constant, say a_k^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When k=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this works for k=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, from k=1 to k=9, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, layer 9 was 29524, and 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572 as the result.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me recompute each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the outermost layer is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n3. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the result is 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
