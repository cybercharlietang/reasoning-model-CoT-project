Let's add them: 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again: 29524 * 3: Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. I don't think there's a shortcut here because each term depends on the previous one, so we have to compute each layer step by step. So, to recap, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, each time, it's like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, and so on up to a_9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let me compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, hold on, that's different from my earlier result. Earlier, I thought it was 87572, but now I'm getting 88572. Hmm, that means I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit from the right. Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0. Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands place), 7 (hundreds place), 5 (tens place), 2 (units place). So that's 88,752. Wait, but when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I got 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. So both methods give me 88,572, but earlier I thought it was 87,572. That was a mistake. So the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm once more because I don't want to make a mistake here. Let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 + 29524: Let's add 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 20 = 59044, 59044 + 4 = 59048. Now, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 20 = 88568, 88568 + 4 = 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was correct, and the earlier confusion was due to a miscalculation when I thought it was 87,572. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid now. Each step checks out, and the multiplication is confirmed by adding 29524 three times. So I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 87572. Therefore, the final answer is 87572. But wait, let me verify this because I might have made an error in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any. Starting from the innermost: Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is a bit different. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s. In this problem, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so r=3, s=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since s is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, we compute each layer up to the ninth layer, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3(\\text{previous term}) \\), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 87572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{87572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so 7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, the result is 87572. Wait, but let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 87572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me check if that's correct. Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct. Then 3*29524 is 87572. So, the final answer should be 87572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 87572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=87572. So, the final answer is 87572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my reasoning. Wait, no, because the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} correctly. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, but earlier I computed 3*29524=87572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check. If a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. But according to the formula, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, which one is correct? There's a conflict here, which means I must have made an error in either the formula or the step-by-step computation. Let me check the step-by-step computation again. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524. Then 3*29524=87572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572. There's a difference of 88572 - 87572=1000. That's a big difference, so I must have messed up somewhere. Let me check the formula again. The recurrence is a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D. Let's solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h)=C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^(p)=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K=1+3*K \u21d2 K-3K=1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K=-1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n=C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1=4: 4=C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4=3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C=(9/2)/3=3/2. So, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, that formula is correct. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. But according to the formula, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2=177144/2=88572. Wait, that's inconsistent. So, where is the mistake? Let's see, perhaps I misapplied the formula. The formula is for a_n, which is the innermost expression before the outermost multiplication by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. So, that should be correct. But according to step-by-step computation, it's 87572, while the formula gives 88572. Therefore, one of them must be wrong. Let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572. Alternatively, 3*29524=87572. Let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, 87572. But according to the formula, it's 88572. There's a 1000 difference. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check each layer again. Starting from Layer1=4. Layer2=1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer3=1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4=1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5=1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=87572. So, according to step-by-step, it's 87572. But according to the formula, it's 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That suggests that the formula is correct, so perhaps my step-by-step is wrong. Wait, but where? Let me check the step-by-step again. Let me compute Layer9 again: 1 + 3*Layer8. Layer8 was 9841. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer9=29524. Then, 3*29524=87572. But according to the formula, it's 88572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me see. The formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. So, according to the formula, the entire expression is 87572. But earlier, I thought the formula gives 88572, which is wrong. Wait, no. Wait, I think I misapplied the formula. The formula is for a_n, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572. But according to step-by-step, it's 87572. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Let me compute 3*a_9 using the formula: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572. Therefore, 87572 vs 88572. The difference is 1000. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11}-3)/2=177144/2=88572. But step-by-step gives 87572. So, which is correct? Let me compute 3*29524 manually. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, 87572. Therefore, the step-by-step is correct, and the formula must have been misapplied. Wait, but why? The formula is for a_n, which is the innermost expression before the outermost multiplication by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. But according to step-by-step, 3*a_9=87572, which is (3^{11}-3)/2=88572. Wait, but 3^{11}=177147, so 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. But 3*29524=87572. So, 88572 vs 87572. There's a 1000 difference. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here because the entire expression is 3*a_9, not a_{10}. Let me think again. The formula gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=87572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a_{10}, which would be 1 + 3*a_9, but in the problem, it's 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. Therefore, the formula gives a_n as the value inside the outermost parentheses before the multiplication by 3. So, the final answer is 3*a_9=87572. Therefore, the formula approach must have been misapplied earlier when I thought it gave 88572. So, the correct answer is 87572. Alternatively, to confirm, let me compute using the formula step-by-step. Since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. So, the formula approach and step-by-step agree, giving 87572 as the final answer. Therefore, the correct answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. However, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute it more efficiently, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in my earlier computation, a_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve such a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result using a different method. It's reassuring that both methods give the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 87572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which is different. So I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 8 (from the 2*3 +2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5, then 7, then 2. So that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=87572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Wait, did I make a mistake here? Wait, no, because a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. But 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Wait, but earlier, I computed 3*29524=87572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my earlier calculations. Wait, 3^{10}=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572? Wait, wait, 29524*3: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly: 29524*3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. But wait, that's not considering the place values correctly. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation where I thought it was 87572. So, the correct result is 88572. Let me confirm this using the formula: 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, my initial calculation of 87572 was wrong. I must have miscalculated earlier when I thought 3*29524=87572. Let me check that again: 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 87572. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88572. Let me go back and check where I went wrong. Initially, when I computed 3*29524, I thought it was 87572, but now I see it's actually 88572. So, that's the correct answer. Therefore, the solution is 88572. I think that's the right approach. So, the key was to recognize the pattern, compute each layer step by step, and then use the formula to find the closed-form solution to avoid errors in multiplication.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. I can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if they match. For example, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct, as before. a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the closed-form solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), for \\( n = 9 \\), we find \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 87572. Hmm, but wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down: 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from before. So which one is correct? Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me check again: 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result should be 87572, but when I broke it down, it was 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the breakdown again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So the breakdown says 88572, but the digit-by-digit method gave me 87572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me try digit-by-digit again: 29524 * 3: Let's write it out:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But the breakdown method gave me 88572. There's a conflict here. I must have made a mistake in either the digit-by-digit or the breakdown. Let me check the breakdown again: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding them step by step: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So the breakdown is 88572, but digit-by-digit is 87572. There's a difference of 1000. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits in the digit-by-digit method. Let me write it properly:\n\n          2 9 5 2 4\n        x       3\n        -----------\n          8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but that would mean 29524 * 3 = 87572. But according to the breakdown, it's 88572. I must have made a mistake in either the digit-by-digit or the breakdown. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the layers. Let me go back and check the layers again because perhaps I made an error in computing Layer 9. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me try again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But according to the breakdown, it's 88572. Wait, that's a problem. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo according to this, 29524 * 3 = 88572. But when I did the digit-by-digit method, I got 87572. There must be a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me check the digits again:\n\n29524 is:\n\nDigit positions (from right): 4 (units), 2 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 9 (thousands), 2 (ten thousands)\n\nSo, 2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But the breakdown method gives 88572. There's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check with another approach: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = ?\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carry 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 write 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carry 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Therefore, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That means the digit-by-digit method was wrong. I must have miscounted the digits. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did the digit-by-digit, I wrote:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nBut actually, the digits are:\n\nPosition: 5 4 3 2 1\n\nDigits:    2 9 5 2 4\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me index the digits properly. The number 29524 has digits as follows:\n\nFrom right to left:\n\nPosition 1: 4 (units)\n\nPosition 2: 2 (tens)\n\nPosition 3: 5 (hundreds)\n\nPosition 4: 9 (thousands)\n\nPosition 5: 2 (ten thousands)\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3, we start with position 1:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nPosition 2: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nPosition 3: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nPosition 4: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nPosition 5: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (position 5), 7 (position 4), 5 (position 3), 7 (position 2), 2 (position 1). Wait, that would be 87572. But when adding 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a conflict. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again using the standard multiplication method.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x         3\n   ------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. That suggests that one of the methods is incorrect. Let me check the addition again:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carry 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, adding another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 write 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carry 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nBut when I multiplied 29524 by 3 using digit-by-digit, I got 87572, which is different. There's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing the result. Let me write the multiplication properly:\n\n          2 9 5 2 4\n        x       3\n        -----------\n          8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but that would mean 87572, but the addition shows 88572. I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me try to write it out with proper alignment:\n\n          2 9 5 2 4\n        x       3\n        -----------\n          8 7 5 7 2\n\nBut according to the addition, it's 88572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again, perhaps I missed a digit.\n\nWait, 29524 has five digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But the addition method gave me 88572. There's a discrepancy of 1000. I must have made a mistake in the addition. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 20 = 88568\n\n88568 + 4 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the digit-by-digit multiplication must have an error. Let me try to compute 29524 * 3 again, perhaps I missed a digit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87572. But according to addition, it's 88572. There's a conflict. I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Wait, perhaps I missed a digit. Let me count the digits:\n\n29524 has 5 digits. Multiplying by 3, the product should have 5 or 6 digits. 29524 * 3 = 88572, which is 5 digits. So, 87572 is 5 digits, but according to addition, it's 88572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check the digits again:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the position of the digits. Let me write the number as:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n4 (units) * 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit 2, carry 1.\n\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit 7, carry 0.\n\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit 5, carry 1.\n\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit 8, carry 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands digit 8.\n\nSo, writing from ten thousands to units: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 87572. But the addition shows 88572. There's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me check the thousands digit:\n\nAfter multiplying the thousands digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry from hundreds place) = 28. So, we write 8 in the thousands place and carry 2 to the ten thousands place. Then, the ten thousands digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, the ten thousands digit is 8, thousands digit is 8, hundreds digit is 5, tens digit is 7, units digit is 2. Wait, no, that would make it 88572. Wait, but according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I wrote 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). That can't be right because after the thousands place, the carry affects the ten thousands place. Let me try to write the multiplication properly with carries:\n\n          2  9  5  2  4\n        x      3\n        ------------\n          12 (from 4*3) \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. I think I made a mistake earlier in the digit-by-digit method by misaligning the digits. So, the correct product is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me just verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result is 87572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 87572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when you carry over, it's easy to make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, now I'm confused. Did I make a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication?\n\nWait, let me check the digit-by-digit again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out, the product is 87572. But when I broke it down into parts, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. No carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carried 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8 and carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but when I did the part-by-part multiplication, I got 88572. That can't be right. Let me check the part-by-part again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with the digit-by-digit method. There must be a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I broke down 29524 incorrectly.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. That's correct. So 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. So adding those gives 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. But the digit-by-digit method gave me 87572. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit. Let me do it again, more carefully.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 1: 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Add carryover 1: 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. Therefore, the digit-by-digit method is correct, and the part-by-part must have an error. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when breaking it down. Let me check 29524 again.\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when I broke it down, I had:\n\n20000 (correct)\n9000 (correct)\n500 (correct)\n20 (correct)\n4 (correct)\n\nSo, 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 = 29524. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nBut digit-by-digit says 87572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check with another approach: using standard multiplication.\n\nLet me write 29524 * 3:\n\n3\n\u00d729524\n-------\nMultiply each digit by 3, starting from the right.\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but when I did the part-by-part, I got 88572. That must mean I added incorrectly. Let me check the part-by-part addition again.\n\n60000 (from 20000*3)\n+27000 (from 9000*3) = 87000\n+1500 (from 500*3) = 88500\n+60 (from 20*3) = 88560\n+12 (from 4*3) = 88572.\n\nHmm, but the digit-by-digit is 87572. There's a 1000 difference here. I must have made a mistake in the part-by-part. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 9000*3. 9000*3 is 27000, that's correct. 500*3 is 1500, correct. 20*3 is 60, correct. 4*3 is 12, correct. So adding 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. But digit-by-digit gives 87572. There's a discrepancy of 1000. I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 using another approach. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 30000*3 = 90000, then subtract 476*3. 476*3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So total is 1200+210=1410+18=1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. So that's consistent with the part-by-part method. Therefore, the correct result is 88572, and the digit-by-digit method must have an error. Let me check the digit-by-digit again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\n     8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, that would mean 29524 * 3 = 87572. But according to the other method, it's 88572. There's a contradiction here. Let me check using a calculator. Wait, I don't have a calculator, but I can verify by another method.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But when I broke it down into parts, I got 88572. There's a 1000 difference. I must have made a mistake in the part-by-part method. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the place values. Let me check:\n\n29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the digit-by-digit, it's 87572. There's a 1000 difference. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit. Let me check the digit positions again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it out properly with place values:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 (units) * 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit: 2, carryover: 1.\n\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit: 7, carryover: 0.\n\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit: 5, carryover: 1.\n\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit: 8, carryover: 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands digit: 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87572.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down into parts, I got 88572. There must be a mistake in the part-by-part breakdown. Let me check:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct. So why is the digit-by-digit giving me 87572? There must be a mistake in the digit-by-digit. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me check the number of digits in 29524. It's a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWhen I multiply by 3, the product should be a 5-digit number, but 29524*3=88572, which is a 5-digit number starting with 8. Wait, but according to the digit-by-digit, it's 87572, which is also a 5-digit number starting with 8. Wait, but 29524*3 is 88572, not 87572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit.\n\nWait, let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again, digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But according to the part-by-part, it's 88572. Wait, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit. Let me check the multiplication again:\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units.\n\nSo, 2 ten thousands * 3 = 6 ten thousands = 60000.\n\n9 thousands * 3 = 27 thousands = 27000.\n\n5 hundreds * 3 = 15 hundreds = 1500.\n\n2 tens * 3 = 6 tens = 60.\n\n4 units * 3 = 12 units = 12.\n\nAdding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct result must be 88572, which means I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Perhaps I misaligned the digits or miscalculated somewhere. Let me try the digit-by-digit again, carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but this contradicts the part-by-part method. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let's go through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nAs per the part-by-part method, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572, and the digit-by-digit must have an error. Let me try the digit-by-digit once more, perhaps I missed a digit.\n\nWait, 29524 is five digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, the product is 87572. Wait, that's the same as before. But the part-by-part gives 88572. I must be making a mistake in one of the methods. Let me try another approach: using the standard multiplication algorithm with place values.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     \u00d7         3\n     ------------\n       8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, that's 87572. But when I broke it down, I got 88572. There's a 1000 difference. I must have made a mistake in the part-by-part breakdown. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 9000*3. 9000*3 is 27000, that's correct. 500*3 is 1500, correct. 20*3 is 60, correct. 4*3 is 12, correct. So adding 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the digit-by-digit method is incorrect because I didn't account for the carryover correctly. Wait, let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 using another method: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent with the part-by-part method. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572, and the digit-by-digit method must have been done incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing the product. Let me write it out again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87572. But according to the other methods, it's 88572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the layer calculations. Let me check the layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nIf I compute 29524 * 3 correctly, it should be 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit, I got 87572, which is different. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try once more:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87572. But according to the other methods, it's 88572. There's a 1000 difference. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me check the layers again. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the layers are correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572 is the correct answer. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method earlier. Perhaps I miscalculated 9 * 3 as 27 instead of 28. Wait, 9*3=27, plus carryover 1 makes 28, which is correct. Then, 2*3=6 +2=8. So, that's correct. Therefore, the digit-by-digit must be wrong, but according to other methods, it's 88572. I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial digit-by-digit. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 using another approach: 29524 is 29524. Let me write it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit, I thought it was 87572. I must have made a mistake there. Let me check the digit-by-digit again, perhaps I miscounted the carryover.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87572. Wait, that's different from the part-by-part method. I'm really confused now. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check using a different approach: let's compute 29524 * 3 using expanded notation.\n\n29524 = 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 2*10000*3 + 9*1000*3 + 5*100*3 + 2*10*3 + 4*1*3\n\n= 6*10000 + 27*1000 + 15*100 + 6*10 + 12*1\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.

Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing the layers in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B - 3*B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is correct. I think I'm confident now that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next innermost layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8. Ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo writing it out: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So that's 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if I made a mistake there, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)): There's one after the initial 3, then another, and so on. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(previous layer + 1). Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then\n2. The next is 1+3(1+3), which is 1+3*(previous)\n3. Then another layer around that, making it 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. Continuing until we have 9 layers? Wait, maybe I need to recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo let's count the number of (1+3(...)) terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4\n- Then, moving out, Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+3*4=13\n- Layer 3: 1+3*(Layer2)=1+3*13=40\n- Layer 4: 1+3*(Layer3)=1+3*40=121\n- Layer5: 1+3*(Layer4)=1+3*121=364\n- Layer6: 1+3*(Layer5)=1+3*364=1093\n- Layer7: 1+3*(Layer6)=1+3*1093=3280\n- Layer8: 1+3*(Layer7)=1+3*3280=9841\n- Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8)=1+3*9841=29524\n- Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but I just noticed that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so Layer9 is inside the 3*() of the outermost expression. So that's correct. So the total layers are 9, and each time we compute the innermost first. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations again because sometimes when you compute step by step, you might make a mistake in multiplication or addition. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute 29524*3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation because each layer is defined by a recurrence. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis approach confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method also confirms that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3, so the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is defined recursively, the recurrence approach is more straightforward.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, we have a term of 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nBut this seems a bit tangled because each layer is inside another. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. But since we've already computed it step by step and via the recurrence relation, maybe it's not necessary unless I'm looking for a formula.\n\nBut since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), step-by-step computation is feasible and accurate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and since we have 9 layers, we can compute a_9 as we did earlier.\n\nIn summary, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying through multiple methods, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the outermost layer (a_9) equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, let's see if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer n is equal to 1 + 3*layer(n-1). So, layer(n) = 1 + 3*layer(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nGiven layer(n) = a*layer(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1 here.\n\nThe general solution is layer(n) = (layer(0) - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a)\n\nWait, but in our case, layer(1) = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 1 + 3, so maybe layer(1) = 4, layer(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model it starting from n=0. Let me adjust the indices for easier calculation.\n\nLet me define layer(n) where n=0 is 1, then layer(1) = 1 + 3*1 = 4, layer(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nSo, in this case, layer(n) = 1 + 3*layer(n-1), with layer(0) = 1.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is layer(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say layer_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is layer(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition layer(0) = 1:\n\n1 = C*3^0 + (-1/2)\n1 = C*1 - 1/2\nC = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, layer(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=0: layer(0) = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, layer(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is layer(1)=4, which corresponds to n=1. Wait, but in the problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me recount the layers to make sure.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we add a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 1+3\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have an additional layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because the expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers of 1+3*(...). Wait, maybe that's where I went wrong earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this correctly. Let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the parentheses. Each time I have 1+3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, we have 1+3(layer1), which is layer2.\n3. Then, 1+3(layer2) = layer3.\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is layer9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to n=1 to n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to layer9 as 29524, which then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But according to the formula, layer(n) = (3^(n+1)-1)/2. So, layer9 would be (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check with the formula. Since the entire expression is 3*layer9, and layer9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression would be 3*(3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\n3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, then divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 1+3\n\nWait, that's 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 8 layers inside, plus the initial 3. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression with each layer labeled.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where ... is Layer8.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3\n\nSo, starting from Layer1, each subsequent layer wraps around the previous one. So, the expression is 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is 1 + 3*(Layer8), etc., down to Layer1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of layers is 9, each corresponding to n=1 to n=9 in the formula. Therefore, layer9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572? Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step. 4 * 3 = 12.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 88,572. Wait, that's different from what I had before. So, 29524 * 3 is 88,572, not 87,572. I think I missed a digit earlier. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60,000. 9000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.

It's important to double-check each step, especially when dealing with larger numbers. So, to recap, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let's do it again carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28.

There's a discrepancy here. Let me check using a calculator approach:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*     3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572. Wait, but when I broke it down into place values, I got 88,572. Clearly, I made a mistake there. Let's recompute that breakdown:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the digit-by-digit method. I must have messed up the digit positions in the digit-by-digit method. Let me check again:\n\n29,524 is:\n\n- 2 in ten thousands place: 20,000\n- 9 in thousands place: 9,000\n- 5 in hundreds place: 500\n- 2 in tens place: 20\n- 4 in units place: 4\n\nSo when I multiply by 3:\n\n- 20,000 *3=60,000\n- 9,000*3=27,000\n- 500*3=1,500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nAdding these: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. That means I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me try the digit-by-digit method again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Units digit: 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 (tens place) *3=6 +1=7. Tens digit:7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit:5 (hundreds place)*3=15.

Ten thousands digit:8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 87,572. But according to the place value addition, it's 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in how I assigned the digits. Wait, 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4, right? So when I multiply:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Units:2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7. Tens:7, carryover0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15. Hundreds:5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28. Thousands:8, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8. Ten thousands:8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 29,524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when we multiply, the digits are processed from units to ten thousands. So, after multiplying, the digits would be:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Ten thousands:8\n\nSo, writing it as 88,572. Wait, but in the digit-by-digit, I thought it was 87,572. Wait, perhaps I misplaced the thousands digit. Let me write it out step by step:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8 (from 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 in thousands place, carryover2)\n\n- Ten thousands:8 (from 2*3 +2=8)\n\nSo, the number is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, that's 88,572. So, my initial digit-by-digit approach had a mistake where I thought the thousands digit was 7, but it's actually 8. So, the correct multiplication is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because I'm confused. Let me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524\n*    3\n--------\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write7, carryover0.\n\n5*3=15, write5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524.\n\nCompute 29524 +29524:\n\n29524 +29524:\n\n4+4=8\n\n2+2=4\n\n5+5=10, write0, carryover1\n\n9+9=18 +1=19, write9, carryover1\n\n2+2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 +29524=59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 +29524:\n\n8+4=12, write2, carryover1.\n\n4+2=6 +1=7, write7, carryover0.\n\n0+5=5, write5.\n\n9+9=18, write8, carryover1.\n\n5+2=7 +1=8, write8.\n\nSo, 59048 +29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nSo, to recap, I started by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, each time substituting the computed value into the next layer. After computing Layer 9 as 29,524, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final answer of 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes this time, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step. After computing the outermost layer, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88,572? Wait, but 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me check with addition: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add them: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, 4 + 2 = 6, 0 + 5 = 5, 9 + 9 = 18, 5 + 2 = 7. Wait, that's not correct. Let me do it properly: 59048 + 29524: Starting from the units digit: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8. So, total is 88,572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer (Layer 9) equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 87572. Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my addition: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. So that's correct. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? Let's see: 29524 * 3: Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result should be 88572, right? Wait, but when I did the digit-by-digit, I thought it was 87572. That's where I messed up. So, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.

Wait, let me check that multiplication again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, carry 0, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, so 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing from the top: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it using another method to confirm. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, multiply each by 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because if that's correct, then the final answer is 88572. Let me go back through the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3 times Layer 9, but looking back at the original problem, it's 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2:1+3*4=13, etc., up to Layer 9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, you might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3(, how many times does 1+3( occur? Let's see: 1+3( occurs 8 times, right? Because each time you have 1+3(, and then it's nested 8 times, leading to 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step to confirm I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent.

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. But I need another equation to solve for A and B. Alternatively, since the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result.

So, the correct multiplication is 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

But let me double-check all my previous steps because it's easy to make a mistake in these nested computations. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but let me check one more time the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit again, carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carried 1: 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So that's 88,572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is 1 + 3(...). How many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, that's nine layers, each starting with 3(1 + 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, I think my computation is accurate. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, it's 87572. Therefore, the final answer is 87572. But let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 87572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the numbers are manageable, perhaps computing each term step by step is easier. But just for understanding, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, using both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using both iterative computation and a derived closed-form formula, we determine that the final result is 87572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Oh no, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check Layer 8 again: Layer 8 is 1 + 3*Layer7. Layer7 was 3280. So, 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct. Then Layer9 is 1 + 3*9841.

So, each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've computed each layer step by step, checked the arithmetic, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 87572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 500 = 88548. Then, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Wait, so that's 88572, but when I did the multiplication digit by digit, I got 87572. That means I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me correct that. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 (from the 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So, that must be correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 87572, but that's incorrect. So, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to be the correct final answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without manually calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing the result without calculating each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But since the expression is finite with nine layers, the step-by-step approach is manageable.\n\nJust to recap, the expression is built as follows:\n\nStart with 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After nine such layers, multiply the result by 3. So, each layer adds another power of 3, which is why the general formula using the recurrence relation is helpful.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and checking the arithmetic. All methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to compute it more efficiently. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, which might be faster if I recognize the pattern early on. So, either way, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But wait, let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. So, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3 * 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. Then, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, each layer L(n) can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, using the formula gives the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used a formula approach to confirm, and both methods led to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, 7; carryover 0. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8, 8. So yes, 87572. So, the final answer would be 87572. Wait, but let me verify my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Wait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 87572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. So, the final answer is 3 * 29524 = 87572. Therefore, the computed value is 87572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, if the expression were just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That would be three layers instead of nine. Let me compute that step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, using the formula: L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 39? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this smaller case, we have three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, outermost: 3*13 = 39. Using the formula, L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Wait, in the smaller case, how many layers? Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, that's three layers inside the outermost 3. So, n=3 layers. Then, according to the formula, L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. But when I compute step by step, I get 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps my formula is off by one. Let me check again. When I derived the formula, I considered L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. So, for n=1, L_1=4; n=2, L_2=13; n=3, L_3=40. But in the smaller problem, with three layers, I end up with 39, not 40. Wait, that suggests a problem. Let me compute the smaller problem again. Let me write it out: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute the innermost first: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. Wait, no, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute step by step: Start with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Compute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. But when I first thought about it, I thought the outermost expression was 3*(1 + 3*...), but in reality, it's 3*(Layer 3), where Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40=120. Alternatively, using the formula, L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, then 3*40=120. So, that's correct. Wait, but earlier when I thought I got 39, I must have miscalculated. Let me check: If I compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), that's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. So, correct. Therefore, the formula works, and my initial step-by-step approach was correct, leading to 87572 for the original problem. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in the final answer of 87572.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524) = 476. So, 3*29524 = 90000 - (3*476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. But just for practice, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula here. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). The homogeneous solution is Layer n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, earlier I got 87572, now I'm thinking 88572. Which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, the digits are 2,9,5,2,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had 87572. I must have miscalculated before. So the correct multiplication is 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.

Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, there are nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, layers 1 through 9, as I did before. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the problem is solved correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1.

So the result is 87,572. But when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 24 + 24 = 48, 25 + 25 = 50, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 20000 + 20000 = 40000. Wait, that's not the right way to add.

Let's add them: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8, carry 0. 9 + 0 = 9, write 9. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Therefore, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So my initial digit-by-digit method had an error, probably because I miscounted the digits. So the correct result is 88,572.

Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the computation is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but our a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the general term is a_n = 2*3^n + 1 or something else. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\na_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n-2*a_p = 1\na_p = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\n(3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\n(3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds for each layer.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:**\n   The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recast the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each layer again to be thorough.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), so each time, we're adding one more layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, which I accounted for in Layers 1 through 9. Therefore, the computation seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication at the end. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.
