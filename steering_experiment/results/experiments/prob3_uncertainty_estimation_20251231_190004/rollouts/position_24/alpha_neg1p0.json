So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.  So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3(...): Starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, starting with the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer 1, then each 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which itself has another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times I see a \"1+3(\" in the expression. Each time I see \"1+3(\", it's a new layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each time there's another \"1+3(\", so let's count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. But in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, the expression is 3 times Layer 9, so that should be correct. Let me confirm by writing down each layer again with their computed values:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is correctly computed, and the multiplication by 3 at the end is accurate. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer's result. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3.

Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3.

So, the final computation is: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: I can break this down. 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way because 29524 is 29,000 + 524. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute them incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me see if there's a formula that can be applied here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me recall the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum S of n terms where each term is multiplied by a common ratio r is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term. But in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, it's more like a recursive formula. Let me define each layer as follows: Let a_n be the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think this makes sense. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous +1. Let me see if that approach gives the same result. Starting with 4: Layer 2: 3*4 +1=13. Layer 3:3*13 +1=40. Layer 4:3*40 +1=121. Layer 5:3*121 +1=364. Layer 6:3*364 +1=1093. Layer 7:3*1093 +1=3280. Layer 8:3*3280 +1=9841. Layer 9:3*9841 +1=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, the final computation is: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3.

Wait a second, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to mix up the numbers. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it more efficiently, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Let me verify that multiplication again: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from 1, each time you add 3 times the previous term. Wait, that sounds like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Hmm, but actually, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524*3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can express this as a recurrence relation. Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, we can see that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps there's a closed-form formula for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's try to find the closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for a_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form expression, the total expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get 88572 as the result. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same number, so I'm confident that 88572 is the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 is definitely 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, that's correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; adding those up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; adding up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; adding up: 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Finally, the outermost operation: 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. Starting from the innermost, Layer 1 was 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Since the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, that means there are nine layers, right? Let me count the number of times I added a layer: Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, Layer 4, Layer 5, Layer 6, Layer 7, Layer 8, Layer 9. Yep, that's nine layers. So, I think I did that correctly. Each time, I computed the innermost layer first and worked my way outward. It's important to make sure that each step is correct because if I made a mistake in one layer, it would carry over to all the subsequent layers and the final answer. So, double-checking each computation was a good idea. Let me just verify a couple of the layers again to be sure. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 is 1 + 29523, which is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it step by step helped me manage it without getting lost. I guess another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one step by step was feasible. If it were a larger number, maybe I could find a formula or pattern, but for nine layers, this approach worked fine.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

So, for n=2, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 12=13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40, which is correct. So, this seems to hold. Now, since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, no, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term, so the homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3C => C = 1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost layer is a_9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That's the same as I got before when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. I computed each layer up to the 9th, which gave me 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, so that gives me more confidence. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. So, I think I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\).

Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29524 should be 88572, right? Wait, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be growing exponentially. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. I recall that expressions like this, where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, can be represented as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer results in 29524.

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Yes, that's correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error in the earlier calculations. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it without going through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + D => 4 = 3C + D. Now, let's find the steady-state solution by setting a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Then, D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D =1 => D = -1/2. Hmm, that seems a bit odd because our terms are all integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say D. Plugging into the equation: D = 1 + 3D => -2D =1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. I went through each step carefully, and both the iterative approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence gives the closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait a second, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations because each step depends on the previous one, so a small mistake early on could throw off the entire result. Starting again from Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct.) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct.) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Yes, that's right.) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Still correct.) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct.) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Yes, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (3*1093 is indeed 3279, plus 1 is 3280.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.) Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems consistent. Hmm, but just to make sure I didn't miss a layer. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's count: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 (Layer 1) Then, each step out adds another layer. So, the expression has 9 layers, as I initially thought. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let's parse it:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3(...\n2. 1 + 3(...\n3. 1 + 3(...\n4. 1 + 3(...\n5. 1 + 3(...\n6. 1 + 3(...\n7. 1 + 3(...\n8. 1 + 3(...\n9. 1 + 3(...\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 is the outermost layer, which we've already computed as 29524, leading to 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern initially, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also gave me the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). \n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis looks similar to a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it more efficiently instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find the solution.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1.\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nYes, this formula works.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3L_9. So, let's see if there's a recursive formula here. Each L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}. Let's substitute n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3L_0. But wait, L_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the recurrence starting from L_1. Let me rearrange the recurrence: L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3D = 1 \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Let's take n=1: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me consider the innermost layer again. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I expand it, the total expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Let's say we have L layers. Then, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with L layers. Each expansion adds another term. Let's see for L=1: 3*(1) = 3. For L=2: 3*(1 + 3*1) = 3*(4) = 12. For L=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13=39. Wait, but in our problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with nine layers, which is L=9. So, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of 3^{k} terms. Let me think about it. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. If I expand this, E = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with eight layers. Wait, that seems recursive. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of it as E = 3*(1 + E'), where E' is the expression with one fewer layer. But since we have nine layers, maybe we can write a general formula for E_n, where E_n is the expression with n layers. Then, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 3*(1) = 3. Let's see if this aligns with the earlier approach. For n=1: E_1=3. For n=2: E_2=3*(1 + E_1)=3*(1 +3)=3*4=12. For n=3: E_3=3*(1 + E_2)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 3, I got 40, but here E_3 is 39. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers here. Let me clarify. In the initial approach, each layer L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=88572. But in this E_n approach, E_n=3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=3. Let me compute E_n for n=1 to 9 using this recurrence and see what happens. E_1=3. E_2=3*(1 + E_1)=3*(1+3)=12. E_3=3*(1 + E_2)=3*(1+12)=39. E_4=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. E_5=3*(1 +120)=3*121=363. E_6=3*(1 +363)=3*364=1092. E_7=3*(1 +1092)=3*1093=3279. E_8=3*(1 +3279)=3*3280=9840. E_9=3*(1 +9840)=3*9841=29523. Wait a minute, so E_9=29523. But in the initial approach, the total expression was 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. But here, E_9=29523, which is one less than L_9=29524. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see. In the initial approach, L_n represents the innermost expression at each layer, starting from L_1=4. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. In the E_n approach, E_n represents the entire expression with n layers, so E_9 would be the total expression, which is 3*(1 + E_8). But according to the initial computation, E_9=29523, which is exactly L_9=29524 minus 1. So, perhaps there's a shift in the indices. Let me check. If L_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=88572. On the other hand, E_n=3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1=3. Let's see what E_n equals in terms of L_n. From the initial approach, L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}. Now, E_n=3*(1 + E_{n-1})=3 +3*E_{n-1}. Comparing with L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}, we can see that E_n=3 +3*E_{n-1}=3*(1 + E_{n-1}), which is similar but scaled by 3. Let me see if I can relate E_n to L_n. Let me write E_n=3*(1 + E_{n-1}). Let me expand E_n: E_n=3 +3*E_{n-1}. Similarly, L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}. Let me try to express E_n in terms of L_n. Suppose E_n=3*(L_{n} - something). Let me see. Let me compute E_1=3. L_1=4. So, E_1=3=3*(L_1 -1). Because L_1=4, 3*(4-1)=9, which is not equal to E_1=3. Hmm, that doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe E_n= L_{n} -1. Let's check: For n=1: E_1=3, L_1=4, so 4 -1=3. Correct. For n=2: E_2=12, L_2=13, so 13 -1=12. Correct. For n=3: E_3=39, L_3=40, so 40 -1=39. Correct. So, it seems that E_n= L_n -1. Therefore, since E_n= L_n -1, then L_n= E_n +1. Now, the total expression we're trying to compute is 3*L_9=3*(E_9 +1)=3*E_9 +3. From the E_n approach, E_9=29523, so 3*E_9 +3=3*29523 +3=88569 +3=88572. Which matches the initial result. So, both methods are consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

So, the final step is: Final result: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The closed-form solution we found is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Thus, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say, instead of 9 layers, let's take 2 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1))) Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, using the formula: n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Then, 3*a_2=39. Correct. Another test: 3 layers. Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1)))) Innermost: 1+3=4; next layer: 1+3*4=13; next layer: 1 + 3*13=40; then 3*40=120. Using the formula: n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases, so it's likely correct for n=9 as well. Therefore, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we determine that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression: It's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step would be: Total = 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3.

Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the result is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the manual computation. Let me think about this expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is being added after multiplying by 3. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. Hmm, so this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

However, if this were a much deeper expression, I might look for a geometric series or some other pattern to find a closed-form solution. But for now, step-by-step computation works fine.\n\nWait, another thought: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a term in a geometric sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same result. This confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same answer. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct solution.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation as I went.\n\n3. Notice the recurrence relation pattern and derive a formula to compute the nth layer directly.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer, then multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations to simplify computation. It also reinforced the importance of verifying results through multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the final step would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- 3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 3 * 9 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nWait, hold on, maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carry over 2 is written as 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, let me correct that:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, all the layers compute correctly, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me see if there's a formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2*K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, each layer a_n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method also leads to the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might also help. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to expanding a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more of a recursive geometric progression rather than a simple sum of a series. However, the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation is more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to notice that each layer is essentially building up powers of 3. For example, layer 1 is 4 = 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Wait a minute, this seems like a pattern where each layer is the sum of a geometric series up to a certain power of 3.\n\nIndeed, for layer n, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. But wait, let's check that:\n\nFor layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the closed-form solution we found earlier. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nSo, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the sum of a geometric series\u2014we arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify the multiplication step again. 29524 multiplied by 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series. The final computation results in the value 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Another one: Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Okay, I feel confident that each step is accurate. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Right.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Yep.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Right.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait a minute, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me check 3*29524 again. 29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or a formula. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is generated by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3(...) appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3(, we have 9 opening parentheses: each 1+3( is a new layer. So, there are 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in terms of the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my initial step-by-step calculation was correct, and using the formula for the linear recurrence also gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can use the formula for a linear recurrence relation to find the value of each layer efficiently. \n\nThe solution involves computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and then using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation to find the value of the outermost layer. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the innermost term \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Find the General Formula:**\n   The recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the layer number.\n\n3. **Compute the Outermost Layer:**\n   Since there are 9 layers, the outermost term \\( a_9 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That's similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3 =1 +3*a_2=40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 =0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2. So, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this value, so 3*29524=88572. So, both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a general formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a formula derived from a linear recurrence relation. The final value of the outermost layer is 29,524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if that approach works. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation\u2014gave me the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. \n\nContinuing this process up to Layer 9, we find that Layer 9 equals 29,524. Finally, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572, but let me verify with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's multiply each digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in one of the earlier computations. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, all layers are correct up to Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, which might help verify the result without computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually as I did earlier is feasible. However, for better understanding, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2713\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2713\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2713\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2713\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2713\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2713\nFor n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2713\nFor n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2713\nFor n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2713\n\nPerfect! The formula works for all layers. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see: The expression inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Each time, we're adding another 3^n term. So, expanding the entire expression might give a sum of powers of 3. Let's try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nContinuing this pattern, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but that's not exactly the case because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which effectively adds another term. However, when we multiply by 3 each time, it's more like a geometric progression with each term being 3 times the previous. Let me think again.\n\nActually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote S_n as the sum up to the nth layer, then S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}. Which is similar to the recurrence relation we had earlier. So, solving this recurrence gives S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as before. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to recognize that the entire expression is a finite geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, each term is multiplied by 3, so r=3. The first term when fully expanded would be 1, and each subsequent term is 3 times the previous. However, since the expression is nested, the number of terms isn't immediately obvious. But using the closed-form solution we derived earlier, we can see that it's equivalent to (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is the sum of the series up to 3^9.\n\nWait, let me clarify that. If I expand the entire expression, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but that's actually the sum S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. But in our problem, the expression is 3*(S_9), so it's 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Exactly the same result as before. So, that's another way to arrive at the same answer, confirming that it's correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this from multiple angles: computing each layer step by step, deriving a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, and recognizing the expression as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result of 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the closed-form formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine the total value to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. This forms a geometric progression.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, I can do 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it together: 7 7 8 5 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait a second, let me just verify each step because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that formula. Actually, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - r*a_{n-1} = c. The characteristic equation is k = r*k, which gives k = 0 or k = 1. Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, the general solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me test this formula. Let's set a_0 = 1 (the initial term). Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Using the formula: a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). So, a_n = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's compute a_1: 3^1 + (3^1 -1)/2 = 3 + (3 -1)/2 = 3 + 1 = 4. Correct. a_2: 3^2 + (3^2 -1)/2 = 9 + (9 -1)/2 = 9 + 4 = 13. Correct. a_3: 3^3 + (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 + (27 -1)/2 = 27 + 13 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that's a neat formula. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around it. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, n=9. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=40. Correct. n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=121. Correct. n=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=364. Correct. n=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093. Correct. n=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280. Correct. n=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841. Correct. n=9: a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Correct. So, each layer checks out with the formula. Thus, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3.\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. It's easy to miscount the layers or make an arithmetic error. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as we had before. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct again. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the layers.

But let me check if the layers are correct because 9 layers seem like a lot, and the numbers are growing rapidly. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 parts. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the left: 1. 3(1+3(2. 1+3(3. 1+3(4. 1+3(5. 1+3(6. 1+3(7. 1+3(8. 1+3(9. 1+3)))))))))))) So, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before the closing parentheses start. That means there are 9 layers. So, my initial computation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the final value is 88572. Wait, but let me verify with a different approach because the number seems quite large. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3 * previous_layer. So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It looks like each layer is following a geometric progression. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence to find a general formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 *29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked using a recurrence relation and a formula, which gave me the same result as computing each layer step by step. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 29524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, carry over 7. 2 * 3 = 6 + 7 = 13, carry over 1. 5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, let me verify my calculations for each layer because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake in one of the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 +120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Now, the final step: 3 * 29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4 *3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that's 88572. Wait, but when I write it down, it's 29524 *3: 29524 \u00d7 3: 4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1. 2\u00d73=6 +1=7. 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1. 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2\u00d73=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can check 29524 \u00d73 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add them. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 +9000=88048, 88048 +524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I went through each layer step by step, making sure each computation was accurate, and then verified the final multiplication. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3. The step-by-step computation confirms that the final answer is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 52 * 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163, write down 3 and carry over 16. 95 * 3 = 285, plus 16 is 301, write down 1 and carry over 30. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 30 is 36. So, writing it all together: 36,1572? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again. 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems better. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step, just to be certain. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I need to check the exact form. Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29,524) = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Correct. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.
