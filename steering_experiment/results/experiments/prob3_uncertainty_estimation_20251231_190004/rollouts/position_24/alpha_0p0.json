    "text": " Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Maybe I can compute each layer up to Layer 9 and then multiply by the outermost 3. Let me try to compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. That seems like a lot of layers. Let me check how many layers there actually are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can do 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes, when doing repetitive calculations, it's easy to slip up. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all layers check out. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n=1, a1=4; n=2, a2=13; n=3, a3=40; and so on. I can try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, I can express this as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Okay, that's manageable. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going.

It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify with a different approach to be absolutely sure. Another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I got earlier. Now, to find the general formula, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. To find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think this confirms that the initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method to avoid mistakes, especially with such large numbers. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a general formula for each layer, confirming that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me do that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

    "text": " Okay, that's manageable. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, okay, so each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a trend. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Okay, so the outermost layer is Layer 9, which equals 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that outermost layer, right? Because the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, so is that the final answer? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but let me check Layer 9 again. If Layer 8 is 9841, then 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, to find a formula for a_n, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand it all the way, it's a sum of 1's multiplied by powers of 3. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, and so on. So, each layer adds another term which is 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each time. So, for 9 layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^8, but multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, no, actually, it's a bit different. Because each layer is multiplied by 3, it's more like a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think again. If I have a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, but earlier, we had a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check that: For n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = 4, which is 1 + 3. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9. So, indeed, a_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but wait, 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, that matches our formula. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, is 88572 the final answer? Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. That seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Divided by 2:59,048 /2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29,524=88,572. So, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially when computing 3^10. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59,049 -1=59,048; 59,048/2=29,524. Then, 29,524*3: 29,524*3. Let me compute that again: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+72=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a general formula helped ensure that I didn't make any mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 29,000 * 3 = 87,000; 524 * 3 = 1,572. So, 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate. Let me recount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, the computation I did earlier should be correct. Each layer is built on the previous one, and I computed each step correctly. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's solid now. I didn't make any mistakes in my manual calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same answer. So, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 3*29524. I can break this down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression should be 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, which would throw off all the subsequent layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me more confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

So, let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, left side: A*3^{n} + B, right side: A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1 using the formula: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2. We know a_1 = 4, so: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as before. So, the formula seems to hold. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, interesting. Let me keep going to see if I can spot a pattern.

Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, the innermost parentheses are 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, and so on, until Layer 9: 1+3*(previous layer). But in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, once I compute Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3 to get the final result. Let me recap the layers I computed:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.

Hmm, same number, just written differently. So, 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29,524. Let's compute that:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn the original problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series. Each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The closed-form formula we derived is consistent with that.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to expand the entire expression. Let me try that. Let's see what the original expression looks like when fully expanded. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand each layer, it's going to be a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 3*(previous sum) +1.\n\nBut when fully expanded, each term is 3^k, where k is the number of multiplications. Let me see:\n\nEach time we go out a layer, we're effectively adding another 3^k term.\n\nWait, actually, when I compute a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, that's similar to the sum of a geometric series: sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in this case, a_n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n. So, each a_n is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^n.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is that the entire expression is 3 times the sum of 3^0 to 3^9, which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I've checked it multiple ways, and each method gives the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous result. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that this structure is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 =4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.

So, yes, it's 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with all these layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.

Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. So, we can write this as a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 =0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in either approach, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The associated homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer up to Layer 9 is a_9=29524. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think this confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. So, the answer should be 88572. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, each layer's value is being used in the next layer, and by working step by step, I can compute each layer without getting lost. I think this approach works because each layer is dependent on the previous one, so starting from the inside ensures that each subsequent layer has the correct value to compute with. It might seem tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step makes it manageable. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a couple of layers to check. Let's pick Layer 5 and Layer 7.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, let's compute that: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572? Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should do it more carefully. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29,524 * 3: 30,000 *3=90,000. But 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476*3)=90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the layers. Let me check Layer 7 again: Layer 6 is 1093. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840+1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841. 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*41=123. So, 27,000+2,400=29,400 +123=29,523. Then, 29,523 +1=29,524. Correct. So, 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer step by step. Each layer seems to follow the pattern of a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can find another condition by considering the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, we can solve it iteratively. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1=4=3^1 +1=4\na_2=1 +3*4=13=3^2 + 3 +1=9+3+1=13\na_3=1 +3*13=40=3^3 + 3^2 +3 +1=27+9+3+1=40\na_4=1 +3*40=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=81+27+9+3+1=121\nSo, it seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. So, I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer after verifying each step and even finding a general formula for the layers. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but breaking it down step by step helped me avoid mistakes. I also checked my work by deriving a formula, which gave me the same result as the step-by-step computation. So, I'm pretty sure that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct). Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step manually is feasible. Another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly and then apply the formula. But since I've already computed it step by step, and both methods give the same result, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently to confirm the result. Another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the structure. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). If I let a_n represent the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as per Layer 2. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct again. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value should be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches Layer 9 as I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...). There are nine \"1+3(\" before the last closing parenthesis. So, that's nine layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, my earlier calculation is correct, with a_9 being the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer's value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering the multiple layers of multiplication, it makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, Layer 2 would be a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which also matches. Similarly, Layer 3 is (81 - 1)/2 = 40, correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our previous calculation. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. But wait, just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time wrapping with 1+3(...). The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each time we have 1+3(, so from the first 3, how many layers? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears: 1. 3(1+3(2. 1+3(3. 1+3(4. 1+3(5. 1+3(6. 1+3(7. 1+3(8. 1+3(9. 1+3(10. 1+3( But wait, the innermost is 1+3), so maybe I'm overcounting. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" from the start: 1. 3(1+3(2. 1+3(3. 1+3(4. 1+3(5. 1+3(6. 1+3(7. 1+3(8. 1+3(9. 1+3(10. 1+3(11. 1+3(12. 1+3(13. 1+3(14. 1+3(15. 1+3(16. 1+3(17. 1+3(18. 1+3(19. 1+3(20. 1+3(21. 1+3(22. 1+3(23. 1+3(24. 1+3(25. 1+3(26. 1+3(27. 1+3(28. 1+3(29. 1+3(30. 1+3(31. 1+3(32. 1+3(33. 1+3(34. 1+3(35. 1+3(36. 1+3(37. 1+3(38. 1+3(39. 1+3(40. 1+3(41. 1+3(42. 1+3(43. 1+3(44. 1+3(45. 1+3(46. 1+3(47. 1+3(48. 1+3(49. 1+3(50. 1+3( Wait, that can't be right. I must be miscounting. Alternatively, maybe I should just accept that I counted 9 layers because the problem has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me look again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first is 3(\n- Then inside, 1+3(\n- Then another 1+3(\n- And so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3(, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" before the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, actually, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" increases the layer count by one. Let me try to count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nFrom the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\", that's Layer 1, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" are there:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 10 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. But the innermost is 1+3), so maybe the number of layers is 9. Let me see: Each time I have a \"1+3(\", it's a new layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3). Then each time wrapping out, it's Layer 2, Layer 3, etc., up to Layer 9. So, perhaps I did compute 9 layers correctly. Therefore, my initial calculation of 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n. Let's see, since each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier calculations. For n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

So, I think my answer is correct. I can also try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I calculated earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, the innermost Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, and the outermost Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 is (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, the layers are correct, 9 layers, each time 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my calculation should be correct. But let me verify the multiplication steps again, just to be sure. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. So, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) is a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 1+3, each time we have a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, n=9, so a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I didn't want to compute each layer, I could have used the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, which we found to be a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Then, since there are 9 layers, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 1) equals 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing all 9 layers, the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, maybe. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n = 2 to 9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Divide by 2: 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which is the same as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, writing it down: 29,524 *3 = 88,572. That matches what I had before. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n=4, each layer is 1 + 3n. Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something. Let's denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number. So, a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on up to a9. Then, the total expression is 3*a9. Hmm, maybe I can find a formula for a_i in terms of a1. Let me try to write a recurrence relation. a_i = 1 + 3a_{i-1}, with a1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_i - 3a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^i. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_i = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with i=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. i=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. i=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. It's a bit more advanced, but it confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1, it's a bit different. But using the recurrence relation helped me find a closed-form solution, which is neat.

So, let's compute that: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct).

So, 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can check by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. It's a pretty big number, but considering how many layers there are, it makes sense.

Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, adding up the products: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Yep, that matches. So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one, a small error in one layer could propagate all the way out. Let me recompute the layers step by step again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_2 =1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't recall the formula for such a recurrence, I could have noticed the pattern in the layers: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence, and by computing the first few terms, I might have spotted the pattern that each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. But since I derived it, it's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms the result. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outer Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."
