    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can approach this. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last one: 1+3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. Each level is 1 plus 3 times the previous result, right? \n\nLet me write this down step by step to keep track:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next level out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364. 3*364, let me compute that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly.\n\nWait, 29524 is the number. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*(20000) = 60000,\n\n3*(9000) = 27000,\n\n3*(500) = 1500,\n\n3*(20) = 60,\n\n3*(4) = 12.\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000,\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500,\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560,\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify each step because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere.\n\nLet me go back and check each step:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I got the same result. So, that seems right.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's see:\n\n29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3, which is 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Let me go through each step again quickly:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but given that each step is just 1 + 3 times the previous, it's a simple recursive computation. So, working from the inside out is the way to go.\n\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Substitute back into the next level:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Continue substituting and simplifying each level:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply by 3:  \n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. So, the innermost part is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that with another 1+3 times the previous result.\n\nLet me try to tackle this step by step. Maybe I'll start from the innermost part and move outwards, calculating each layer as I go.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40.\n\nCalculating: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121.\n\nCalculating: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So, 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculating: 3*364. Hmm, let's see, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again because 3*9841 might be better done another way. Let me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9841\n*    3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, which is the entire expression multiplied by 3. So, the final step is:\n\n10. 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but maybe it's easier to compute digit by digit.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3 * 2 = 6\n\n3 * 9 = 27, write down 7 and carry over 2.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n3 * 0 = 0, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so actually, the digits are:\n\nPosition: 10,000: 2\n\n1,000: 9\n\n100: 5\n\n10: 2\n\n1: 4\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, but that would be 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me list each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one correctly. So, I think I did this right. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are multiple layers of 3 multiplied by something in parentheses. Each time, the structure is similar: 3 times (1 plus another similar expression). Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside, it'll be manageable.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 3 times (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 3.\n\nWait, let me parse this correctly. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write down each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's denote each nested expression as E1, E2, ..., up to E9, since there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer. Then each layer wraps around it with 3*(1 + ...). So, let's compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define E9 as the innermost expression:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E8 = 1 + 3*E9\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nAnd so on, until E1, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*E1.\n\nWait, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(E1), where E1 is 1 + 3*(E2), and so on. So, starting from E9, let's compute each Ei step by step.\n\nSo, let's start:\n\nCompute E9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen E8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E1 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from E9:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check some of the steps to ensure I didn't make any multiplication errors.\n\nLet's recompute E5 to E1:\n\nE5: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4: 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3: 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2: 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE1: 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me define the sequence recursively. Let\u2019s say that each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i+1), starting from E9 = 4.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see it as a recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, since each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, we can model this as a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Each time, we're doing E = 1 + 3*E_prev, where E_prev is the previous layer.\n\nBut actually, in this case, each E is built from the next one, so perhaps it's better to model it as a sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the expression step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and we have 9 layers, maybe we can find a general formula.\n\nWait, let me consider that each layer adds another term in a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let's consider that each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i+1), starting from E9 = 4.\n\nSo, E8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as E = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf we have a recurrence relation where each term is E = 1 + 3*E_prev, starting from E = 4.\n\nWait, that's similar to E = 1 + 3*E_prev, which is a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me set up the recurrence:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}\n\nBut wait, in our case, each E is built from the next one, so perhaps it's better to reverse the indices.\n\nLet me define E_1 as the innermost, which is 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as E_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let's check.\n\nWait, for n=1, E1=4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4, so that works.\n\nWait, n=1: E1=4 = (3^{2} -1)/2\n\nn=2: E2=13 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E3=40 = (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: E4=121 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: E5=364 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: E6=1093 = (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: E7=3280 = (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: E8=9841 = (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: E9=29524 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWow, that's a neat pattern! So, each E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, E1=(3^2 -1)/2=4\n\nn=2, E2=(3^3 -1)/2=13\n\nAnd so on, up to E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*E9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nTherefore, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it: the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also found a pattern that confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, revealing a pattern that allows the final result to be expressed as a geometric series. The final computation confirms the result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost part, each layer adds another 1+3(...) structure. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine layers here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times something. \n\nMaybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That seems like a good strategy because each step will depend on the result of the previous one. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3\n   That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n   So, 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n   So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n   So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n   So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n   So, 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n   So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n   So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n   So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that again. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: Let me compute that again. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's break it down again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing the innermost part all the way out to 29524, the problem is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, that's not the right breakdown. Let me correct that. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number, but let me check it again.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the innermost expression evaluates to 4, each subsequent layer builds up, and finally, the entire expression inside the last parentheses is 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives us 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3, I think there are nine layers. Let me count again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...1))\n\n3. (1+3(...2))\n\n4. (1+3(...3))\n\n5. (1+3(...4))\n\n6. (1+3(...5))\n\n7. (1+3(...6))\n\n8. (1+3(...7))\n\n9. (1+3(...8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(...9). So, yes, nine layers inside, then multiplied by 3. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time, I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*      3\n\n= ?\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I double-checked the multiplications to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572  \n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, let's rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me start there.\n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. Let me write that down.\n\nNext level out: 3(1 + 3(...)) where the inner part is now 4. Wait, actually, let me be precise.\n\nWait, no, the structure is more like 3(1 + 3(...)). So the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out one level, we have 3 times that 4, but wait, no, actually, it's 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should number each level to keep track.

Wait, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each level is 1 + 3*(next level).

Let me list each level from the innermost outwards.\n\nLet me define each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each step starting from the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one level, we have 3*(innermost result). Wait, no, wait. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each level is 3*(1 + 3*(next level)).

It was 9 times, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is level 1, then 3*(1 + level1) is level2, then 3*(1 + level2) is level3, and so on until level9.\n\nWait, so if I have 9 levels, then the final result would be level9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by computing each level step by step, carefully.\n\nLet me list each level:\n\nLevel1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Each level is computed by taking 3 times (1 plus the previous level). So starting from 4, each subsequent level is 3*(1 + previous level). After 9 levels, we reach 36084.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI notice that each level is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo that's the same as before. It seems that each term is growing exponentially.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this recurrence relation in a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a1 = 4.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3A - 3/2\n\nSo, 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2, so 8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2\n\nSimilarly, -3/2 is just a constant.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nAlternatively, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1.\n\na1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 -3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*3^{1} -3)/2 = (33 -3)/2 = 30/2 =15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*9 -3)/2 = (99 -3)/2 = 96/2 =48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11*27 -3)/2 = (297 -3)/2 =294/2=147. Correct.\n\nn=5: (11*81 -3)/2 = (891 -3)/2=888/2=444. Correct.\n\nn=6: (11*243 -3)/2= (2673 -3)/2=2670/2=1335. Correct.\n\nn=7: (11*729 -3)/2= (8019 -3)/2=8016/2=4008. Correct.\n\nn=8: (11*2187 -3)/2= (24057 -3)/2=24054/2=12027. Correct.\n\nn=9: (11*6561 -3)/2= (72171 -3)/2=72168/2=36084. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9=36084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more by computing each step manually, to ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext level: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5=15\n\nNext: 3*(1 +15)=3*16=48\n\nNext: 3*(1 +48)=3*49=147\n\nNext: 3*(1 +147)=3*148=444\n\nNext: 3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027\n\nNext: 3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the result is indeed 36084.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula derived from the recurrence relation also confirms it. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, simplifying each step as we go. Each level is computed by multiplying 3 with the result of (1 + the previous level). After simplifying each level step by step, we find that the final result is 36084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. **Next Level Out:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 4) = 3 * 5 = 15\n\n3. **Next Level:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 15) = 3 * 16 = 48\n\n4. **Next Level:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 48) = 3 * 49 = 147\n\n5. **Next Level:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 147) = 3 * 148 = 444\n\n6. **Next Level:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 444) = 3 * 445 = 1335\n\n7. **Next Level:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 1335) = 3 * 1336 = 4008\n\n8. **Next Level:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 4008) = 3 * 4009 = 12027\n\n9. **Outermost Level:**\n   - 3 * (1 + 12027) = 3 * 12028 = 36084\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{36084}"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions like this.\n\nAlright, let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on, until the outermost one. I think there are nine layers here. Wait, actually, let me check:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, actually, maybe I miscounted. Let me look again. Each time I have a \"1 + 3(...)\", so starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So if I have 1+3(1+3(...)), how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the original problem, after the first 3(, the first inner expression is 1+3(1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4.

So maybe the number of layers is 8? Because the first one is just 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3, then layer 2: 1 + 3(1 + 3), layer 3: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), and so on, until layer 9: the outermost one, which is 3(...). Wait, no, because the outermost is 3 times the whole expression, so the layers inside are 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it out step by step. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression as E1, E2, ..., E8, where E1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, let me think: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So let me start by computing the innermost expression and work my way out.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until E8, and then the outermost is 3*E8.\n\nWait, actually, let me check: the original expression is 3*(E), where E is 1 + 3*(F), and F is 1 + 3*(G), and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, perhaps there are 8 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3*(.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, but actually, the outermost is 3*(...), so the inner expression has 8 layers of 1 + 3(...).

So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as E1 to E8, where E1 is the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*E8, so:\n\n3*E8 = 3*9841 = Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute 9841 * 3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdd them up:\n\n27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 29,523.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

It seems like each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let me write down the expression again to get a clearer picture:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). That's the ninth level, I think. Let me count the number of 3s or the number of operations. Wait, each time it's 3 multiplied by something, so maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me try to compute from the inside out. Let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4.\n\nThen, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the next level out is 13. Now, moving out another level, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlright, so now the next level is 40. Let me write down each step as I go:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3.

Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here.\n\nFirst, Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 * 3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, 29400 + 120=29520, 29520 + 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524.\n\nAs before, 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3=60000\n\n9000 * 3=27000\n\n500 * 3=1500\n\n24 * 3=72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000=87000, 87000 + 1500=88500, 88500 +72=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that it's only 9 levels deep, computing each step manually might be more straightforward. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at each level, each time we're computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent level is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can find a general formula for a_n in terms of a_1.\n\nRecurrence relations of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nIn this case, c=1, r=3.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r - 1)).\n\nWait, let me recall: For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r - 1)).\n\nSo, in this case, r=3, c=1.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (1)/(3 - 1) = A*3^n + 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 1/2.\n\nSubtract 1/2: 4 - 1/2 = 3A => 7/2 = 3A => A = (7/2)/3 = 7/6.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (7*3^n)/6 + 1/2 = (7*3^n + 3)/6.\n\nWait, because 1/2 = 3/6, so:\n\na_n = (7*3^n + 3)/6.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (7*3 + 3)/6 = (21 + 3)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (7*9 + 3)/6 = (63 + 3)/6 = 66/6 = 11. Wait, but from earlier, a_2 was 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong with my formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nWait, let's check again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, so the formula I derived gave a_2=11, which is incorrect. So, my general formula must be wrong.\n\nLet me try to derive it again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolve for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, that works. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 levels, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula, let me compute a_5 using the formula:\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier computation \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSimilarly, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\na_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, I can be confident that the value of the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down the expression step by step:\n\n1.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading that correctly. The next part is 1 + 3( something ). So, the something is the result we just got, which is 4.\n\nSo, substituting that in, the next expression becomes:\n\n1 + 3(4)\n\nNow, I need to compute that. Let's compute the multiplication first, as per order of operations.\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nSo, now the expression becomes:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that simplifies the next level to 13. Now, moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3 times this new result. So, let's substitute 13 into the next level.\n\nSo, the next expression is:\n\n1 + 3(13)\n\nAgain, compute the multiplication first.\n\n3 * 13 = 39\n\nThen, add 1:\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so now we're at 40. Let me see, this seems to be a pattern where each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. Let me check if that's consistent.\n\nWait, so each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, okay, so each time we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next level. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nSo, let's go step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, let me count how many levels there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level, and then the outermost is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of innermost (1 + 3) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis brings us back a level. Let's count the number of times (1 + 3) occurs:\n\nFrom the inside out, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times, because each time we have an opening parenthesis, except the very first one.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have (1 + 3(...)), and each time we go one level out. So, let's count how many innermost (1 + 3) there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, there's another 3(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many times does (1 + 3) appear as the innermost?\n\nLet me see: Each time you have a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3(...)) where ... is the previous one.\n3. So, how many levels? Let me count the number of 3s before each (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that the expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, that would mean there are 9 levels of (1 + 3(...)), each time building upon the previous result, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Level 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3(...)), we have that value, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524:\n\nDigits are: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, 29524 is:\n\n2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying each by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps because it's easy to get lost in the nesting.\n\nLet me recompute each level step by step:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each level correctly builds upon the previous one, and the multiplication at the end gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with all the nested expressions, but breaking it down step by step helps prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward, each time computing the result of 1 + 3 times the previous result. After reaching the outermost parentheses, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Substitute and compute each subsequent level:\n   - 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the final result by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, okay, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3).

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and that happens eight times. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number them from inside out:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, I have to multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let me summarize the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, it's another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the structure is:\n\n3( A ), where A is (1 + 3(B)), and B is (1 + 3(C)), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time you have a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen, wrapping around that: (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, each time, you have another layer.\n\nLet me see, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is a (1 + 3(...)), and the number of such layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 more layers.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), which is 1 + 3*(...). Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does \"3(\" appear? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The first 3 is outside, then each (1 + 3(...) is a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"3(\" appears after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, each time, a new layer is added. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is the start of the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another ( after 3, and so on.\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, meaning there are 8 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed the layers earlier, I went up to Layer 9, but that might have included the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLet me try again, carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Each layer is one more step, starting from the innermost, so there are 9 layers in total, with the outermost being the multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so there are 8 more layers after that.\n\nWait, so Layer 1 is (1 + 3), Layer 2 is the next one, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total, with the final result being 3 times Layer 9.\n\nSo, computing each layer step by step, as I did earlier, gives me Layer 9 as 29,524, and then 3 times that is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me verify each layer's calculation again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, multiplying 29,524 by 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that also gives the same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it in a different way, like using the distributive property or looking for a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis method also confirms the result, so I'm even more confident now.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn conclusion, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and cross-checking the calculations, I'm certain that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, the key is to start from the innermost part and work your way outwards. So, I'll start by identifying the innermost expression and then move outward, simplifying each layer as I go.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's a series of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together, with each layer being multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Let me note down each step as I go.\n\nFirst, let's denote the innermost expression as level 1:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3) multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Hmm, let me check that.\n\nWait, looking at the expression again, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3), then moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, no, maybe I should parse it correctly. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost (1+3), and each time we have another layer around it, so let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so each time we go up a level, we're adding another 1 plus 3 times the previous result, then multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me start by labeling each level from the innermost to the outermost. Let's count the number of layers:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's level 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer, so let's see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are 9 layers here because each (1+3) is nested 9 times. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times (1+3) appears inside:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so let's count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2 is 3*(1 + L1)\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each layer is 3*(1 + next_layer). Wait, maybe I should write it as:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(next step). Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + the next inner layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check that I'm not making a mistake here. Let me make sure that each layer is correctly calculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each step with more care.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original problem has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times we have a (1 + 3(...)) structure.\n\nLooking back, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), each time we go out, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer after 3 is (1 + 3*(...))\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times we have (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLet me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then moving out, each time it's (1 + 3*(...)), so starting from (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + ...), which would be layer 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that each time we go out a layer, we add another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, then the final result would be Layer9: 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step, I'm adding 1 to the previous result and then multiplying by 3. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*(1 + A)\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 3 + 3A\n\nA - 3A = 3\n\n-2A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\n11/2 = 3C\n\nC = 11/(2*3) = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as L_n = (11*3^{n-1} ) - 3/2, but let me check with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\nL_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, L_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 \u00f7 6: 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3280.5 * 10 = 32805\n\n3280.5 * 1 = 3280.5\n\nAdding together: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, L_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step calculation I did earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the step-by-step approach. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with the result of the inner expression plus 1. By iteratively applying this process, each layer's value is determined until the outermost layer is reached. \n\nThe step-by-step computation is as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 147\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 444\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 1335\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 4008\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12027\\)\n9. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 36084\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\boxed{36084}"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part here is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3(...). Since the innermost one is 4, the next one would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing that right. So, each time, we're taking the result of the innermost expression, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. So, yeah, 1 + 3*(previous result). That seems correct.\n\nLet me try to write down each step clearly to avoid confusion. I'll start from the innermost and work my way out.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me see how many times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is wrapped in another \"1+3*(...)\" until the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\nWait, now I'm getting a different result on the last step. So, I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, I get 29524, and then the 10th layer is 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after the innermost 10 layers, we have 88573, and then we multiply by 3. So, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I think I'm getting confused with the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(...)\", so let's count how many times this occurs.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" inside the outermost 3(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around with another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, I can see that after the first 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(...)\".\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3\" after the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+3\" is nested deeper. Let me count how many \"1+3\" expressions there are.\n\nStarting from the first one after the initial 3:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" after the initial 3. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, and then the outermost 3 multiplies the result.\n\nWait, so that means I should compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to 10 layers, which included the outermost 3. So, perhaps I need to correct that.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the 10th layer is 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573, and then the outermost 3 multiplies this result, so 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I thought there were 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(...)\".\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. Let's count how many times we have \"1+3(...)\".\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, excluding the initial 3, how many \"1+3(...)\" are there?\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have \"1+3(...)\", so:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers after the initial 3. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, each time adding another \"1+3(...)\".\n\nTherefore, we should compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 9 layers giving 29524, then the 10th layer being 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573, and then the outermost 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nBut if there are only 9 layers, then the 9th layer would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me recast this.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step, from 1 to 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, where did I go wrong before?\n\nI think I miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" after the initial 3. So, each layer corresponds to one step, and after 9 steps, we have 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nLet me confirm this by another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, so that's the final answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.\n\nLet me check for n=1: a_1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 =13\n\nFormula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=40\n\nFormula: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=121\n\nFormula: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was counting layers, I thought that the outermost layer would be the 10th step, but now I see that it's actually 9 layers, each corresponding to a step in the recurrence, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut let me just double-check by computing step by step without using the formula, to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by counting an extra layer, but now it's clear.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Substitute back into the next layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Continue substituting and computing each layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). Let me try to parse this from the inside out because that's usually how nested expressions work. \n\nStarting from the innermost part: \n\nThe innermost expression is 1+3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So, substituting the 4 we just got:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now that layer simplifies to 13. Let's move out another layer. The next expression is 1 + 3*(13). \n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo now, that layer simplifies to 40. Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40).\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThis is getting a bit bigger each time. Let me note down each step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8.

So, starting from the innermost, I've done nine steps, each time computing the innermost expression first and working my way out. \n\nSo, after the ninth step, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000.\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500.\n\nThen, 3*20 = 60.\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me verify:\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 is 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in breaking it down.\n\nWait, 29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so my initial breakdown was wrong because I think I added incorrectly. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Because 88572 seems quite a large number, and I want to ensure that each step was correct.\n\nSo, let's go through each layer again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, perhaps I can find a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost term is 4, which would be a_1, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the final result would be 3*a_9.\n\nBut let's see if this sequence follows a pattern. The recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3C - 3/2.\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: 11/6*3^n = (11*3^{n}) /6 = (11*3^{n-1}) /2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1}) /2 - 3/2.\n\nCombine terms: (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561: 10*6561=65610, plus 6561=72171.\n\nSo, a_9 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 29524 as the innermost term before multiplying by 3. Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the sequence. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the innermost term is 1+3=4, which I called a_1. Then, the next layer is 1+3*4=13, which would be a_2, and so on, up to a_9, which would be the term before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, according to the sequence, a_9 = 36084, and then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252. But that contradicts my earlier step-by-step computation which gave 88572.\n\nHmm, so there must be an error in either the step-by-step computation or in the recurrence relation.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step again:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n\n2. 1+3*4=13\n\n3. 1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\n10. 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, a_9=29524, which would be a_9=29524.\n\nBut according to the recurrence relation, a_9=36084.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that my recurrence relation approach might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the initial conditions. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the problem, the innermost term is 1+3=4, which I called a_1=4.\n\nThen, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1 + 3*4=13\n\na_3=1 + 3*13=40\n\na_4=1 + 3*40=121\n\na_5=1 + 3*121=364\n\na_6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nYes, so a_9=29524.\n\nBut according to my recurrence solution, a_n=(11*3^{n-1}-3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that would be (11*3^8 -3)/2 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = (72171 -3)/2=72168/2=36084.\n\nBut that's not matching a_9=29524.\n\nSo, clearly, my recurrence solution is incorrect. I must have made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence relation.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), right? So, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is correct: r=3, so C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution A.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: A = 3 + 3*A.\n\nSolving: A - 3A = 3 => -2A=3 => A= -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4=3C - 1.5.\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides: 5.5=3C => C=5.5/3=11/6.\n\nThus, a_n=(11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, but when n=1, a_1=(11*3^{0} -3)/2=(11 -3)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*3^{1}-3)/2=(33-3)/2=30/2=15. But according to our step-by-step, a_2=13. So, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, that's the problem. So, my recurrence solution gives a_2=15, but in reality, a_2=13.\n\nSo, my recurrence is incorrect. Therefore, my approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe expression is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we try a constant solution A.\n\nSo, A = 3 + 3*A => A -3A=3 => -2A=3 => A= -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying initial condition a_1=4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C=5.5 => C=5.5/3=11/6.\n\nThus, a_n=(11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut when n=2, a_2=(11/6)*9 - 3/2= (99/6) - (9/6)=90/6=15, which contradicts our step-by-step result of 13.\n\nSo, something is wrong here. Maybe the initial condition is not a_1=4, but a_0=4?\n\nWait, let's check.\n\nIn our step-by-step, a_1=4, a_2=13, etc.\n\nIf I set n=0: a_0=4.\n\nThen, for n>=1, a_n=3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThen, the recurrence would be a_n=3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSolving with a_0=4.\n\nThen, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nParticular solution: A=3 +3A => A=-3/2.\n\nThus, a_n=C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nApplying a_0=4: 4=C*1 - 3/2 => C=4 + 3/2=11/2.\n\nThus, a_n=(11/2)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, for n=1: a_1=(11/2)*3 - 3/2=(33/2 - 3/2)=30/2=15. But in our step-by-step, a_1=4. Wait, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misindexing the sequence.\n\nWait, in our problem, the innermost term is 1+3=4, which is the first term. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps a_1=4, a_2=13, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, if a_1=4, then a_n=(11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut when n=1, a_1=(11/6)*3 - 3/2= (33/6 - 9/6)=24/6=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11/6)*9 - 3/2= (99/6 - 9/6)=90/6=15. But according to our step-by-step, a_2=13.\n\nSo, discrepancy at n=2.\n\nWait, so perhaps the recurrence is not accurate because the step-by-step computation shows a different result.\n\nWait, maybe the recurrence is correct, but I'm misapplying the index. Let me try to compute a_2 using the recurrence.\n\nIf a_1=4, then a_2=3*(1 + a_1)=3*(1+4)=15, but according to step-by-step, a_2=13.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. Therefore, my step-by-step must be wrong.\n\nWait, no, in the step-by-step, the innermost is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, next layer is 1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nThen, next is 1 +3*(13)=40.\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence, a_2=15, but step-by-step gives a_2=13.\n\nSo, the discrepancy is because the recurrence is not correctly capturing the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer is 1+3*(previous).\n\nSo, the first layer is 1+3=4.\n\nSecond layer: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nThird layer:1 +3*13=40.\n\nFourth:1 +3*40=121.\n\nFifth:1 +3*121=364.\n\nSixth:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nSeventh:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nEighth:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNinth:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nTenth:3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the step-by-step is correct. Therefore, the recurrence must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, but in our case, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so perhaps the final result is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524.\n\nWait, but in the recurrence, I was solving for a_n=3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which would correspond to each layer being multiplied by 3.\n\nBut in the problem, the outermost 3 is only applied once at the end. So, perhaps the recurrence is slightly different.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me define b_n as the value after n layers, where each layer is 1 +3*b_{n-1}.\n\nSo, b_1=1+3=4.\n\nb_2=1+3*b_1=1+12=13.\n\nb_3=1+3*b_2=1+39=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to b_9=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*b_9=88572.\n\nSo, the recurrence is b_n=1 +3*b_{n-1}, with b_1=4.\n\nThus, the general solution for this recurrence would be different.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is b_n -3*b_{n-1}=0, which has solution C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can try a constant solution A.\n\nSo, A=1 +3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is b_n=C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition b_1=4.\n\nSo, 4=C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -0.5 => 3C=4.5 => C=1.5=3/2.\n\nThus, b_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nSimplify: (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute b_9.\n\nb_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^5=243, so 3^10=243^2=59049.\n\nThus, b_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYes, that matches our step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*b_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense now. The key was to correctly model the recurrence relation, ensuring that the initial condition and the particular solution were correctly applied. Initially, I misapplied the recurrence by considering the outermost multiplication as part of the recurrence, but in reality, the outermost 3 is only applied once at the very end. By correctly defining the recurrence for the inner layers and then multiplying by 3 at the end, everything aligns properly.\n\nTo recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n\n- Starting from the innermost, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\n- This forms a recurrence relation b_n = 1 + 3*b_{n-1}, with b_1=4.\n\n- Solving this recurrence gives b_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\n- For n=9, b_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\n- Finally, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost out, we find the value before the final multiplication by 3 to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to parse this expression.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the innermost part we just computed. So, it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Wait, actually, looking again, each step is 1 + 3 times the next inner expression. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly.\n\nLooking at the structure:\n\nIt's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))).\n\nSo each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(something)). So starting from the inside, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me start from Level 1 and go up to Level 9.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 39. So, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: Let's see, 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the Level 9 result. So, 3*(29524).\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify the multiplication step again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the previous steps because 88572 seems a bit large, but considering the number of layers, maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go back and verify each level step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280.

So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 *29524=88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the outermost 3(...), each inner part is another 3(...). So, let me count the number of times I see \"3(\".\n\nLooking at the LaTeX:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( adds a level. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 levels of 3(...). But when I was computing, I went up to Level 9, which would be the 9th 3(...). So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed, Level 1 was the innermost (1+3), and Level 9 was the outermost 3(...). So, perhaps I should have 9 layers, each with their own computation.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Level 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me try to compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)) at each level again, perhaps using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nHmm, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4, which is a positive integer, so maybe this approach is leading me astray.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144.\n\nDivide by 2:177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've verified each step, and the closed-form formula also gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, starting from the innermost part.\n\n1. **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each part is a similar structure: 3 times something in parentheses, and inside that something is another 1 plus 3 times another set of parentheses. So it's like a chain of these operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each time, the structure is 3 multiplied by (1 plus another expression). So, starting from the innermost one, which is 1 + 3, and then working my way out.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost one.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections. From the expression, I can see that after the first 3, there are nine \"1 + 3(...)\" terms. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is actually one more than the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, no, let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a closing one. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses: 1, then each 1+3 has an opening parenthesis, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time there's another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another ( inside: 1+3(...\n3. And so on, until the last one which is just 1+3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 1+3 terms. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Let me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nBut actually, the expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, and each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the innermost is 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of times 1+3 appears. From the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, I think there are 9 layers here, each time adding another 1+3 multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and moving outwards to the first layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, calculating each step.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost expression, and S9 is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen S2 = 1 + 3*S1\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2\n\nAnd so on, up to S9, and then the entire expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, no, looking at the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, the outermost is 3*S9, where S9 is 1 + 3*S8.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index them from the innermost as S1 to S9, with S1 = 1 + 3, S2 = 1 + 3*S1, etc., up to S9, and then the entire expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each step again carefully.\n\nStarting with S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step:\n\nS1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nS9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo 29524*3=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a pattern here that I can recognize? Because computing each step manually might be time-consuming, but maybe I can find a formula for S_n.\n\nLooking at the recursion: S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven S_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1:\n\nS_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe can also find the homogeneous solution and particular solution, but maybe it's easier to recognize the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the first few terms:\n\nS1 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a geometric progression with a multiplier of 3 each time, plus 1.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be written as S_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but S1=4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try to solve the recurrence properly.\n\nThe recurrence is S_n = 3*S_{n-1} + 1, with S1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is S_n = 3*S_{n-1}, whose solution is S_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form S_p = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is S_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition S1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nS1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: S2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: S3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: S4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nGiven that in our problem, we have S9, since we start from S1 as the innermost.\n\nSo S9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo S9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S9=3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I went through each step, checked the calculations, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves calculating a term of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By recognizing the pattern, we can use a formula to find the result more efficiently. The final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last one, right? Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the end, I see each \"1+3\" is inside another set of parentheses multiplied by 3. Let me write them out one by one to make it clearer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4.\n\n2. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So, 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). That would be 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 0*3 = 0, plus 2 is 2, write down 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nPutting it all together: 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the initial breakdown, I had 29524 * 3 as 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12, which adds up to 88572. So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step was:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems like a lot, but each step is manageable. Let me just verify each step again quickly to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks like all steps are correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I didn't skip any steps, and each calculation seems accurate. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, it's like a chain of operations where each step involves multiplying 3 by (1 plus the next step). \n\nI think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part is done. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me clarify.\n\nSo, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on ...))). So, each time, we have a 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). \n\nLet me try to define this recursively. Maybe if I let each layer be a function of the previous one, it'll be easier. Let's say that for each level n, the value is 3*(1 + value of level n-1). \n\nBut since this is a specific problem with a fixed number of layers, I can just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one.\n\nSo, let's count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: \n\nStarting from the left, the first part is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3*, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)). So, there are 9 layers in total. That means I need to compute from the innermost layer, which is the 9th, up to the first layer.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's the other way around. The innermost is the last one, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, let me list the layers from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since the number of layers is small (9 layers), computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nBut just for curiosity, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nEach layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9: L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut since I already computed each layer step by step and verified, I'm confident the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize that starting from the innermost layer is the way to go.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. After computing all layers up to the ninth, multiply the result by 3 as per the outermost operation.\n\n4. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations to compute the result more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nI think that's all. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires computing from the innermost parentheses outward. By evaluating each layer step by step, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this, we determine the value of the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 3 times (1 plus the next nested term). There are 9 layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. It seems like each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3( ... )\n3. 1+3( ... )\n...\nThere are nine layers in total because each \"1+3\" is wrapped in another set of parentheses multiplied by 3. So, I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1)\n\nSo, substituting Layer 1's result:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving outward, Layer 3 is:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2)\n\nWhich is:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, that's a jump. Let me double-check that calculation. 3*121 is indeed 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then add 1: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Add 1: 3280.\n\nWait, hold on, 3*1093. Let me compute that again to be sure. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 3279 +1 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then add 1: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then add 1: 29524.\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me check the calculation again. 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. That's correct.\n\nNow, finally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from Layer 9.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(result from Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just verify that once again to make sure I haven't made any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step isn't too bad. It might be a geometric series or something similar, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. It's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression.\n\nGiven:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 \\) is the innermost layer.

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is 1+3. So, let's start there.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost parentheses simplify to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(that result). So, substituting the 4 in, it becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, each time, I take the result from the innermost parentheses and plug it into the next layer. So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Then: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Then: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Then: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again. I think I might have missed a layer. Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, meaning there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, I think I have 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, so let me list them step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, so after computing all 9 layers, the innermost becomes 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, I think I missed that last step earlier.\n\nWait, no, let me see. The way the expression is structured is that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a new layer. So, after 9 layers, the innermost is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524). Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me list each step with the corresponding layer number:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost part becomes 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to just do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me think about the pattern here.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1) + a_0*(k^n). Wait, but in this case, a_1 = 1 + 3, so a_0 would be 1? Hmm, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating things. Since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\nWait, that might not be the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let's see:\n\nFrom the recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes, let me verify 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the result using a different method (the recurrence relation), I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next, leading to the final result after evaluating all layers.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Substitute 4 into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Substitute 13 into the next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Substitute 40 into the next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Substitute 121 into the next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Substitute 364 into the next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Substitute 1093 into the next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Substitute 3280 into the next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Substitute 9841 into the next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting confused.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). So, let's start there.\n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, actually, there are nine sets of parentheses, each with (1+3(...)). That means I need to compute each starting from the innermost one. Let me label them from the innermost as step 1 to the outermost as step 9.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3). That's 4.\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, when I replace the innermost (1+3) with 4, the next layer becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me correct that.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent each step more clearly. Let me write each step as a substitution.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is a sum of 1 and 3 times another expression. So, perhaps I should think of it as a recursive expression, where each level is 1 + 3*(next level). Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each level from the innermost as L1 to the outermost as L9.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). Hmm, but actually, the original expression is 3*(L9), but let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(L9). So, yes, the total expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is defined as above.\n\nWait, but in my initial thought, I thought L1 was the innermost, but perhaps I should index them differently. Let me make sure.\n\nActually, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). So, when I expand from the inside, I should compute that first, then work my way outwards. So, perhaps it's better to label them starting from the innermost as step 1, then step 2, etc., up to step 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let me try that.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(Step1)) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 2: 13\n\nStep 3: (1 + 3*(Step2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: (1 + 3*(Step3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*(Step4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: (1 + 3*(Step5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*(Step6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: (1 + 3*(Step7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*(Step8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Step9) = 3*29524\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost multiplication by 3 is after the last parentheses. So, if Step9 is the result of the innermost parentheses, then the next step is to compute 3*(Step9). Wait, no, actually, each step is the result of each level of parentheses, so the final result is 3*(Step9). Wait, no, because in my steps, each step is the result of each level of parentheses. So, the first step is the innermost, step1=4, then step2=13, step3=40, etc., up to step9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*step9, which would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(step9). So, yes, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems high.

Because when I computed step9, I got 29524, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nLet me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStep1: (1+3)=4\n\nStep2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nStep3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nStep4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nStep5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nStep6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nStep7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nStep8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nStep9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, when I computed up to step9=29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, so the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is right.\n\nLet's say I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*13)=3*(1 + 39)=3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*13)=3*(1 + 39)=3*40=120.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nCompute innermost:1+3=4\n\nNext:1 +3*4=13\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121\n\nOutermost:3*(1 +3*121)=3*(1 +363)=3*364=1092.\n\nWait, but if I compute the original expression with three layers:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match. Wait, no, I think I messed up the number of layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the small test, if I have three layers:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))\n\nCompute innermost:1+3=4\n\nNext:1 +3*4=13\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40\n\nOutermost:3*(1 +3*40)=3*(1 +120)=3*121=363.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) I thought it was 120, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, let me compute it step by step:\n\nCompute innermost:1+3=4\n\nNext:1 +3*4=13\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40\n\nOutermost:3*(1 +3*40)=3*(1 +120)=3*121=363.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, so in my initial small test, I had three layers, and the result was 363. So, my approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, with nine layers, I got step9=29524, so the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my step-by-step computations again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStep1:4\n\nStep2:1 +3*4=13\n\nStep3:1 +3*13=40\n\nStep4:1 +3*40=121\n\nStep5:1 +3*121=364\n\nStep6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nStep7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nStep8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nStep9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, each time, the expression is 1 +3*(next level). So, the first step is indeed the innermost (1+3)=4, then next is 1 +3*4=13, and so on up to step9=29524, then multiply by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each step manually. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each level is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\nWait, but actually, L_1 is (1+3)=4, then L_2=1 +3*L1=13, L3=1 +3*L2=40, etc.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level of the expression follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next level)}\\). By iteratively computing each level and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I remember that when dealing with parentheses, I should start from the innermost one and work my way outwards. So, I'll start by identifying the innermost expression and compute that first.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is \"1 + 3\". That seems straightforward. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is \"1 + 3( something )\". Since I just simplified the innermost part, let me substitute that 4 back into the expression.\n\nSo, the next level out is: 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute the multiplication: 3 * 4 = 12\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so now that part simplifies to 13. Let me move one level out again. The next expression is another \"1 + 3( something )\", where \"something\" is now 13. So substituting that in:\n\n1 + 3(13)\n\nCompute the multiplication first: 3 * 13 = 39\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, that simplifies to 40. I think I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, actually, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each level, I'm substituting the previous result into the next expression. Let me count the number of levels to ensure I don't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\n10. Finally, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a level, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of nested \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach time, it's one more level. So, how many times does \"1 + 3(...)\" occur?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is one level, and each time, it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count the number of these.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\n10. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, so that's 9 levels of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions, right? Because each time, it's another set of parentheses. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nUp to the 9th level, and then the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, that's 9 levels, each time computing \"1 + 3*(previous result)\".\n\nSo, let me compute each level step by step:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so after 9 levels, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result.\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3*(29524). Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nHmm, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, that's breaking down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nBut actually, 29524 is 29000 + 524.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 directly.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n= ?\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount the levels:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nEach step, we have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is given by:\n\na_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - k)) * k^n + c/(1 - k)\n\nIn this case, k = 3, c = 1.\n\nSo, the solution would be:\n\na_n = (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 1/(1 - 3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (a_0 + 1/2) * 3^n - 1/2\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is the first term after the innermost. So, maybe n starts at 1.\n\nWait, let me think. The innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\na_n = (a_0 + 1/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nBut here, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me plug in n=1:\n\n4 = (a_0 + 1/2)*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = (a_0 + 1/2)*3 - 1/2\n\nLet me solve for a_0:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*(a_0 + 1/2)\n\n4.5 = 3*a_0 + 1.5\n\nSubtract 1.5 from both sides:\n\n3 = 3*a_0\n\nSo, a_0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (1 + 1/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\n1. Start from the innermost: 1+3=4\n\n2. Then, 1+3*4=13\n\n3. 1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the recurrence relation, we found that a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing \"1 + 3*(previous result)\", starting from the innermost \"1 + 3 = 4\" and proceeding through nine levels. After reaching the ninth level, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a recurrence relation formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

It seems like a nested expression where each layer is similar but has one more set of parentheses. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part is done. Now, moving one layer out, I have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me write it down step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4). \n\nWait, is it 3*(4) or 3*(something else)? Let me make sure. The expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, yes, after the first step, it's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nSo, step 2 gives me 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13).\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nSo, step 3 gives me 40.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me check if this pattern continues.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40).\n\nCalculating: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nSo, step 4 gives me 121.\n\nWait, 121? That's a nice number, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3*40 is indeed 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, moving on.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121).\n\nCalculating: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nSo, step 5 gives me 364.\n\nHmm, 364. Let me just verify that multiplication. 121 times 3 is 363, yes, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364).\n\nCalculating: 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1, so 1093.\n\nSo, step 6 gives me 1093.\n\nWait, 1093? That seems a bit large, but let's check the multiplication again. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Yes, correct. Then plus 1 is 1093. Okay, moving on.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093).\n\nCalculating: 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1, so 3280.\n\nSo, step 7 gives me 3280.\n\nWait, 3280? Hmm, that's a big number, but let's verify. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, plus 1 is 3280. Okay, moving on.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280).\n\nCalculating: 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1, so 9841.\n\nSo, step 8 gives me 9841.\n\nWait a second, 9841? That number seems familiar. Isn't that a square number? Let me check: 99^2 is 9801, 100^2 is 10000, so 9841 is between them. Maybe it's 99.2 or something, but not a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Yes, that's correct. Plus 1 is 9841. Okay, no mistake there.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841).\n\nCalculating: 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1, so 29524.\n\nSo, step 9 gives me 29524.\n\nWait, 29524? That seems like a large number, but let me check the multiplication. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Yes, plus 1 is 29524. Okay, moving on.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524).\n\nCalculating: 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572.\n\nSo, step 10 gives me 88572.\n\nWait, so the final result is 88572? Let me just go through all the steps again quickly to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Each step follows logically, and the calculations check out. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my steps. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each step manually.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the problem, it's a series of nested expressions each of the form 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote each step as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, since there are 9 layers of nesting.\n\nSo, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check: n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 would be the next layer, etc., up to a_9 being the result before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have 3*(a_9). So, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result.\n\nWow, that's a neat formula. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used the closed-form expression to find a_9 and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. That would have saved a lot of time, especially if the expression had more layers.\n\nBut since I was doing it manually, step by step, it worked out, and I arrived at the same answer. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). By either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, I arrived at the final result of 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous result})\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using a recurrence relation, the closed-form solution for the nth layer is found to be \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to see the structure better. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Then that result is multiplied by 3, and added 1, and so on. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we go out to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), so let's count:\n\n1. The first (1 + 3(...\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and this continues until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3( parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n10. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers? Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the first 3(, there's a 1+3( and so on. Let's count the number of 1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another 1+3(...\n3. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1+3 has a closing parenthesis. Let's count the number of closing ) in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after 1+3, there's a ), and that repeats. Let me count the number of )s:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n1. )\n2. )\n3. )\n4. )\n5. )\n6. )\n7. )\n8. )\n9. )\n10. )\n\nWait, that's 10 closing parentheses, but the innermost is 1+3, so perhaps 9 layers? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach it step by step, computing each layer from the inside out.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start from the innermost expression and work my way out. Let's denote each layer as E1, E2, ..., E9, where E1 is the innermost.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*(E1)\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*(E2)\n\nAnd so on, until E9, and then the outermost expression is 3*(E9).\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer is 1+3*(previous layer).

So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3(, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nEach layer is 1+3(...). So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\nAfter 3(, there's 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each time you have a 1+3(, so starting from the first 3(, then 9 more layers, making it 10 layers in total. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to E9, which would be 9 layers. So perhaps I missed one layer.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3( sequences:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another 1+3(\n3. Another 1+3(\n4. Another 1+3(\n5. Another 1+3(\n6. Another 1+3(\n7. Another 1+3(\n8. Another 1+3(\n9. Another 1+3(\n10. Then the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(, starting from the first one after the initial 3(, making it 9 layers. So, in my calculation, E1 to E9 correspond to these 9 layers, and then the outermost 3*(E9) gives the final result.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of closing parentheses, I see 9 closing ) after the innermost 1+3, which would correspond to 9 layers. So, perhaps my initial calculation is correct, with 9 layers, leading to E9 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me check each step again.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, looking at each step, each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, E1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for E9, which is the 9th layer, n=9:\n\nE9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this structure.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, I see a 1+3. Let me write that down:\n\nFirst innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, I see another 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Wait, actually, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, each level seems to be 1 + 3*(something). So, maybe I should compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me try to write down each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so maybe I should number each layer from the inside out. Let's count how many layers there are. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think there are 8 layers of 1+3(...) inside. Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which I think is 9 times, but let me count.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression as a series of nested expressions.\n\nLet me define each layer as E1, E2, E3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous expression), and this repeats 8 times before the outermost 3*(...). So perhaps there are 8 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), so the number of such expressions is 9, perhaps? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...), so how many times does 1+3 appear inside? Let me count the opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). So, let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each time, I see a 1+3, so:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me define each level:\n\nLet me denote E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times? Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...).

(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, so that's 8 layers. So, E1 to E8, and then the entire expression is 3*E8.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my earlier counting. So, let's see:\n\nIf I have E1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E8.\n\nSo, that's 8 layers inside, each time 1 + 3*(previous expression), and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nOkay, so I'll compute each E step by step.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841\n\nLet me compute that: 3*9841\n\nWell, 9841 * 3:\n\nCompute 9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nSo, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 9841 * 3:\n\nCompute 9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nNow, 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29, carryover 2\n\nBut wait, that's 9841, so:\n\nWait, 9841 is 9 (thousands place), 8 (hundreds), 4 (tens), 1 (units).\n\nSo, 1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carryover 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 becomes 2000, so total is 29523.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the E1 to E8 calculations.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 29523.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps using a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nSo,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen,\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nE1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus,\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nE_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nAlternatively, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nE4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nE5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nE6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nE7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nE8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, E8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29523, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^9 - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29523.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute E8 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nE8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\n3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with both iterative calculation and a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

It seems like it's a series of multiplications and additions, so maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, let's write this out step by step. I think the best way is to start from the innermost part and compute each layer one by one. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3. Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the inner parentheses. Hmm, maybe I need to be more precise.\n\nWait, let's parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3 times a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, perhaps it's a recursive structure where each level is 1 + 3 times the next level.\n\nLet me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2.

So, after computing L9, we have to multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, the total would be 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because when I did it the first way, adding up each part, I got 88572, but let me confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 * 9 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, indeed, 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed L9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if I correctly computed each L1 to L9.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer. Let's count how many:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. ... up to nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a new layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, it's nine layers. So, L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, yes, after computing L9, we have 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in each step. Let me recompute each Li:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps seem correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo,\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

There are nine sets of parentheses here, so it's like a chain of these expressions. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write this out step by step. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me write that down:\n\nFirst layer (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is:\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(result from first layer) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the second layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let's do that:\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*(result from second layer) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, the third layer is 40. Let me continue this process step by step.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*(result from third layer) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(result from fourth layer) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*(result from fifth layer) = 1 + 3*364\n\nLet me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(result from sixth layer) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093. Well, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(result from seventh layer) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nLet me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(result from eighth layer) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check that calculation because I might have made a mistake.\n\nSo, 3*9841: Let me break it down differently. 9841 * 3. Let's compute 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, and 1*3 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, yes, that's correct. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, which is the original expression: 3 times the result from the ninth layer. So, the final computation is:\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(result from ninth layer) = 3*29524\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. \n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems really large. Let me confirm the multiplication another way to be sure. Maybe using another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n\nAnd that's it. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 2, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I think I might have misaligned the digits. Let me try writing it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the units digit, we have 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers, let me go through the layers again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way or see if there's a pattern.\n\nWait a minute, this expression looks like it's forming a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we also arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nLooking back at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(something). If I expand this expression, it's a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by 1, but I need to see exactly how it's structured.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, when we expand this, each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but with a twist because each layer adds a 1.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nSo, each layer is indeed building up the expression as a sum of powers of 3, but each time adding 1 before multiplying by 3. So, it's like a repeated process where each step is 1 + 3*(previous total). \n\nBut perhaps another way to see this is to note that each layer is effectively a term in a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. This is similar to the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but with an additional constant term at each step.\n\nWait, actually, the formula we derived earlier for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBut that's quite a mouthful. So, breaking it down step by step is the most straightforward way.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. The key was to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and then building up the result. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I could derive a closed-form formula to compute the ninth layer directly, which corroborated the step-by-step result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by simplifying the innermost expression and work our way outwards:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to parse this. It seems like each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then doing that again with the result. \n\nLet me see if I can write this out layer by layer. Maybe I'll start from the inside and work my way out. Let's count the number of layers. I think there are nine layers of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(previous result). \n\nLet me try to write each step down:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this result A1.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(A1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, A2 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(A2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, A3 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(A3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. A4 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(A4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. A5 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(A5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. A6 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(A6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. A7 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(A7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. A8 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(A8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. A9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original problem is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses. So, after computing A9, which is the result inside the outermost parentheses, we need to multiply that by 3. \n\nSo, the final step is: 3 * A9 = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. A1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. A2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. A3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. A4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. A5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. A6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. A7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. A8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. A9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me verify the multiplication at the end again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each A_n as the result after n layers, then A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, with A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Specifically, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for A_n.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nA_n = 3*A_{n-1} + 1, with A_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: A_n - 3*A_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution A_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is A_n = A_n^h + A_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, A_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nA_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nA_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, A_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's check: The innermost is A1, then A2, up to A9, so n=9.\n\nSo, A9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, A9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since A_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*A9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nSo, 3*A9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, we get the same answer.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by recognizing that each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous result})\\). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost part outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nWe can also verify this using a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation. The general solution for \\(A_n\\) is:\n\n\\[ A_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\):\n\n\\[ A_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nThen, multiplying by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me write it down and see.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1+3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading it correctly. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each level is 1 + 3 times the next inner expression.\n\nLet me try to visualize this structure. It's like each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd this goes on until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers.

Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the problem has nine sets of parentheses.\n\nSo, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outwards.\n\nLet me create a list or something to keep track of each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 times the outermost expression, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in one of the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nEach time we go out, we add another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, actually, each time we have a new (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears as a separate expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer, because there are nine sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, the first (1+3) is the innermost, so that's Layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3*(...). So, Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final 3 multiplier.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time adding another \"1+3(\".\n\nTherefore, Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), and Layer 9 is the outermost expression before the final 3 multiplier.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute it without calculating each layer step by step, but since it's only 9 layers, it's manageable manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, I can compute 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nThat's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, that's consistent as well.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the innermost expression and work our way outwards.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the very last part: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, it's 3 times 4. Let me write that down.\n\n3 * 4 = 12. So, that part simplifies to 12. Now, the next layer out is another (1 + ...), where the ... is the 12 we just got. So, let's compute that.\n\n1 + 12 equals 13. Got it. Now, moving out another layer, we have 3 times this new result. So, 3 * 13. Let me calculate that.\n\n3 * 13 is 39. Hmm, okay, so that simplifies to 39. Next layer out is another (1 + ...). So, 1 + 39.\n\n1 + 39 is 40. Then, moving out another layer, it's 3 times 40. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 40 is 120. Alright, so that's 120. Next layer out is 1 + 120.\n\n1 + 120 is 121. Then, moving out another layer, it's 3 times 121. Hmm, 3 * 120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 3 * 121 is 363. That's a bit bigger, but okay.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 363. That's 364. Then, moving out, it's 3 times 364. Let me compute that. 3 * 300 is 900, 3 * 60 is 180, and 3 * 4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3 * 364 is 1092.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 1092. That's 1093. Then, moving out, it's 3 times 1093. Let me compute that. 3 * 1000 is 3000, 3 * 90 is 270, and 3 * 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3 * 1093 is 3279.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3279. That's 3280. Then, moving out, it's 3 times 3280. Let me calculate that. 3 * 3000 is 9000, 3 * 200 is 600, and 3 * 80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3 * 3280 is 9840.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 9840. That's 9841. Then, moving out, it's 3 times 9841. Hmm, let me break that down. 3 * 9000 is 27000, 3 * 800 is 2400, 3 * 40 is 120, and 3 * 1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3 * 9841 is 29523.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 29523. That's 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 20000 is 60000, 3 * 9000 is 27000, 3 * 500 is 1500, 3 * 20 is 60, and 3 * 4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3 * 4 = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3 * 13 = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n6. 3 * 40 = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n8. 3 * 121 = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n10. 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. 3 * 9841 = 29523\n17. (1 + 29523) = 29524\n18. 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems like each step adds up correctly. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's right, but let me verify one more time, maybe by computing it in a different way or looking for a pattern.\n\nWait a second, this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually. Maybe that would be faster and less error-prone.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 3*(1 + ...). Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, if I denote each step as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, as we computed earlier. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then 3*4=12, then 1 + 12=13, then 3*13=39, etc. So, it's like a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 3*a_1 + 3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, each step is of the form 3*(1 + previous term). So, if I let a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120, and so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 12.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 3.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 3 => -2*a_p = 3 => a_p = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=12.\n\nSo, 12 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 12 = 3C - 1.5.\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides: 13.5 = 3C => C = 4.5.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = 4.5*3^n - 1.5.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (9*3^n - 3)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, because 9 is 3^2, so 9*3^n = 3^{n+2}. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nNow, let's check if this formula works with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{3} - 3)/2 = (27 - 3)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^4 - 3)/2 = (81 - 3)/2 = 78/2 = 39. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^5 - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3(...): there are 9 instances. Wait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, starting with (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + ...), and so on, 9 times. Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of terms in the sequence a_n is 9, right?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) \u2192 4 \u2192 a_1 = 3*4 =12\n\nNext: 3*(1 +12)=39 \u2192 a_2=39\n\nNext: 3*(1 +39)=120 \u2192 a_3=120\n\nNext: 3*(1 +120)=363 \u2192 a_4=363\n\nNext: 3*(1 +363)=1092 \u2192 a_5=1092\n\nNext: 3*(1 +1092)=3279 \u2192 a_6=3279\n\nNext: 3*(1 +3279)=9840 \u2192 a_7=9840\n\nNext: 3*(1 +9840)=29523 \u2192 a_8=29523\n\nNext: 3*(1 +29523)=88572 \u2192 a_9=88572\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers, meaning n=9 in our sequence.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{9+2} - 3)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.\n\nYup, that matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me try computing a couple more terms using the formula to see if they match my earlier results.\n\nFor example, a_4 should be 363.\n\nUsing the formula: a_4 = (3^{6} - 3)/2 = (729 - 3)/2 = 726/2 = 363. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_5: (3^7 - 3)/2 = (2187 - 3)/2 = 2184/2 = 1092. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works, and using it, I can confirm that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the innermost expression, then substituting back into the next layer, and repeating this process until the entire expression is simplified. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows the use of a formula to find the result more efficiently. Both methods lead to the same final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Innermost Expression:**\n   - Start with the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Work Outwards Layer by Layer:**\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 12 = 13\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 13 = 39\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 39 = 40\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 40 = 120\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 120 = 121\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 121 = 363\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 363 = 364\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 364 = 1092\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 1093 = 3279\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 3280 = 9840\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\).\n   - Next layer: \\(1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n   - Finally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n3. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   - Recognize the expression follows a recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1})\\).\n   - Solve the recurrence to find a closed-form formula: \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+2} - 3}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), compute \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2} = \\frac{177147 - 3}{2} = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

It seems like a nested expression where each part is 1 plus 3 times something. There are multiple layers of these parentheses, so I think I need to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That makes sense because in math problems with nested parentheses, you always solve the innermost ones first.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside, each time I see a \"1+3(...)\" and then multiplied by 3. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1+3, right? So that's the first layer.\n2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from the first layer).\n3. Then, that result is multiplied by 3, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, let me parse this correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, there are nine layers in total, right? Because each time we have another set of parentheses. Let me confirm that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses, I see that each time it's 1 + 3*(...), and each time it's nested. Let me count the number of \"1+\" sections. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that's nine layers of 1+3(...). So, each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. So, I think I need to compute this starting from the innermost part and work my way out, layer by layer. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nested part. So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because sometimes when you break down numbers, you might make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that's 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9.

Then, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 3*(L9), where L9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing each layer as I go.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at layer n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can plug in the initial conditions to find A and B.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nNow, let's find another condition. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nSo, for n=2:\n\na_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9/6 = 3/2\n\nThen, plugging A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to write the entire expression in terms of the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. By breaking it down step by step, each layer is computed, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total, each multiplied by 3 at the outermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9):**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see... It seems like there are multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times something, and each time it's wrapped in another set of parentheses multiplied by 3. So, maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier.\n\nLet me try to write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and move outward, calculating each part as I go.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: \n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nSo, the next layer out is: 1 + 3*(result from the first layer). Since the first layer was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that's the second layer: 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(result from the second layer). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, third layer: 40.\n\nMoving outward, the next layer is: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Fourth layer: 121.\n\nNext, fifth layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Fifth layer result: 364.\n\nContinuing outward, sixth layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is... let me see, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Sixth layer: 1093.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Seventh layer: 3280.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. Well, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Eighth layer: 9841.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Hmm, 3*9841. Let me break it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Ninth layer: 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, looking back at the problem, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many parentheses there are. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), and each layer adds another 3(...) around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: after the initial 3(, there are nine more layers. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around. So, actually, I might have gone one layer too deep. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has nine layers of 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then, each time you go out, you add another layer. So, let me try again, carefully.\n\nLet me list each layer from innermost to outermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after Layer9, we're still inside the outermost 3(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that would be 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 29524*3 should be 88572. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to miscalculate with so many layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the final step is multiplying that by 3.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Maybe recognizing a pattern could help, but since it's only nine layers, computing step by step seems manageable.\n\nWait, let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can express this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, and f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nSo, f(1)=4\n\nf(2)=1 + 3*4=13\n\nf(3)=1 + 3*13=40\n\nf(4)=1 + 3*40=121\n\nf(5)=1 + 3*121=364\n\nf(6)=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nf(7)=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nf(8)=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nf(9)=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I can be more confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a closed-form formula for f(n). The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nFrom the recurrence: f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, 0 = 2B + 1 => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nwe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4.

Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, it's like a chain of these 3 times (1 + ...) expressions. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one.\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outwards, it's Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on up to Layer 9.

So, the inner expression is the Layer 9 result, which is 29524, and then we multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of parentheses to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)).\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) - Layer 1\n\n2. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 2\n\n3. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 3\n\n4. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 4\n\n5. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 5\n\n6. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 6\n\n7. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 7\n\n8. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 8\n\n9. (1 + 3(...) - Layer 9\n\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted earlier. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer 1, up to Layer 9 being the outermost (1 + 3(...)).\n\nBut in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my initial calculation was correct, where Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, which is the result inside the parentheses, and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I stopped at Layer 9, which was 29524, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to multiply 29524 by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nLet me recount the layers.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote L_n as the result of the nth layer, then:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\nL_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), leading to a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence provides a formula for the nth layer, which can then be used to compute the final result efficiently. The final computation yields the result 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like it's a series of multiplications and additions, with each layer having 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that next.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nSo, substituting the previous result, which was 4, we get:\n\n1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nSo, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(this new result). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 121. That's a nice number, seems familiar, like 11 squared. Not sure if that's relevant, but just noting.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that.\n\n3*121 is... 363, right? Because 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364.\n\nSo, 364 is the result of that layer.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's see.\n\n3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nSo, that layer simplifies to 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check: 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that.\n\n3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me compute 3*9841 step by step:\n\nFirst, 9841 * 3:\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n- 800 * 3 = 2400\n\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7\n\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute that.\n\n3*88573: Hmm, let's compute 88573 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n80000 *3=240000\n\n8000*3=24000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n70*3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding those together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573=265719\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way. Maybe using another method.\n\nAlternatively, 88573 * 3:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2\n\nBut wait, 88573 is a 5-digit number: 8,8,5,7,3.\n\nWait, actually, 88573 is:\n\n- 80,000\n\n- 8,000\n\n- 500\n\n- 70\n\n- 3\n\nSo, 80,000*3=240,000\n\n8,000*3=24,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n70*3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*88573=265,719\n\nAdding 1 gives 265,720.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*265720. Let's compute that.\n\n3*265720: Let's compute that.\n\n265,720 *3:\n\n200,000*3=600,000\n\n60,000*3=180,000\n\n5,000*3=15,000\n\n700*3=2,100\n\n20*3=60\n\n0*3=0\n\nAdding them up:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160\n\nSo, 3*265,720 = 797,160\n\nAdding 1 gives 797,161.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n265,720 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3=0\n\n2*3=6\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, writing it out: 797,160. Then adding 1 gives 797,161.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*797,161. Let's compute that.\n\n3*797,161: Let's compute.\n\n700,000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000\n\n100*3=300\n\n60*3=180\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161 = 2,391,483\n\nAdding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n797,161 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carryover 1\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carryover 2\n\nBut wait, 797,161 is a 6-digit number: 7,9,7,1,6,1.\n\nWait, let me correct that.

Then, adding 1 gives 193,710,244.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the very outer layer is 3 multiplied by this final result. Let me write that down.\n\n3*193,710,244.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result we just computed, which is 193,710,244.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I started from the innermost and worked outwards, and each step was multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the very outermost expression is 3*(result of the innermost expression). But in the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(something). So, in my last step, I computed 1 + 3*(64,570,081) = 193,710,244. So, that is the \"something\" that is being multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this is done 9 times, I think.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3(1+...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(previous)\n\nSo, each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nI think there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then 1 + 3*(layer1) is layer2, and so on up to layer9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went from the innermost (layer1) up to layer9, which gave me 193,710,244. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(layer9). So, I need to compute 3*193,710,244.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, is the outermost operation 3*(...), or is it 3*(1 + 3*(...))? So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, when I started, I thought the innermost was 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the very first operation is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after 9 layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, and the outermost is 3*(layer9). Wait, but in my computation, I computed layer1 to layer9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous). So, layer1: 4, layer2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524, but wait, no, wait, in my earlier steps, I went up to 193,710,244, which would be layer9, but let me recount.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer9)\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went beyond that, up to 193 million. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me look at the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 which is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but in the problem, it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(inner layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 193 million, which would be if I continued beyond Layer9. So, perhaps the problem has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n\n2. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n3. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n4. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n5. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n6. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n7. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n8. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n9. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n\n10. Inside that: 1+3\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 3(1+3(...)) starting from the first 3, and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, total layers would be 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost operation is 3*(result of 9 layers). So, in that case, the total computation would be:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 193 million, which would be if I continued beyond Layer9. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, that's the innermost, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 1 + 3( occurs after the initial 3.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nAlright, let me see. It's a bunch of nested expressions with a lot of 3s and 1s. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the expression to make it a bit clearer, maybe numbering each layer to keep track. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Let's compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, that part is done. Now, moving one layer out, we have another expression that uses this result. Let's look at the next layer:\n\n1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. Okay, so the next layer gives us 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another similar structure: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13. First, 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so now we're at 40. I think I'm seeing a pattern here, but let me continue to make sure.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*40. So, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Interesting, 121. Wait, that's 11 squared, but maybe that's just a coincidence.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that. 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 is 364. Okay, so 364 is the next result.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*364. Let's do the math. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, 1093. Not sure if that's a prime or anything, but maybe not relevant here.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. So, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, 3280 is the result here.\n\nAnother layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Hmm, 9841. I wonder if that's a square number. Let me check: 99 squared is 9801, 100 squared is 10000, so 9841 is between them. Maybe 99.2 squared? Not sure, but maybe not important right now.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841 first. 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding these up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let's calculate 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*797161. Let's compute 3*797161. Hmm, 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 is 2391484.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many times I've done this. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, up to nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I did the innermost as (1+3)=4, then each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer. So, I think I went through nine layers. Let me recount to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each next layer adds another (1 + 3*(result)). Let me list each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, I think I messed up earlier by going beyond Layer 9. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's 88572. Hmm, but let me check that multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond Layer 9, which was a mistake. So, the correct final result should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought I had 2391484, which was wrong because I continued beyond Layer 9. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each time we add another layer.\n\nWait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nYes, so 9 layers in total. So, Layer9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I first started computing, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing beyond Layer9, I ended up with 2391484, which was wrong because I had an extra layer. So, I need to make sure I only compute up to Layer9.\n\nSo, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm each layer once again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a recursive formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the sequence would be:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the ninth term is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n, but since n is only 9, it's probably faster to compute each step as I did.\n\nWait, but just for my own understanding, let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\na9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a general formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 3s and 1s. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing a recurrence relation allows us to find a general formula, confirming the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous result})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Outermost Expression:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That usually seems to work with these kinds of expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last one: 1+3. That's straightforward. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, the next step is:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now I have 13. Moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me check: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is indeed 40. Okay, moving on.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Got it.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364: let me compute that again. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Okay.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093: let me calculate that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let me compute 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and there are nine such layers inside the first 3.\n\nWait, but when I worked through the layers, I only did 9 steps. So, the first step was the innermost 1+3, then each step outwards, and the last result was 29524, which is the result of the innermost 1 + 3*(...). Then, the next layer is 3*(29524), right?\n\nWait, no, let me make sure. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and this happens 8 times, and then the outermost is 3*(result). Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(...). How many such layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count:\n\nAfter the innermost, there are 8 more layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each time wrapping around. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each step out adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\", so that's 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, starting from the innermost.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n---------\n\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again step by step, because when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in the calculations.\n\nWait, in the earlier steps, when I computed each layer, I went up to 29524, which is the result of the innermost 1 + 3*(...). Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524), which is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me consider that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*prev.\n\nWait, but in this case, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each step is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, let me model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would be helpful, but since this is a problem with only 9 layers, maybe it's faster to compute each step manually as I did.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nThat's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, and there are 9 such layers before the innermost \"1 + 3\". So, the number of layers is 9, leading to a_9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLet me list each step with the value:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Outermost: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nEach step seems correct, so I think the answer is 88,572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

It looks like a repeating pattern. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Since the innermost was 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving another level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). The previous result was 13, so this becomes (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, that level simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next expression is (1 + 3*40). Let me calculate that.\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, that becomes 121.\n\nNext level: (1 + 3*121). Let me compute 3*121 first.\n\n3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, that's 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: (1 + 3*364). Let's compute 3*364.\n\n3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093.\n\n3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nAnother layer out: (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841.\n\nWell, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nMoving out another level: (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3*20000 = 60000, 3*9524 = let's see, 3*9000=27000, 3*524=1572. So, 27000 + 1572 = 28572. Then, 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me check that calculation again because 3*29524 seems a bit high. Let me compute it more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that's correct. So, that layer is 88573.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3*88573.\n\nLet's break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9.\n\nWait, actually, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3.\n\nSo, 80000*3 = 240000\n\n8000*3 = 24000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n70*3 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nThen, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nSo, the outermost expression simplifies to 265720.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because the initial problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of layers. Each time, it's a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many times the expression repeats. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), and each time we go out one layer, we add another 3*(...).\n\nSo, let me count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) + 1 = 13\n3. 3*(13) + 1 = 40\n4. 3*(40) + 1 = 121\n5. 3*(121) + 1 = 364\n6. 3*(364) + 1 = 1093\n7. 3*(1093) + 1 = 3280\n8. 3*(3280) + 1 = 9841\n9. 3*(9841) + 1 = 29524\n10. 3*(29524) + 1 = 88573\n11. 3*(88573) + 1 = 265720\n\nWait, so that's 11 layers? Wait, but let me check again because I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, the initial problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so how many times does that happen?\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*(88573) = 265720\n\nWait, so that's 11 layers? But when I look at the original problem, how many times does (1+3(...) occur? Let me check:\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...).\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let me count how many times (1+3(...)) appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then, moving out, each time it's (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), and then each layer adds another (1+3(...)) up to 9 times. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...)) with the innermost\n3. (1+3(...)) with the previous result\n...\nSo, how many times does (1+3(...)) occur?\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 times. Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with 9 closing parentheses: ))))))))).\n\nWait, no, let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is wrapped in another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, no, because each (1+3(...)) is a separate layer. Let me try to count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each time we have a (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, leading to 9 computations of (1 + 3*...).\n\nWait, but when I started computing earlier, I ended up with 265720, but perhaps I overcounted the layers. Let me try again.\n\nLet me list each step clearly:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nWait, so that's 11 layers, but according to the problem, the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times (1+3) is present.\n\nEach (1+3) is at the end, so starting from the innermost, how many layers?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a (1+3(...)), and each layer adds another multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, leading to 9 computations of (1 + 3*...), so let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result is 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Then, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression, which after 9 layers is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 11 layers, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each time it's wrapped in another (1+3(...)), and there are 9 such layers, ending with 9 closing parentheses.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of layers is 9, leading to the innermost being 4, and after 9 layers, the inner expression is 29524. Then, the outermost 3*(29524) is 88572.\n\nWait, but then where did I get 265720 earlier? That must be a mistake. Let me recount properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I was counting the layers beyond the 9, which isn't correct.\n\nLet me try again, this time carefully counting each layer.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 11 layers, but that must be incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial counting.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), and the number of such layers is 9, because after the innermost, there are 8 more layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, which would mean that the innermost is 4, and after 9 layers, we get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to 265720, which must be wrong. Let me try to compute step by step again, carefully.\n\n1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, so the final result is 88572. But earlier, I thought I had 265720, which must be incorrect because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can verify this with a different approach. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 11 layers, but that was a mistake. The problem only has 9 layers, so the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), and the number of such layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis after the first 3(...) adds a new layer.\n\nSo, with 9 layers, the result is 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought I had 265720, but that must have been a miscalculation due to miscounting the layers. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem has more layers than I thought. Let me count the number of times (1+3) appears at the end.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), and the number of times (1+3) is present is 9 times, because each time we have an additional (1+3) inside another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, which would mean that after 9 layers, the inner expression is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is correctly parenthesized. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me count the number of opening and closing parentheses.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3(...) adds one opening parenthesis and one closing parenthesis. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), and the total number of closing parentheses at the end is 9.\n\nWait, so the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1 + 3*(...)) adds a new layer, and there are 9 such layers after the initial 3*(...). So, that would mean 9 layers, leading to the innermost being (1+3) and after 9 layers, we get 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed earlier, I had 11 layers, but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me try to compute again, carefully counting the layers.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265720, which must have been a mistake. I think the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Let me consider that each layer is a term in a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265720, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct number of layers is 9, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the innermost expression and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nAfter 9 layers, the result is 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAlright, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 1 and then multiplied by 3. So, it's like a chain of expressions where each one is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to count them to make sure I don't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, right? So that's the first one.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. And this pattern continues until the outermost parentheses.\n\nWait, maybe I should label each layer to keep track. Let me assign each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nHmm, that seems systematic. So, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start with Layer 1.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple. Now, moving to Layer 2.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nHmm, 3*364. Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180+12=1092.\n\nSo, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nNow, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then +123 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure. Maybe I should do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, reading from top: 7, 7, 7, 5, 2, 1.\n\nWait, that gives 88572. Hmm, maybe I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait a second, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I did that right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nLet me denote L(n) as the value of layer n. Then,\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p is a constant, so L_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSubtract 3*L_p from both sides:\n\n-2*L_p = 1\n\nSo, L_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, layer n=9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 manually again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSame result. So, I'm confident that 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's see. This is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3(something). Since it's nested so many times, I think the best way to tackle this is by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I see a 1+3(...). Let me count: \n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Continuing this way, it seems there are 9 layers in total because each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and I can see 9 sets of parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, it's written as 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So the number of layers is actually 9, starting from the innermost 1+3 and going out. Let me confirm by writing them out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)) and there are 9 sets of 1 + 3(...) inside each other, each multiplied by 3. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...) multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, let me approach this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. I'll compute each layer one by one and keep track of the results.\n\nLet's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nProceeding to L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext, L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen, L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nMoving on to L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nFinally, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, we need to multiply this by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, final result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 29524 * 3: Let me do it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down, I thought 29524*3 is 88572, which matches.\n\nBut let me check if my layers were correctly computed.\n\nWait, let's go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I saw the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each step, we compute the innermost first, then build up each layer.\n\nSo, to make it clear, let's list each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I have 9 layers correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, each next layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the first 3, we have 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...) inside each other.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, my earlier computation seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at each layer:\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which is much faster, especially for a large number of layers.\n\nBut since I had to compute each layer manually before recognizing the pattern, it's a good exercise to ensure accuracy.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Starting from the innermost part, which is just 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3 multiplied by 3. It seems like there are nine layers here because each time the expression repeats, it's another set of parentheses. Let me confirm that.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. From the problem statement, I see nine opening parentheses before the first 1 + 3. So, that means there are nine layers. So, I need to compute from the innermost one and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each layer depends on the result of the previous one.\n\nAlright, let me write this down step by step. I'll start from the innermost expression and work my way out. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, with 1 being the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the problem says 3 multiplied by that entire expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nHmm, let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nFinally, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way to be sure. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we get 88572. That's the same result as before, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me double-check each step quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's count how many \"1+3(\" are there:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) inside the next (1+3(...))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.

Maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a step. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

Wait, no, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and the expression has 9 such layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so let's compute up to Layer9.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(4) = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(13) = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(40) = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(121) = 363\n\nLayer9: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, Layer10: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nLayer11: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer12: 3*(1093) = 3279\n\nLayer13: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer14: 3*(3280) = 9840\n\nWait, but the original expression is only up to 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", so perhaps after Layer9, we stop. But in the original expression, after the 9th \"1 + 3\", we have another 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct number of layers is 9, so we compute up to Layer9, which is 364, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, no, because the outermost is 3*(...), so perhaps the total number of layers is 9, and the final result is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(4) = 12\n\nLayer3: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer4: 3*(13) = 39\n\nLayer5: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 3*(40) = 120\n\nLayer7: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer8: 3*(121) = 363\n\nLayer9: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, Layer10: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", so perhaps Layer10 is the outermost 3*(...), making the total layers 10.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can represent the expression as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1).\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)).\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)).\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to define it correctly.\n\nLet me think of each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(previous result) + 1.\n\nWait, no, because the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, perhaps f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nWait, but this seems to be going beyond the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the function.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).

It seems like a nested expression where each level is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, there are multiple layers of this, each one inside the other. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part, I see a 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+...) part. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep this goes.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the first 3, there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with (1+3(...)). So, that means there are nine layers of nesting here. Hmm, that's quite a few. Maybe I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1+3, right? So that's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(the next layer). So, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(inner expression). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to outline the layers:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n10. Finally, multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3 after computing Layer 9. So, let me structure this properly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break this down. 29524 * 3. \n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 is equal to (29520 + 4) * 3 = 29520*3 + 4*3 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192; 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279; 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840; 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523; 27000+2523=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 in another way. Maybe using the standard multiplication method.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me consider if there's a pattern here or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nLet me write down the recurrence:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1, for n >= 2\n\nWith L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^10)/2 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to confirm, let me compute 3^10: 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. 243*243: 200*200=40,000; 200*43=8,600; 43*200=8,600; 43*43=1,849. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 243*243 can be computed as:\n\n(200 + 40 + 3)*(200 + 40 + 3). But that's tedious. Alternatively, 243*243: 243*200=48,600; 243*40=9,720; 243*3=729. Adding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, 3^10=59,049.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (59,049)/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29,524=88,572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\nStarting from L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, etc. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, indeed, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3, but offset by 1 each time.\n\nBut since I already found the closed-form using recurrence relations, and it's consistent, I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\) where each layer is computed as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
