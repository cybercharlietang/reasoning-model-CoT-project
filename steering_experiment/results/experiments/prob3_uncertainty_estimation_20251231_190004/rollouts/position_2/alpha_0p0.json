It seems like a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer wraps that result into another 3*(1 + ...). Since it's nested multiple times, I think the way to go is to start from the inside and work my way outwards, simplifying each part as I go.\n\nLet me write this down step by step to visualize it better. Maybe I can represent each level as a separate equation. Let's denote each level starting from the innermost one as Level 1, then Level 2, and so on up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, let me count the number of 3s to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each opening parenthesis after the first 3 introduces another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are nine of them. So that means there are nine layers. So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the ninth layer, and then each layer wraps around the previous one.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9.\n\nWait, no, actually, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So maybe it's better to compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo let's try that approach.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9)\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back at the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so that would correspond to Level 9 being the innermost expression, and then each subsequent Level adds another layer. So maybe my initial approach is correct.\n\nLet me try to compute each level one by one.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. Because when I look at the original expression, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nSo, if Level 9 is the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent Level adds a layer. So Level 1 is 1+3, Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1), Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2), and so on up to Level 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, yes, the final result is 3*Level 9.\n\nSo, from my calculations above:\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000*3=87000\n\n524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72 \u2192 total 1500+72=1572\n\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing Level 9. Because if any of the Levels above were miscalculated, then the final result would be wrong.\n\nLet me go through each Level again step by step to verify.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each Level is correct. Therefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula instead of computing each Level manually. Since each Level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous Level), this seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each Level as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Assume a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Level 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=9, so n+1=10.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of Level 9 being 29524. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each Level is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, the expression is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 4 and having 9 terms.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, the number of terms is 9, starting from a_1 to a_9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the total expression as a sum. Let me see.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it since we've already got the correct result through both iterative computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the iterative step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost part and working our way outwards.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each level starting from the innermost one as follows:\n\n- **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Level 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each part is similar, so maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit instead of computing each layer one by one. But just to be safe, I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: \n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. \n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have: \n\n2. The next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3 times (1 plus 3 times the next layer). Let me clarify the structure.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression for clarity, starting from the innermost part:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd this goes on until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers. Because the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 1+3 inside. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3.

Wait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 sets of 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each layer being a term in a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define a sequence where:\n\nLet a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, I can compute a_1 through a_9 step by step.\n\nLet me compute each a_i:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nLet me verify a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each a_n follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth term can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to figure this out. \n\nFirst, I notice that this expression is built up with a series of 1s and 3s, each time adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It seems like a repeated process, so maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the innermost part of the expression. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result.

So, starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one level, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now the next level out would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so each time I go out a level, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here.\n\nSo far, I have:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me count how many levels there are here. The original expression has multiple layers, each time adding another (1 + 3(...)). Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), and each time, it's multiplied by 3 on the outside. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses: \n\nStarting from the left, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, each time, a new (1 + 3(... begins. Let me see:\n\n1. The first layer is 3(...)\n\n2. Inside that, it's 1 + 3(...)\n\n3. Then, another 1 + 3(...)\n\nContinuing this, I think there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) because each time, we have a new 1 + 3(... until the innermost (1 + 3). So, starting from the innermost, which is level 1, and moving outwards, each time adding another layer. So, in total, there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is level 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time, we have another 1 + 3*(...), so that's 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s outside each parenthesis:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's one 3.\n\nThen, each time we go out a layer, we have another 3 multiplied by the next expression. So, let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, finally, the outermost 3 multiplies this result: 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so after Level 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply by 3 again. So, let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nHmm, let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLevel 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=121\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=364\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression, rather than computing each level step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nI notice that each level is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nTherefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 0 = 1 + 2C \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 =4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this is correct. I double-checked each step, and the closed-form formula also gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication of 3s and additions of 1s. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each step follows the pattern of multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This leads to a recurrence relation which can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Applying this formula for the given number of layers results in the final value.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer step by step**:\n   - Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer result by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's see. It's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of operations. Hmm, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*(previous result). Wait, let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, no. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, maybe I need to compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. Let's count how many times this nesting occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), and each of those is multiplied by 3. Let's count how many levels there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, the next one is 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next level is 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost level.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3*(...). So, that means there are 9 nested levels. Wait, let me count:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. And this continues until we have 9 levels. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times the pattern 1+3(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost and working outward, computing each level step by step. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, starting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving to L2, which is 1 + 3*(L1). So:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, after computing L9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24? Wait, that's not correct because 20,000 + 9,000 is 29,000, plus 500 is 29,500, plus 24 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That matches what I had before. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the levels.\n\nLet me recount the levels. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 L1: 4\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1 + 3*(L1) \u2192 L2: 13\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(L2) \u2192 L3: 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(L3) \u2192 L4: 121\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(L4) \u2192 L5: 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(L5) \u2192 L6: 1093\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(L6) \u2192 L7: 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(L7) \u2192 L8: 9841\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(L8) \u2192 L9: 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 levels, from L1 to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the levels. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each level is indeed one more step. So, I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that there are only 9 levels, computing each step might be more straightforward.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each level is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value at level n, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*(3)^n\n\nA particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A \u2192 0 = 1 + 2A \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*(3)^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition at n=1, L1=4:\n\n4 = C*(3)^1 + (-1/2)\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*(3)^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check if this formula works for the first few levels.\n\nAt n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2713\n\nAt n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2713\n\nAt n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2713\n\nAt n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2713\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, at level n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2713\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, the value at L9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 =88572\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nSince each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L1=4, then expanding this, each term adds a power of 3.\n\nAlternatively, the formula we derived is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which gives L9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each level step by step without using the formula, just to make sure.\n\nLet me do that again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nL2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or some pattern, but I think the step-by-step approach is solid.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me check L7 again. So, L6 is 1093.\n\nSo, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, L7=1+3279=3280 \u2713\n\nSimilarly, L8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3:\n\n3000*3=9000\n\n200*3=600 \u2192 9000+600=9600\n\n80*3=240 \u2192 9600+240=9840\n\nSo, 3*3280=9840, then L8=1+9840=9841 \u2713\n\nThen, L9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3.\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400 \u2192 27,000+2,400=29,400\n\n40*3=120 \u2192 29,400+120=29,520\n\n1*3=3 \u2192 29,520+3=29,523\n\nThen, L9=1+29,523=29,524 \u2713\n\nSo, 3*29,524=88,572 \u2713\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute the entire expression from the inside out using another method, like substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the expression as a function and compute it recursively, but since I'm doing this manually, step-by-step substitution seems the way to go.\n\nWait, another approach: notice that each level is 1 + 3 times the previous level. So, if I denote each level as L1 to L9, as before, and each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4, then the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, yes, as we did before, and that gives us 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression without using the formula, just by expanding each step.\n\nLet me try that again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) =1 +39=40\n\n4. Next:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121\n\n5. Next:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364\n\n6. Next:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\n7. Next:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\n8. Next:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\n9. Next:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication 3*29524 again.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 =12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying the arithmetic, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost level: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Each time, it's 3 multiplied by something, and that something is 1 plus another 3 multiplied by something else. So it's like a recursive structure. Let me write it out more clearly to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, I think it goes like this:\n\nInnermost expression: 1+3\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(innermost expression)\n\nThen the next layer: 1 + 3*(previous expression)\n\nAnd this repeats several times. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's count the number of 1+3(...) parts.\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer outwards adds another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. How many times does this happen? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo after the first 3, each (1+3 starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n- 3(\n- Then inside, 1+3(\n- Then another 1+3(\n- And so on until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo from the expression, after the first 3, how many (1+3( are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting after the first 3, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3( appears.\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo from the first 3, each layer is a 1+3(, and the innermost is 1+3). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach (1+3 starts a new layer. So the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...), then inside that, another (1+3(...), and so on. Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before the innermost 1+3. Wait, let me count:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3( in the expression:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n\nWait, actually, that's 9 times, but let me check again. From the expression, after the first 3, each (1+3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3( in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, the first (1+3( is layer 1, then inside that, another (1+3( is layer 2, and so on until the innermost 1+3. Let me count the number of (1+3(:\n\n- After the first 3, the first (1+3( is layer 1.\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3( is layer 2.\n- Continuing this, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Let me see:\n\nThe expression ends with ...))))))).\n\nEach closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the innermost 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then a closing parenthesis: )\n2. Then another ), so that's two.\n3. Continuing until the end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me try to evaluate it step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since I think there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, maybe it's 8 layers? Let me check again. Let me write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo each * represents a multiplication, and each (1 + 3*... is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3*... parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n5.

(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n9. Finally, the outermost 3*(1 + ... )\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers? Let me confirm by counting the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, we have a 1+3 multiplied by 3. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the outermost 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So in total, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to just start computing from the innermost layer and work outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 Total: 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3 again:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo the result is 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since the numbers are manageable, step-by-step computation seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works.\n\nSo L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it all in one go using the formula.\n\nSince the total expression is 3*L9, and L9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then:\n\nTotal expression =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147\n\nThus, total expression = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a particular method, and just asked to compute it, either way is fine.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. The answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

It seems like each part is of the form 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3, but wait, actually, the next part is 1 + 3 multiplied by the result we just got. Let me see:\n\nWait, no, maybe I should number the parentheses to keep track. Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 1))\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(result from step 2))\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, but looking at the problem, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so each level is 3*(1 + ...). So maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer from the inside out. Let's define each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have:\n\nS2: 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext level out:\n\nS3: 1 + 3*(S2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*(S3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*(S4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*(S5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*(S6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*(S7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*(S8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let's compute this. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by S9, which is 29524. So:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524\n\nCompute that: 29524 * 3\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo putting it together: 88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe break down 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 total so far 60000+27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.\n\nStarting from S1 to S9:\n\nS1: 1+3=4\n\nS2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nS3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nS4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nS5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nS6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nS7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nS8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nS9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each step manually, but since it's only 9 layers, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each a_n, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nSo (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested term from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 plus three times the previous result. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost value by 3. Using both step-by-step expansion and recognizing the recurrence relation, the final answer is determined to be:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It seems like a repetitive pattern, so maybe I can find a pattern or simplify it step by step. Let me try to work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 is 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost parentheses). Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, let me write it down step by step to avoid confusion. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and each closing parenthesis removes one. Let me count:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. From the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each with 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, starting from the first 3, we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections. Each time, it's another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer wraps around with 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3*(...) occurs.\n\nLet me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers? Let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time, we have an opening parenthesis after the 3, so let's count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built by adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3)))\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1+3(...\n- Then another (1+3(...\n- And so on, until the last (1+3(...\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3? Let's see:\n\nThe expression inside is: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. ...3(1+3(\n3. ...3(1+3(\n4. ...3(1+3(\n5. ...3(1+3(\n6. ...3(1+3(\n7. ...3(1+3(\n8. ...3(1+3(\n9. ...3(1+3))\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), so the layers are:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The initial expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2 wraps around it, up to layer 9, and then the outermost 3 multiplies the result of layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3 multiplies this result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Let me write down each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer from innermost to outermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524\n\nNow, let's compute 3 * 29524.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n= 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nLet me recalculate each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to compute it another way, maybe using a formula instead of expanding each layer step by step.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-A = 1\n\nSo, A = -1.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1 = 3C - 1 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C - 1 = 4\n\n3C = 5\n\nC = 5/3.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (5/3)*3^n - 1 = 5*3^{n-1} - 1.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1:\n\nL1 = 5*3^{0} - 1 = 5*1 -1 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2:\n\nL2 = 5*3^{1} -1 = 15 -1 =14. Wait, but earlier I had L2 =13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, according to my earlier step-by-step, L2 was 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nBut according to the formula, L2 = 5*3^{1} -1 =15 -1=14. That's a problem. It should be 13, not 14. So, my formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let's re-examine the recurrence. The recurrence is L_n =1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the recurrence.\n\nLet me re-derive the solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution:\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nCharacteristic equation: r -3=0 => r=3.\n\nThus, homogeneous solution: C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), assume a particular solution of the form L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A =1\n\n-2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nWait, earlier I thought A=-1, but that's incorrect. It's A=-1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1=4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\nL1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nC= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nL5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nL6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nL7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nL8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nL9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, that matches my earlier step-by-step calculations. So, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives the correct value for each layer.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 =3 *29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression using the formula.\n\nSince L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3 *29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding all the layers, it's a sum of terms with 3^k.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe innermost layer is 1 +3.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3) =1 +3 +3^2.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3 +3^2)=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3.\n\nContinuing this way, each layer adds another term with 3^{k}.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^9.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer), which includes the previous terms multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series.\n\nLet me think recursively.\n\nLet\u2019s denote S_n as the sum 1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^{n}.\n\nThen, S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the formula we used earlier.\n\nWait, indeed, S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our case, L9 = S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * S_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))) which is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k).\n\nWait, but no, because each layer is 1 +3*(previous), which is equivalent to the sum up to 3^{n}.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because each layer is 1 +3*(previous), which is similar to S_n =1 +3*S_{n-1}, which is exactly the recurrence we have.\n\nSo, the sum S_n =1 +3*S_{n-1}, which leads to S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S_9=88,572.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is the same.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), leading to a recursive sequence. By calculating each layer step by step or using the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we find the innermost value and work outward. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting lost. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, I notice that the pattern repeats: 3 multiplied by (1 + something). It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses here. Let me count them to be sure. Starting from the innermost, each time I have 1 + 3(...), so counting each opening parenthesis, I think there are nine layers. So, maybe I can compute each layer starting from the inside.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, I think I did it correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach, like recognizing the pattern as a geometric series or something.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, yeah, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try solving it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nCharacteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3.\n\nSo, homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, recognize the pattern, or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\), and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). \n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\):\n   - Compute \\( 3 \\times 29524 \\):\n     - \\( 29524 \\times 3 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay, so it's a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to understand the structure here. It seems like each layer is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1, right? So it's like 3 times (1 + 3 times (another similar expression)). \n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused. Let me write down each layer separately to keep track.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times the result of the previous step plus 1.\n3. I'll keep doing this until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nLet me write this out step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n- (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer out is 3 times that result plus 1.\n- 3*(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. The next layer would be 3*(1 + 3*(...)). But in the problem, it's written as 3(1+3(...)), so actually, each step is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), not 3*(result) + 1. Hmm, maybe I misread that.\n\nLet me clarify. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So actually, each step is 3*(1 + previous_result). \n\nWait, that might be a better way to think about it. So starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous_layer). So maybe I need to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous_layer). Let me try that.\n\nLet me list out each layer from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine layers in total, I think. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8)\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So maybe each step is 3*(1 + previous step). Let me try that.\n\nSo let's start:\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9 = 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers, so S9 would be the outermost layer. But let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). So the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1+3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until there are nine layers? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer. Let me count how many 3(...) are there.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1+3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3)))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3))))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count the number of 3(...) expressions. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine 3*(...) terms. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the problem, the number of opening parentheses after 3 is 9. Each 3 is followed by (1 + ...). So yes, there are nine layers. So S1 to S9 as I defined earlier.\n\nWait, but when I computed S9 as 36084, but let me check each step again because I might have made a mistake in multiplication.\n\nLet me go step by step:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9 = 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check S9 again: 1 + S8 is 1 + 12027 = 12028, then 3*12028.\n\nLet me compute 12028 * 3:\n\n12028 * 3:\n\n12000 * 3 = 36000\n\n28 * 3 = 84\n\nSo 36000 + 84 = 36084. That's correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of 3(...) in the original problem.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3(...). So the number of 3(...) is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...):\n\nStarting from the first 3 after the initial 3, each (1+3(...)) adds another layer.\n\nSo from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(1 + (1+3))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because there are nine (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3(...) expressions:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time I see a 3 followed by (1+...). Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is 3(1+3)\n2. Next layer: 3(1+3(1+3))\n3. Then 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and the ... includes another 3*(1 + ...). So how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of times 3*(1 + ...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + (1 + 3))\n3. Then, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1 + 3)))\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3 after the initial 3, each (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3(...) expressions:\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + (1 + 3))\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of 3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the problem, the number of 3(...) is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3(...) occurs\n- And so on.\n\nSo starting from the first 3 after the initial 3:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), and inside that, there's another 3*(1 + ...). So the number of layers is equal to the number of 3(...) expressions.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. The first 3(...) is 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo how many 3(...) expressions are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the outermost 3(...), each layer adds another 3(...). So in the problem, from the outermost 3(...) down to the innermost, how many are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) expressions:\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nInnermost: (1+3) is just 1+3, not a 3(...), so the first 3(...) is the next layer.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, the first 3(...) is the second layer, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo starting from the initial 3, the first ( is at position 1: 3(1+3(...))\n\nThen inside that, another ( at position 3: 3(1+3(...))\n\nContinuing until the innermost (...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times 3( occurs in the expression.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo the first 3( is at the beginning.\n\nThen, inside that, another 3( after the first 1+.\n\nSo each time, it's 3(1+3(...)), so each 3( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, no, the initial 3( is the first, then inside that, another 3(, and so on until the innermost.\n\nBut in the expression, it's written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))), so the number of 3( is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the initial 3(, that's the first.\n\nThen, inside that, 3( occurs again: that's the second.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of 3( in the entire expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach 3( is a new layer.\n\nSo let's see:\n\n- The first 3( is at the beginning.\n- Then, inside that, another 3( after 1+3.\n- Each time, it's 3(1+3(...)), so each 3( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count how many 3( are there:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So there are 9 layers, each starting with 3(.\n\nTherefore, S1 to S9 as I computed earlier, leading to S9 = 36084.\n\nBut let me confirm by computing each step again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting with S1:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nS3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nS4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nS5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nS6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nS7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nS8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nS9 = 3*(1 + S8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9.\n\nI recall that such expressions can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nLet me define the expression recursively. Let\u2019s say a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2\n\nSo,\n\n3C - 3/2 = 4\n\n3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nC = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2\n\nSimplify further:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, for n=9, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nTotal: 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nNow, subtract 9:\n\n216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nDivide by 6:\n\n216504 / 6 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n216504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 * 36000 = 216000\n\n216504 - 216000 = 504\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84\n\nSo total is 36000 + 84 = 36084\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, a_9 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous_layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. S2 = 3*(1 + S1) = 15\n3. S3 = 3*(1 + S2) = 48\n4. S4 = 3*(1 + S3) = 147\n5. S5 = 3*(1 + S4) = 444\n6. S6 = 3*(1 + S5) = 1335\n7. S7 = 3*(1 + S6) = 4008\n8. S8 = 3*(1 + S7) = 12027\n9. S9 = 3*(1 + S8) = 36084\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, you always start solving from the innermost parentheses and move outward. So, let's take it one step at a time.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's a series of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). Each of those \"something\" parts is another similar expression. Let me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI can see that starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check again. Each time I see a \"1+3(...)\", that's a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n2. Then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n3. This repeats until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost and moving outward, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have L2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nSo, L2 = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check:\n\n3*(13) is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nMoving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by (L9). So, after calculating L9, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 0 (since there's nothing left) * 3 = 0, but since we've already processed all digits, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(... So, the first layer is the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write down the expression with layer numbers to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3). Let's call this Layer 1: (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(Layer1)): Layer 2\n3. Then Layer3 is (1 + 3*(Layer2))\n4. And so on until Layer9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ... ))), with each \"1 + 3(...)\" being a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time you go out a layer, you add another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time there's an opening parenthesis after a 3, that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(... So that's Layer1.\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...: Layer2\n3. Then another: Layer3\n4. Continuing until we reach the end.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"(\" after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n- The first \"(\" after 3 is Layer1.\n- Then, inside that, another \"(\" is Layer2.\n- Continuing, each \"(\" adds a new layer.\n\nSo, how many \"(\" are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me write the expression and count:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nNumber of \"(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. ( after 3: Layer1\n2. ( after 1+3: Layer2\n3. ( after 1+3: Layer3\n4. ( after 1+3: Layer4\n5. ( after 1+3: Layer5\n6. ( after 1+3: Layer6\n7. ( after 1+3: Layer7\n8. ( after 1+3: Layer8\n9. ( after 1+3: Layer9\n10. ( after 1+3: Layer10\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, it's actually 9. Because the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3: Layer1\n2. Then, each time we have 1+3(Layer1): Layer2\n3. Then 1+3(Layer2): Layer3\n4. Continuing until Layer9, because the original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we apply the 1+3(...) operation. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3: Layer1\n- Then another \"1+3(\" inside that: Layer2\n- And so on, until we reach the end.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the first \"(\", that's Layer1, then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. ( after 3: Layer1\n2. ( after 1+3: Layer2\n3. ( after 1+3: Layer3\n4. ( after 1+3: Layer4\n5. ( after 1+3: Layer5\n6. ( after 1+3: Layer6\n7. ( after 1+3: Layer7\n8. ( after 1+3: Layer8\n9. ( after 1+3: Layer9\n10. ( after 1+3: Layer10\n\nWait, that's 10 layers, but that seems too many. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting because the innermost part is just 1+3 without a following \"(\", so maybe the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time you have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each time you go out, you add another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times. So, starting from Layer1 to Layer9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not overcomplicate. Let me try to compute each layer again, this time being careful about the number of layers.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me double-check each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me consider that each layer is following the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n to avoid computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the nth layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, L_9 would be:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident in this result. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure that there were no arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. The closed-form approach confirmed the result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer.\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me start by looking at the innermost part and work my way outward. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is just 1+3, right? Let me check:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1+3, which is 4. Then, moving one step out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Starting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving to Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let me break it down. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let's calculate this. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this Level 9 result. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: \n\nFirst, 20000*3 is 60000,\n\n9000*3 is 27000,\n\n500*3 is 1500,\n\n20*3 is 60,\n\n4*3 is 12.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000,\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500,\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560,\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I break it down, I might miscount the digits.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524\n\nx     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify each step again quickly to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any level.\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSeems correct.

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the inside and move outward, solving each layer one by one.\n\nAlright, so the innermost expression is 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, I see that this result is multiplied by 3. So the next step is:\n\nNext layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n\nBut wait, that 12 is inside another parentheses, which is added to 1. So the next step is:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNow, this 13 is again multiplied by 3:\n\nNext layer: 3 * 13 = 39\n\nAnd then added to 1:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMultiply by 3 again:\n\nNext layer: 3 * 40 = 120\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nNext layer: 3 * 121 = 363\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nNext layer: 3 * 364 = 1092\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nNext layer: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nNext layer: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me count how many layers I've done so far. Each time I did a step, I went through a multiplication and addition. Let me see: starting from the innermost, 1+3, that's one layer. Then each time I did a 3*(previous result) +1, that's another layer. Let me check the original expression to make sure I didn't miss any layers.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 8 layers, right? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and moving out, each time we have another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3\" inside the parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then moving out, each time it's 1+3*(...), so that's 8 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I ended up with Layer 8 being 9841, but let me check the original expression again. The outermost is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 8 layers, we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 8 layers, which gives us a value, and then we multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counting. Let me try to list each step clearly.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, after Layer 8, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8). So we have:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 9841 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 9841 * 3.\n\nCalculating:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 800 = 2400\n\n3 * 40 = 120\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1.

(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( is the first layer, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first ( starts layer 1.\n\n- The next ( inside that starts layer 2.\n\n- Then another ( starts layer 3.\n\n- And so on until the last (.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the first (, there are 7 more ( before the first )).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that the expression is 3 followed by 8 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears inside the parentheses:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen moving out, each time it's 1+3*(...), so that's 8 layers in total.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by stopping at Layer 8 and then multiplying by 3, but actually, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8). So, the final result is 3*(Layer 8), which is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me verify that.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me define the expression as follows:\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and moving outwards.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression E is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 9840 * 3 = 29520, and then add 3*1=3, so 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait a second, but I feel like I might have missed a layer. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of times \"1+3\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3, and each layer adds another 3*(...)+1.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, so after computing up to Layer 8, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(...).\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nIn general, such a recurrence relation can be solved as follows.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nAlso, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstituting the general solution into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition:\n\n3A + B = 4\n\nWe have B = -1/2, so:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 8 layers, so n=8.\n\nThus, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier for Layer 8.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier, but since I was doing it step by step, it worked out.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. \n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is \"1 + 3\". Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is \"1 + 3(4)\". Wait, so inside that, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. \n\nLet me write that down: 1 + 3*4. Hmm, I should remember to do multiplication before addition. So, 3*4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, that middle part simplifies to 13. \n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is \"1 + 3(13)\". Again, I need to compute the multiplication first. 3*13 is 39, and then adding 1 gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next one out is \"1 + 3(40)\". Let's compute that. 3*40 is 120, and adding 1 gives 121. So, that layer is 121. \n\nNext, moving out another layer, we have \"1 + 3(121)\". Computing that: 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, that part is 364. \n\nContinuing, the next expression is \"1 + 3(364)\". Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. So, that's 1093. \n\nMoving out another layer, we have \"1 + 3(1093)\". Let's see, 3*1093 is... Hmm, let me compute that. 1093*3: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, that layer is 3280. \n\nNext, the expression is \"1 + 3(3280)\". Let me compute that: 3*3280 is... 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, that part is 9841. \n\nMoving out another layer, we have \"1 + 3(9841)\". Calculating that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that layer is 29524. \n\nNext, the expression is \"1 + 3(29524)\". Let's compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that part is 88573. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have \"1 + 3(88573)\". Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, that layer is 265720. \n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have \"3(265720)\". Now, that's straightforward. 3 multiplied by 265720. Let me compute that. \n\nBreaking it down, 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding all those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 797,160. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when you do multiple layers of multiplication and addition, it's easy to slip up. \n\nStarting from the inside: 1 + 3 is 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 is 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. \n\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought 3*364 was 1093, but 3*364 is actually 1092, right? Because 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that part is correct. \n\nNext, 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280: 3280*3=9840, so 1+9840=9841. Correct. \n\nNext, 1 + 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those: 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. Then, 1 + 88572=88573. Correct. \n\nNext, 1 + 3*88573: 88573*3. Let me compute that again. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding: 240000+24000=264000+1500=265500+210=265710+9=265719. Then, 1 + 265719=265720. Correct. \n\nFinally, 3*265720: Let's compute that. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding: 600000+180000=780000+15000=795000+2100=797100+60=797160. \n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Each step checks out, and the final result is 797,160. \n\nI think I did that right. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but as long as I take it one step at a time, it works out. I just need to make sure I remember to multiply before adding each time, and keep track of each layer carefully. \n\nSo, the final answer should be 797,160. Let me just write that in the required format.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires simplifying a deeply nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the innermost expression, substituting it into the next layer, and repeating until the entire expression is simplified. \n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Substitute into the next layer: \\(1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer, each time substituting the result into the next multiplication and addition.\n\nFollowing this method step by step leads to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n10. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\).\n11. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\).\n12. Outermost: \\(3 \\times 265720 = 797160\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{797160}"

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me try to understand what's going on here. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost part, each time we have 1 + 3 times the result of the next layer. Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can compute them one by one, starting from the inside and working my way out.\n\nLet me write this down more clearly. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- And so on, until Layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each step adds another layer: 1 + 3*(...), so how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. ... and so on until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time we add another 1 + 3*(...), and I can see that from the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step wraps another 1 + 3*(...). Let me confirm:\n\nLet me write the expression with each layer numbered:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, we need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nAlright, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple.\n\nNow Layer 2:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll steps check out. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. Then, the final result is multiplying that by 3 again.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, we can write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and the formula approach also confirms it. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer sequentially and applying the final multiplication by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Define Each Layer**: The expression is a series of nested operations. Let each layer be defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)), starting from Layer 1.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me see. It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Each time, it seems like there's a 1 plus 3 times something. I think I can tackle this by working from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually works with these kinds of problems.\n\nSo, starting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nFirst step: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nOkay, so that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from above)). So, replacing the innermost part with 4, the next part is:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the next level out is 13. Let me note that down.\n\nSecond step: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the next expression is again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, taking the 13 from the previous step:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThird step: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the result from the previous step, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me continue this process.\n\nFourth step: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFifth step: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous value. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nLet me number each step from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine sets of parentheses, so I think there are nine steps here. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step carefully.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. First innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after the ninth step, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, remember the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, the final step is:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3.\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps because that number seems quite large, but considering the nesting, it might be correct.\n\nLet me retrace the steps:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 levels of nesting, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and also derived a formula which gave the same result. So, I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous step. After evaluating all nested expressions, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Substitute back and compute the next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent level:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n4. Multiply the final result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. \n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. \n\nSo now, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, but I think I miscounted. Let me check how many times this pattern repeats. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nStarting from the left, the first term is 3, then inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3(...). Each time, another set of parentheses. Let me count them: \n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me see how many layers there are. \n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many times does (1+3) appear? Let's count the number of closing parentheses after each 3. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times 3 is followed by a (1+...). Let me see: \n\n- The innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so let's see how many layers there are. \n\nLooking at the original expression, after the first 3, there are 8 sets of parentheses. Wait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers? Let me check: \n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), and each ... is another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times this happens. \n\nFrom the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outwards. Let me define each step as computing each layer and then substituting it into the outer expression. \n\nLet me try that approach. Let's start by computing the innermost expression and work our way out. \n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3). That's 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nSo, now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. \n\nActually, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where ... is the next inner expression. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number each layer. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, perhaps? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time, we have 3*(1 + ...), and each ... is another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, let's count how many layers we have. \n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3's after the first one. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 more 3's inside the parentheses. Let me check:\n\n- The first 3 is outside all the parentheses.\n- Then, inside the first parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 2.\n- Inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 3.\n- Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 appears inside the parentheses. Let me count the number of 3's inside the parentheses:\n\nLooking at the original expression, after the first 3, each parenthesis starts with 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 3 appears inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have a 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3's inside:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside.\n2. Then, inside the first parenthesis, we have 3*(...), so that's the second 3.\n3. Inside that, another 3*(...), third 3.\n4. Continuing this way, how many 3's are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers because the innermost is the 9th? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), which is 4. Then, each layer outwards is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each time, I'm computing a new layer by taking 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). \n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3, there are 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9? Because starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I'm not making a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nOriginal expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses at the end. It ends with 9 closing parentheses, right? Let me see:\n\n- Each layer adds another set of parentheses, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 appears after the first one. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...). Each time, it's another layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after computing each layer, the final result would be Layer 9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me recount the layers step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Layer 1\n\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15 \u2192 Layer 2\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 \u2192 Layer 3\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 \u2192 Layer 4\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 \u2192 Layer 5\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 \u2192 Layer 6\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 \u2192 Layer 7\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 \u2192 Layer 8\n\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2192 Layer 9\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and we have 9 layers in total. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check the arithmetic in each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2192 Correct.\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing it in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, this expression resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe I can express it recursively.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, f(9) = 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = 3 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 3 \u2192 -2*A = 3 \u2192 A = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C \u2192 11/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor 3^n:\n\nf(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nLet me compute f(9) using this formula:\n\nf(9) = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, f(9) = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 \u00f7 6:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\n3280.5 * 10 = 32805\n\n3280.5 * 1 = 3280.5\n\nTotal: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 from this:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier result. So, f(9) = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that requires evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with the sum of 1 and the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part seems to be (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)). Since we just found that the innermost part is 4, let's substitute that in.\n\nSo, the next level is: (1 + 3*4)\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check that again. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next inner expression). So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. The entire expression is built up as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4)\n\nWait, no, actually, let me parse the structure correctly. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me number the layers from 1 to 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4)\n\nWait, but actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner layer)). So, let me correct that. Each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of 3(...) parts: starting from the left, each 3(...) is a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...) parts. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) - that's the outermost.\n\nThen each inner part is another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied, which is 9 times, since each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a new layer.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Each time, there's a 3 followed by a parenthesis.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3(1+3(...)) instances.\n\nLooking at the string, each time after the first 3, there's a 1+3(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers? Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that's getting big quickly. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, let's list each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*Layer2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*Layer3) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*Layer4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*Layer5) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*Layer6) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*Layer8) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if I'm correctly counting the layers. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost (1+3). So, the number of layers is indeed 9. So, after layer 9, we've computed the entire expression.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because the numbers are growing rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704\n\nWait, 3*9568: 9568 * 3: 9000*3=27,000; 500*3=1500; 60*3=180; 8*3=24. So, 27,000 + 1500 = 28,500; +180 = 28,680; +24 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339\n\nWait, 86,112 + 1 = 86,113. 86,113 * 3: 80,000*3=240,000; 6,000*3=18,000; 113*3=339. So, 240,000 + 18,000 = 258,000; +339 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nWait, 3*775,018: Let's compute 700,000*3=2,100,000; 75,000*3=225,000; 500*3=1,500; 18*3=54. So, 2,100,000 + 225,000 = 2,325,000; +1,500 = 2,326,500; +54 = 2,326,554. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 775,018 * 3: Let's compute it correctly.\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n\n5,000 * 3 = 15,000\n\n18 * 3 = 54\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n2,100,000 + 210,000 = 2,310,000\n\n2,310,000 + 15,000 = 2,325,000\n\n2,325,000 + 54 = 2,325,054\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 7 is 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nLet me check that multiplication:\n\n6,975,163 * 3:\n\n6,000,000 * 3 = 18,000,000\n\n975,000 * 3 = 2,925,000\n\n163 * 3 = 489\n\nAdding them: 18,000,000 + 2,925,000 = 20,925,000; +489 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n62,776,468 * 3:\n\n60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\n\n2,776,468 * 3: Let's compute that.\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n\n776,468 * 3: 700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000; 76,468 * 3 = 229,404\n\nSo, 2,100,000 + 229,404 = 2,329,404\n\nNow, 6,000,000 + 2,329,404 = 8,329,404\n\nNow, add that to 180,000,000: 180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing all 9 layers, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount the number of 3(...) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1: 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*4) \u2192 Layer 2: 39\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*39) \u2192 Layer 3: 354\n\n4. 3*(1 + 3*354) \u2192 Layer 4: 3189\n\n5. 3*(1 + 3*3189) \u2192 Layer 5: 28,704\n\n6. 3*(1 + 3*28,704) \u2192 Layer 6: 258,339\n\n7. 3*(1 + 3*258,339) \u2192 Layer 7: 2,325,054\n\n8. 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) \u2192 Layer 8: 20,925,489\n\n9. 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) \u2192 Layer 9: 188,329,404\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so the final answer should be 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed using geometric series or other formulas.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 3.\n\nWait, actually, let's model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, for n \u2265 2, a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1})\n\nSo, let's write that out:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to expand the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0 \u21d2 r = 9\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*9^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), let's assume the particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 9*C + 3 \u21d2 C - 9C = 3 \u21d2 -8C = 3 \u21d2 C = -3/8\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*9^n + (-3/8)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait, in our case, a_1 corresponds to n=1, which is the innermost layer. Let's make sure about the indexing.\n\nWait, in the problem, a_1 is (1+3) = 4, which is the innermost. So, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nBut in the recurrence, a_n is defined based on a_{n-1}, so for n=2, a_2 is built from a_1.\n\nSo, let's apply the initial condition at n=1:\n\na_1 = A*9^1 + (-3/8) = 9A - 3/8 = 4\n\nSo, 9A = 4 + 3/8 = 35/8 \u21d2 A = (35/8) / 9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\nFirst, 9^9 is a big number. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nCompute 9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489\n\nNow, compute (35/72)*387,420,489\n\nFirst, let's compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\nDivide 387,420,489 by 72:\n\n72 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 360,000,000\n\nSubtract: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489\n\nNow, 72 \u00d7 380,000 = 27,360,000\n\nSubtract: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489\n\n72 \u00d7 839 = 60,489 (since 72 \u00d7 800 = 57,600; 72 \u00d7 39 = 2,808; total 57,600 + 2,808 = 60,408. Hmm, that's 60,408, but we have 60,489.\n\nWait, perhaps 72 \u00d7 839 = 60,408. Then, 60,489 - 60,408 = 81, which is 72 \u00d7 1.125, but that's fractional.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 as follows:\n\n72 \u00d7 5,380,000 = 72 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 360,000,000; 72 \u00d7 380,000 = 27,360,000. So, 5,380,000 \u00d772= 360,000,000 +27,360,000=387,360,000.\n\nSubtract from 387,420,489: 387,420,489 - 387,360,000 = 60,489.\n\nNow, 72 \u00d7 839 = 60,408 as before. So, 72 \u00d7 839 = 60,408, which is 81 less than 60,489.\n\nSo, 60,489 \u00f772 = 839 + 81/72 = 839 + 9/8 = 839 + 1.125 = 840.125\n\nSo, total is 5,380,000 + 380,000 + 840.125 = 5,760,840.125\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 35/72 * 387,420,489 as (35 * 387,420,489) / 72.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute 387,420,489 \u00f772 first.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 387,420,489 \u00f772:\n\nDivide 387,420,489 by 72:\n\n72 \u00d7 5,000,000 = 360,000,000\n\nSubtract: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489\n\n72 \u00d7 380,000 = 27,360,000\n\nSubtract: 27,420,489 -27,360,000 = 60,489\n\n72 \u00d7 839 = 60,408\n\nSubtract: 60,489 -60,408=81\n\nNow, 81 \u00f772=1.125\n\nSo, total is 5,000,000 + 380,000 + 839 +1.125=5,380,839 +1.125=5,380,840.125\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f772=5,380,840.125\n\nNow, multiply by 35: 5,380,840.125 \u00d735\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 5,380,840 \u00d735:\n\nCompute 5,380,840 \u00d730=161,425,200\n\nCompute 5,380,840 \u00d75=26,904,200\n\nAdd them: 161,425,200 +26,904,200=188,329,400\n\nNow, the 0.125 part: 0.125 \u00d735=4.375\n\nSo, total is 188,329,400 +4.375=188,329,404.375\n\nNow, subtract 3/8 from this:\n\n188,329,404.375 - 3/8 = 188,329,404.375 - 0.375=188,329,404\n\nWhich matches our earlier result of 188,329,404.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we also get 188,329,404 as the result for a_9.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 188,329,404.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{188329404}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting overwhelmed.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, each time, I have to compute the innermost expression first, then work my way out.\n\nLet me try to number each level for clarity. There are nine sets of parentheses, so I'll number them from the innermost as Level 1 to the outermost as Level 9.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute that: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute that: 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute that: 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute that: 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, compute 29524 * 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the breakdown earlier, I thought 3*29524 would be 88572. Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a moment, but I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me double-check how many levels there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right?\n\nLooking back:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after each 1+3, I see that there are nine 1+3 expressions. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth level, but in my earlier calculation, I numbered them from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent level adds another 1+3(...). So, yes, nine levels in total.\n\nSo, my calculation from Level 1 to Level 9 seems correct, leading to the result inside the outermost parentheses being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the levels. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each time, it's 1+3*(next level). So, the innermost is Level 1: 1+3=4\n\nThen Level 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it another way, maybe using a different approach or looking for a pattern.\n\nWait, each level seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1+3=4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression, which might help verify the result.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nThus,\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used two different methods (iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation), and both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by simplifying it step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level of the expression follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By iteratively computing each level and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested series of operations of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (...)\\), with nine levels in total.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost level:**\n   - **Level 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Level 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Level 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Level 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Level 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Level 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Level 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Level 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Level 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the final result by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

It seems like each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by that. \n\nLet me write it down step by step to visualize better. Maybe if I start from the inside and work my way out, it'll be easier.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, so 40. Let me keep going.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 121. That's a nice number. I wonder if there's a pattern here. Let me see:\n\nWait, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next result. So, it's like a recursive process. Let me try to see if I can represent this as a sequence.\n\nLet me denote each step as a term in a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo, each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see how many layers there are here. Looking back at the original problem, I count 9 sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers do I need to compute?\n\nWait, let me count. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with 9 layers of 3*(...). Wait, no, let's see. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of multiplications by 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds a 3*(...). So, how many times do we have 3*(...) before we reach the outermost 3*? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside is 1+3(...), which is 1+3*(...). Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 3*(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, but that seems like 9 layers. But when I count the number of 3*(...) in the original expression, it's 9 layers, right? Because each 1+3(...) is a layer, starting from 1+3 as the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each time I go out, it's layer 2, 3, etc., up to layer 9. So, I think I need to compute up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, I then multiply by 3. So, let me make sure.\n\nWait, let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nFirst, innermost: 1+3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but that's 9 layers, right? Because I started with 1+3 as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so up to layer 9, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(result from layer 9). So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, I then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), and so on, with 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), up to 9 layers. So, I think I need to compute up to 9 layers, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I counted the layers earlier, I started with 1+3 as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so layer 9 would be the 9th such operation. So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...):\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the 9th layer. So, I think 9 layers in total, meaning I need to compute up to layer 9, which is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, the first layer inside is 1 + 3*(...). Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 8 more 1+3(...) terms. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside is 1 + 3*(...). Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think of it as 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, I think I have 9 layers, each time adding a new 1 + 3*(...). So, I think I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm by computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after layer 9, I have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of times I have 1 + 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the first layer is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is layer 2, and so on, up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of 3*(...) terms in the original expression, it's 9 layers. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is the first layer, then each time we have another 1 + 3*(...), so up to 9 layers. So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recount the layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost inside the 3* is layer 9. Then, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524. Let's do it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n20 * 3 = 60 + 1 = 61 \u2192 write down 1, carryover 6\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 + 6 = 1506 \u2192 write down 6, carryover 150\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 + 150 = 27150 \u2192 write down 0, carryover 271\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000 + 271 = 60271\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be:\n\nLet me compute it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 (ten-thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier step where I thought 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo,\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought of 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. But actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1, which is correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so the innermost is 4, and each layer up to 29524 is correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I've double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out, computing each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Next layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Each level seems to have a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, starting from the innermost part, I can probably work my way outwards. That makes sense because each parenthesis depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. The innermost part is 1+3, right? So let's compute that first.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the innermost expression is 1+3, and then that's multiplied by 3, and then added to 1, and so on. So maybe I should approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me try to count how many layers there are. Each time, there's a 1+3(...), and then that's multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, I see that there are nine sets of parentheses. So maybe this expression has nine layers? Hmm, that seems a bit tedious, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize, maybe a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, another approach: since each layer is 3 times (1 plus 3 times the next layer), maybe I can represent each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is computed based on the previous one.\n\nLet me try that. Let me define a sequence where a\u2081 is the innermost expression, and then each subsequent term builds upon that. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3. Let's compute that first.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is 1+3, but it's inside another 1+3(...). Hmm, maybe I need to define the layers more carefully.\n\nLet me try to index the layers. Let's say that the innermost expression is layer 1, which is 1+3. Then layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, which would be the outermost expression. But wait, in the given problem, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Hmm, actually, let me check.\n\nWait, the problem starts with 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So the innermost expression is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So maybe the number of layers is actually 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: \n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3* is layer 1.\n2. Inside that, the next \"(\" is layer 2.\n3. Then another \"(\" is layer 3.\n4. And so on until the ninth \"(\".\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", that's layer 1, then each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. After 3, the first \"(\" is layer 1.\n2. Then inside that, another \"(\" is layer 2.\n3. Continuing, up to layer 9, which is the innermost \"1+3\".\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"(\", I see that after the initial 3, there are 9 \"(\", so that would imply 9 layers, each with their own 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 9, then layer 8 is 1 + 3*(layer 9), and so on up to layer 1, which is the first \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but the problem is 3*(layer 1). So, the total expression is 3*(layer 1). Hmm, perhaps I should index it differently. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost as layer 1 and work outwards.\n\nWait, let's try that. Let me define layer 1 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on up to layer 9, which would be the outermost layer before the initial 3. Then the entire expression would be 3*(layer 9). That makes sense.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part (layer 1) and compute each subsequent layer up to layer 9. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{(Layer 9)}\\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I remember that when dealing with parentheses, you start solving the innermost one first and then work your way outward. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression so I can visualize it better. The innermost part is the last one: 1+3. So, let's start there.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3\n   - That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is: 1 + 3*(result from above). Let's compute that.\n\n2. Compute the next level: 1 + 3*(4)\n   - First, calculate 3*4: 3*4 = 12\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that part simplifies to 13. Now, moving one level out again, the next expression is: 1 + 3*(result from above).\n\n3. Compute the next level: 1 + 3*(13)\n   - First, 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to 40. Let's keep going outward.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40)\n   - 3*40 = 120\n   - 1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, now we have 121. Continuing outward.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121)\n   - 3*121 = 363\n   - 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm taking the result from the innermost parentheses, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. So, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me double-check my calculations so far.\n\nWait, let me list out each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo far, so good. Let me continue.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364\n   - 3*364: Let's compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092\n   - 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093\n   - 3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279\n   - 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280\n   - 3*3280: Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840\n   - 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841\n   - 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; so 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523\n   - 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 9841*3 seems a bit high. Let me compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nNow, adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving outward again, the next level is:\n\n10. Next level: 1 + 3*29524\n    - 3*29524: Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72\n    - Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n      - 20000*3=60000\n      - 9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n      - 500*3=1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n      - 24*3=72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n    - So, 3*29524 = 88572\n    - Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because 29524*3 seems a bit tricky. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we have 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nSo, that step is correct.\n\nNow, moving outward again, the next level is:\n\n11. Next level: 1 + 3*88573\n    - Let's compute 3*88573\n    - 80000*3=240000\n    - 8000*3=24000 \u2192 240000 + 24000 = 264000\n    - 500*3=1500 \u2192 264000 + 1500 = 265500\n    - 70*3=210 \u2192 265500 + 210 = 265710\n    - 3*3=9 \u2192 265710 + 9 = 265719\n    - Wait, that can't be right because 88573 \u00d7 3 should be calculated correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in breaking it down.

Let me write it down:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 \u2192 write 9\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21 \u2192 write 1, carry 2\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carry 2\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 write 6, carry 2\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write the carry over 2 as the next digit.\n\nSo, the result is 265719.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n\n80,000 \u00d7 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 \u00d7 3 = 24,000 \u2192 total so far: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n70 \u00d7 3 = 210 \u2192 265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 \u2192 265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 88573 \u00d7 3 = 265,719.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 265,719 + 1 = 265,720.\n\nWait, no, wait: 1 + 3*(88573) = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, 3*88573 is 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives 265,720.\n\nSo, that's the next level: 265,720.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next level is:\n\n12.

It seems like each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So it's like a chain of these expressions. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write it down step by step. Let's see, starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Then that's multiplied by 3, and then added to 1, and so on. So maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say the innermost is layer 1, then moving outward, it's layer 2, and so on until layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), so let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me count the number of 3s or the number of layers. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next layer: 3*(1+3)\n3. Then: 1 + result\n4. Then multiplied by 3 again, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the inside out, computing each innermost expression first.\n\nLet me start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me count how many times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + layer1): 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15, which is layer2.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + layer2): 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, layer3.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147, layer4.\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444, layer5.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335, layer6.\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008, layer7.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027, layer8.\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084, layer9.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Because the original expression has 9 sets of 3*(1+...), so maybe I have 9 layers. Let me make sure I counted correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (layer1)\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (layer2)\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (layer3)\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (layer4)\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (layer5)\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (layer6)\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 (layer7)\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 (layer8)\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 (layer9)\n\nSo the outermost layer is layer9, which is 36084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step, I'm adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me check a couple of steps again.\n\nFor example, layer5: previous result was 147, so 1 + 147 = 148, then 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 444 = 445, 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 1335 = 1336, 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 4008 = 4009, 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 12027 = 12028, 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWe can write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nA = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, n=9, because we have 9 layers.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*6561: Let's compute 10*6561 = 65610, plus 1*6561 = 6561, so total is 65610 + 6561 = 72171\n\nThen, subtract 3: 72171 - 3 = 72168\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084\n\nSo, that matches our previous step-by-step computation. Therefore, the result is indeed 36084.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the recursive formula and solve it, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 36084 is the correct result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the final result is 36084.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{36084}"

Each layer seems to be 3 times something, and that something is (1 + another expression). So, it's like a chain of 3s and 1s with a lot of nesting. \n\nHmm, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me see how many layers there are. Starting from the end, I can count each opening parenthesis until I reach the innermost part.\n\nLet me count: There's an opening parenthesis before the last 1+3, then another before that, and so on. Let me see, each time I see a \"1+3\" inside another set of parentheses. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the left: 3(1+3(...)). Each time I see a 3 followed by a (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to count the number of layers. Let me try to write it out step by step.\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me write this as layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). So, let me list them step by step.\n\n1. Innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3s: Each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(...)) and each time the inner part is another 3(...). So, how many 3s are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s before the first parenthesis:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3 inside, so that's 2\n3. Then another 3, so 3\n4. Then another 3, 4\n5. Then another 3, 5\n6. Another 3, 6\n7. Another 3, 7\n8. Another 3, 8\n9. The last one is the innermost 3 in (1+3).\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 3s, each time nesting deeper. So, that would mean 9 layers, starting from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had Layer 1 as innermost, up to Layer 9 as the outermost. So, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so that would be Layer 9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 36084, but let me check each step again because I might have made a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step, carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028\n\nNow, let's compute 3*12028.\n\nFirst, 12028 * 3:\n\nCompute 12,028 * 3:\n\n12,000 * 3 = 36,000\n\n28 * 3 = 84\n\nSo, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" parts.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time there's a (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another (1+3(...\n3. So, each time, it's a new layer.\n\nHow many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLooking at the string: \"3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is followed by another parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times we have a 3 followed by a (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...), and the innermost is (1+3). So, 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I got 36,084, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the value is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nEach a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a recurrence relation.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it as follows.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: C = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolve for C: C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = 11/(2*3) = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6\n\nSimilarly, 3/2 = (9)/6, so:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (11*9 -9)/6 = (99 -9)/6 = 90/6=15, which matches.\n\nn=3: (11*27 -9)/6 = (297 -9)/6=288/6=48, which is correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work.\n\nNow, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^9 -9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 -9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 *10=196,830\n\n19683 *1=19,683\n\nTotal: 196,830 +19,683=216,513\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216,513 -9=216,504\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 /6=36,084\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the value is indeed 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula.\n\nWait, the formula was derived correctly, right? a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, which simplifies to (11*3^n -9)/6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each step adding another layer, so each time, the value is 3*(1 + previous value). So, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, but the formula seems solid, and it checks out with the step-by-step calculation.\n\nSo, I think I can be confident that the answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I counted the layers correctly.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, each time it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s before the first parenthesis:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3 inside: that's the second layer.\n3. Then another 3: third layer.\n4. Continue until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of times I see a \"3(\".\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a (1+3(...)), which introduces another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" in the string.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then another 3( inside that: 3(1+3(\n3. Another: 3(1+3(\n4. Another: 3(1+3(\n5. Another: 3(1+3(\n6. Another: 3(1+3(\n7. Another: 3(1+3(\n8. Another: 3(1+3(\n9. Another: 3(1+3)\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1+3), so that's the 9th layer.\n\nSo, total layers: 9.\n\nSo, n=9, which gives a_9=36,084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula:\n\na_n = (11*3^n -9)/6\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 -9)/6 = (11*19683 -9)/6 = (216,513 -9)/6 = 216,504/6=36,084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it iteratively, step by step, to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach, like expanding the expression.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps it's more efficient to stick with the step-by-step approach and the formula.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 36,084.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using another method, like working from the inside out.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step again, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1 +3) =4\n\n2. Then, moving out one layer: 3*(1 +4)=3*5=15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 +15)=3*16=48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 +48)=3*49=147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 +147)=3*148=444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027\n\n9. Finally: 3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to keep track:\n\n| Layer | Value         |\n|-------|---------------|\n| 1     | 4             |\n| 2     | 15            |\n| 3     | 48            |\n| 4     | 147           |\n| 5     | 444           |\n| 6     | 1335          |\n| 7     | 4008          |\n| 8     | 12027         |\n| 9     | 36084         |\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the formula with n=1,2,3, etc., to ensure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: (11*3^1 -9)/6 = (33-9)/6=24/6=4.

It seems like each part inside the parentheses is similar, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, let me start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last one: (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, that was simple enough. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). Let me write that down step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4\n3. Then, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we go all the way out to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine of them. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, there are nine layers in total, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. \n\nWait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9, and moving outward to layer 1, which is the outermost.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2)\n\nWait, actually, the outermost layer is 3 times (Layer 2). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer), except the outermost layer which is 3 times the inner layer.\n\nSo, let's start computing from the innermost layer and move outward.\n\nLet me define each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3 times 9841.\n\nFirst, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 800 = 2400\n\n3 * 40 = 120\n\n3 * 1 = 3\n\nNow, add them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 9841 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n\n1 * 3 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nSo, writing it down: 4, then 4, then 6, then 7. Wait, that can't be right because when you write the digits from right to left, it should be 4, 4, 6, 7, but wait, no, actually, let's do it properly.\n\nWait, 9841\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write down the 2.\n\nWait, that would be 29523.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841=29523. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 29523.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be represented recursively. Maybe there's a formula I can use to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually.\n\nWait, let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which would be the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_2), where a_2 is the second layer from the inside. Wait, no, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the layers from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, which would be the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), so each layer after the first is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost layer is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but wait, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 8), not 3*(layer 9). Because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, but the final expression is 3*(layer 8). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indexing.\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, no, because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is layer 1, and each time we go out, we add another layer, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9).\n\nWait, but that would make the outermost expression 3*(1 + 3*(layer 8)), which would be 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier result. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me try to structure this properly.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) =4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)=13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*(Layer 2)=40\n\nLayer 4:1 + 3*(Layer 3)=121\n\nLayer 5:1 + 3*(Layer 4)=364\n\nLayer 6:1 + 3*(Layer 5)=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 + 3*(Layer 6)=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 + 3*(Layer 7)=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 + 3*(Layer 8)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the final result was 29523, but that was when I considered Layer 8 as the outermost. So, perhaps I made a mistake in how I counted the layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me count them:\n\nStarting after the initial 3, each \"(\" starts a new layer:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers. Each layer is \"1 + 3*(next layer)\", except the outermost, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, the structure is:\n\n3*(layer 1), where layer 1 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, until layer 9, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, that can't be because the innermost is layer 9: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, layer 9: 1 + 3 =4\n\nlayer 8:1 + 3*4=13\n\nlayer 7:1 + 3*13=40\n\nlayer 6:1 + 3*40=121\n\nlayer 5:1 + 3*121=364\n\nlayer 4:1 + 3*364=1093\n\nlayer 3:1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nlayer 2:1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nlayer 1:1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 1)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that's different from my initial calculation where I thought the final result was 29523. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to visualize the structure again.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 9.\n\nThen, each layer up to layer 1 is 1 + 3*(next layer).\n\nSo, layer 9: 1 + 3=4\n\nlayer 8:1 + 3*4=13\n\nlayer 7:1 + 3*13=40\n\nlayer 6:1 + 3*40=121\n\nlayer 5:1 + 3*121=364\n\nlayer 4:1 + 3*364=1093\n\nlayer 3:1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nlayer 2:1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nlayer 1:1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 1)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the outermost expression was 3*(layer 2)=29523, but that seems to be incorrect because there are nine layers, so the outermost layer is layer 1, which is 1 + 3*(layer 2)=29524, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, that would make the final answer 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was 29523, but now I'm getting 88572. I must have miscounted the layers before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me write out the entire expression step by step, expanding each layer one by one.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) =4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)=1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*(Layer 2)=1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 + 3*(Layer 3)=1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 + 3*(Layer 4)=1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 + 3*(Layer 5)=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 + 3*(Layer 6)=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 + 3*(Layer 7)=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 + 3*(Layer 8)=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4, and building up to layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 29523, which was when I stopped at layer 8, which was 9841, and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. But that was incorrect because I didn't account for all the layers.\n\nWait, let me check the number of layers again. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so the total number of layers is 9, meaning the outermost layer is layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(layer 8).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9)=3*(1 + 3*(layer 8))=3*(1 + 3*9841)=3*(1 + 29523)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was stopping at layer 8 and not going all the way to layer 9, then multiplying by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute it again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThen, the sequence would be:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 + 3*4=13\n\na3=1 + 3*13=40\n\na4=1 + 3*40=121\n\na5=1 + 3*121=364\n\na6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\na7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, but now I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by computing the layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier computation. So, using the formula, we also get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by stopping at layer 8 and not going all the way to layer 9, which is why I got 29523 instead of 88572. It's important to ensure that I account for all layers, especially when dealing with nested expressions.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation formula, I've arrived at the conclusion that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), except the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3. By computing each layer step by step, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression), starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n3. **Compute each subsequent layer**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**:  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of 3s multiplied by terms that involve 1 plus another similar expression. It seems repetitive, so maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit without having to compute each layer manually. But since it's only nine layers deep, maybe I can compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Let's denote the innermost part as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet\u2019s define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3*(...). So maybe the layers are from inside out, with each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. And so on, up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but the problem has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3. Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(...), so the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSo, let's define each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nI can compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series or find a formula for it, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for layer 9, a_9 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = (3*59049 -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and multiply the final layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

It seems like there are multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times something, and each time it's wrapped inside another set of parentheses. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, let's identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, I see that the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, so after computing (1+3) as 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, next layer: 1 + 3*4. Let's compute the multiplication first: 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now that layer simplifies to 13. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*13. Multiplication first: 3*13 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo now that layer is 40. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let's calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*40. Multiplication: 3*40 = 120. Then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nAlright, that's 121. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute this.\n\n1 + 3*121. Multiplication: 3*121. Hmm, 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo now we have 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo that layer is 1093. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute this.\n\n1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nHmm, that's 3280. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute this.\n\n1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 29524. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute this.\n\n1 + 3*29524. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then add 1: 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nSo now that layer is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n3*88573. Let me break it down: 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe another way: 88573 * 3. \n\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, carryover 2\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26.\n\nWait, but hold on, 88573 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out:\n\n88573\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2\nBut wait, there's no more digits, so carryover 2 would be added as 200000?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me try again.\n\nWait, 88573 is 8 (ten thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 3 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n3*3 = 9\n\nTens place:\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\nHundreds place:\n3*5 = 15 + 2 (carryover) = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\nThousands place:\n3*8 = 24 + 1 (carryover) = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\nTen thousands place:\n3*8 = 24 + 2 (carryover) = 26, write down 6, carryover 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 becomes 200000. So putting it all together, we have 265719. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 265719 is 265,719, but when I do it step by step, the digits are 9,1,7,5,6, and then 2 carried over as 200000. So actually, the total would be 265,719.\n\nWait, but when I did the initial calculation by breaking it into parts, I got 265,719 as well. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 3*80000 + 3*8000 + 3*500 + 3*70 + 3*3, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me check that again.\n\n3*80000 = 240,000\n3*8000 = 24,000\n3*500 = 1,500\n3*70 = 210\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*88,573 = 265,719.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step was:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n10. 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573\n11. 3*88,573 = 265,719\n\nSo, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait a minute, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to slip up with so many layers.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Then 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n7. 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,000=3,000, 3*93=279. So 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n8. 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,000=9,000, 3*280=840. 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n9. 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*41=123. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 123 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n10. 1 + 3*29,524. 3*29,000=87,000, 3*524=1,572. So 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Then 1 + 88,572 = 88,573. Correct.\n11. Finally, 3*88,573. As computed earlier, that's 265,719. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. So the final answer is 265,719.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

Next layer:\n    \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\]\n\n11. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 88573 = 265719 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of expressions. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so now I can replace the innermost (1+3) with 4. Let me rewrite the expression with that substitution. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(something). Let me see:\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(the result of the innermost parentheses). So after replacing (1+3) with 4, the next expression becomes:\n\n1 + 3*(4)\n\nLet me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So now, that middle part becomes 13. Let me update the expression.\n\nSo now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(something). Let me see, after the first substitution, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many layers there are. Let me see. Each time, there's a 1 + 3*(...), and each time, I can compute the innermost one first.\n\nWait, maybe I should number each step to keep track. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a step, starting from the innermost.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of layers. Let me count how many times I have 1 + 3*(...). Let me look at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 1+3 terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), so I think I need to compute 9 layers, each time substituting the innermost expression.\n\nWait, maybe I should write each step clearly. Let me try that.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, I can compute from the innermost parentheses outward. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 2: So the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 3: Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364: Let me check that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; so 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 9: Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n3*29524: Let me compute that. 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572; so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNow, after computing all 9 layers, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 88573. So now, the final step is to compute 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*88573.\n\nI can break it down:\n\n3*80000 = 240000\n\n3*8000 = 24000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4=13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13=40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40=121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121=364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nWait, hold on, in my earlier steps, I think I went up to 88573, but now I'm seeing that after 9 steps, it's 29524. Wait, maybe I miscounted the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount how many times I have 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, from the first 3, the first (1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count how many times (1+3 appears:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3)\n3. (1+3)\n4. (1+3)\n5. (1+3)\n6. (1+3)\n7. (1+3)\n8. (1+3)\n9. (1+3)\n10. (1+3)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 10 instances of (1+3(...)). That means I have to compute 10 layers, not 9 as I initially thought.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. I thought there were 9 layers, but actually, there are 10. So, my earlier steps only went up to 9 layers, but I think I need to go one more step.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. Let me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time, I have to compute (1 + 3), then move outwards. So, let's recount:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, that's 10 steps. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 88573. So, the final step is 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that again to be sure.\n\n3 * 88573:\n\nCompute 88573 * 3:\n\n3*80000 = 240000\n\n3*8000 = 24000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding up:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought I had 10 layers, so the innermost expression after 10 steps is 88573, and then 3 times that is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted the layers correctly.\n\nLooking at the original expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first ( is the start of the first layer, then each subsequent ( is a new layer.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n2. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n8. (1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n9. (1+3))))))))) )\n10. (1+3))))))))) )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one. Let me instead count how many times the pattern (1+3(...) appears.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. So, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 10.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I only went up to 9 steps, but now I'm seeing that it's 10 layers. So, perhaps my initial count was wrong, and the correct number of layers is 10, leading to the final result of 265,719.\n\nWait, let me confirm this with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=13\n\nNext layer: 1+3*13=40\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40=120\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nOutermost: 3*40=120\n\nSo, that's 3 layers inside, and the outermost 3*(...) makes it 4 layers in total. Wait, but in the problem, each layer is 1+3*(...), so perhaps each layer after the first 3 is a new layer. So, in this small example, we have 3 layers after the initial 3, making 4 layers total.\n\nWait, but in the problem, perhaps the number of layers is 9, not 10, because the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3)\n3. (1+3)\n4. (1+3)\n5. (1+3)\n6. (1+3)\n7. (1+3)\n8. (1+3)\n9. (1+3)\n10. (1+3)\n\nWait, so 10 instances of (1+3(...)), meaning 10 layers. So, each time, I compute 1 + 3*(previous result), 10 times, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the small example, we had 3 layers inside the initial 3, leading to 3*(...), which had 3 layers inside. So, perhaps in the problem, the number of layers is 9, not 10, because the innermost is (1+3), then 8 more layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me try again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count how many times (1+3 appears, each time starting a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3)\n3. (1+3)\n4. (1+3)\n5. (1+3)\n6. (1+3)\n7. (1+3)\n8. (1+3)\n9. (1+3)\n10. (1+3)\n\nWait, that's 10 times. So, 10 layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, so in the small example, 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))) has 3 layers inside, so 3*(...), making 4 layers total. So, perhaps in the problem, there are 10 layers inside, so 10 steps, leading to the result 88573, and then 3*88573=265,719.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 steps, leading to 88573, then 3*88573=265,719.\n\nWait, but when I first started, I thought there were 9 layers, but after recounting, I think it's 10 layers. So, perhaps the correct answer is 265,719.\n\nWait, let me check the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nEach ( after the initial 3 starts a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n2. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n8. (1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n9. (1+3))))))))) )\n10. (1+3))))))))) )\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Each time, the number of opening parentheses decreases by one, but that's perhaps because I'm miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps each (1+3(...) is a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1+3 appears, which is 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 1+3=4, then each subsequent step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, for n layers, the result after n steps is 1 + 3*(result after n-1 steps).\n\nSo, in the problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nSo, that's 10 layers, meaning 10 steps. So, the result inside the outermost 3*(...) is 88573, and then 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, so I think I was correct with 10 layers, leading to 265,719 as the final result.\n\nLet me just confirm this by computing each step again:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nSo, after 10 steps, the value is 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*88573.\n\nCalculating 3*88573:\n\n3*80000 = 240000\n\n3*8000 = 24000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I thought I had 9 layers, but after recounting, it's 10 layers, so the final answer is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each step seems to be following a geometric progression or some kind of recursive formula.\n\nLet me think about it. If I denote a_n as the value after n layers, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1, a1=4\n\nn=2, a2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nn=3, a3=1 + 3*13=40\n\nn=4, a4=1 + 3*40=121\n\nAnd so on, up to n=10, a10=88573.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=10, a10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nThus, a10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can confirm that the value after 10 layers is 88573, and the final result is 265,719.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

It seems like there's a pattern here where each layer is 3 times something, and that something is 1 plus 3 times another expression. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). Then that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). Let me try to compute it layer by layer, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. So, layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(layer1) + 1, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute each step one by one. Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on, actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the structure. Let me write the entire expression with each layer labeled.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So starting from E1 and building up to E9, then multiplying the final result by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, let's compute each E step by step.\n\nCompute E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me go through each computation again:\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check E9 again. E8 was 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression had 9 layers of (1+3(...)) before the outermost 3. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the innermost, then each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3( occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3). Then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3( occur? Let's count.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3(, there are 8 more 1 + 3( inside. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of layers. Each layer is a 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of closing parentheses. The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds a closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after each opening.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost (1 + 3). So, that would make 9 layers in total, right?\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3, then inside it is 1 + 3*(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the outermost 3, then 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer, then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost. So, counting the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, we have:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nThen, the innermost is (1 + 3). So, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), right? So, that would mean E9 is the innermost, and then each layer builds on that. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I had E1 as the innermost, and E9 as the outermost. So, perhaps I should adjust that.\n\nWait, no, actually, in my earlier approach, E1 was the innermost, and E9 was the outermost, so that would mean that the entire expression is 3*E9, which is correct because the outermost is 3*(E9). So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the initial 3(...). Each time there's a \"1 + 3(\", that's an opening parenthesis, and then it's closed later.\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3(, then inside that, we have:\n\n1 + 3( ... )\n\nSo, the first layer is 1 + 3*(...), which is E1 in my earlier notation. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is E2, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3), which is E9.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if I have 9 layers, then the innermost would be E9, but when I computed E9 earlier, it was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there's a 1 + 3(, then inside that, another 1 + 3(, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. After the initial 3(, we have 1 + 3(\n2. Inside that, another 1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3(, the next is 1 + 3(, then inside that, another 1 + 3(, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3(.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is an opening parenthesis, so let's count:\n\n1. After 3(, we have 1 + 3(\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(\n3. Continuing this way, until the innermost.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost (1 + 3). So, that's 8 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, that would make 9 layers in total, right?\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because the initial 3(...) is layer 1, and then each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, making 8 more layers, totaling 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had E1 as the innermost, which would be the 9th layer, and then E9 would be the outermost. But that seems contradictory because if the innermost is E1, then each layer above would be E2, E3, etc., up to E9 as the outermost. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, with E9 being the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but let me try to visualize this. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(E9)\n\nLayer 2: E9 = 1 + 3*(E8)\n\nLayer 3: E8 = 1 + 3*(E7)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: E1 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, that would mean that E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost. So, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I computed E1 through E9, starting from the innermost, and then multiplied by 3, which gave me 88572. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me compute E1 to E9 again step by step, just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form E_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, E1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nE4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nE5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nE6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nE7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nE8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nE9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let's see. It's a nested expression with a bunch of 3s and 1s. Each part seems to be of the form 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see the structure better. Starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, 1 + 3 = 4. Got that. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me note that.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n4. And this continues until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until we have 9 layers, I think. Wait, let me count the number of 3s multiplied by the parentheses.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time, it's 1 + 3*(layer n). So, let's count the number of times 1+3 is present.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(layer 1)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. Then, (1 + 3*(layer 2)) \u2192 layer 3\n4. And so on, until layer 9, because each time we have a new (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of these:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), and each layer is one more than the previous. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(layer 1)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. (1 + 3*(layer 2)) \u2192 layer 3\n4. (1 + 3*(layer 3)) \u2192 layer 4\n5. (1 + 3*(layer 4)) \u2192 layer 5\n6. (1 + 3*(layer 5)) \u2192 layer 6\n7. (1 + 3*(layer 6)) \u2192 layer 7\n8. (1 + 3*(layer 7)) \u2192 layer 8\n9. (1 + 3*(layer 8)) \u2192 layer 9\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer 9). So, total layers: 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, I need to compute layer 1 to layer 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840+1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since there are 9 layers. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n-1} - c/(1 - r).\n\nWait, let me check that formula. The standard linear recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, both by computing each layer manually and by using the recurrence relation formula to find a general expression, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost layer and work our way out.

It seems like a nested expression where each part is 1 plus 3 times something, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. Each time, the expression is wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 1+3 is nested inside. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to work from the inside out, solving each innermost expression first and then moving outward.\n\nSo, let's start with the innermost part: 1+3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. \n\nSo, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. \n\nSo, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving one more layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So that's 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my steps because 3*13 is indeed 39, and 39 + 1 is 40. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nMoving outward again, we have 1 + 3*(40). So, 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nHmm, 121. That's a familiar number, it's 11 squared. Interesting. Let me continue.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). So, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nWait, 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Yes, so 363 + 1 is 364.\n\nMoving outward again: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that. 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nAlright, so that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3*1093.\n\nWell, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me confirm: 1093 * 3. Let me compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, so 3279 + 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nMoving outward again, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nHmm, 9841. That's a big number. Let me just check my multiplication: 3280 * 3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Yes, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that. 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify: 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute that. 3*29524.\n\nHmm, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Correct.\n\nMoving outward again, we have 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute that. 3*88573.\n\nWell, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Let's add them up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.\n\nWait, let me verify that: 88573 * 3. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Correct.\n\nNow, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute that. 3*265720.\n\nCalculating 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Let's add them up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Correct.\n\nFinally, moving outward to the outermost layer, we have 3*(797161). Let's compute that. 3*797161.\n\nCalculating 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Let's add them up: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 797161 * 3. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost part and working outward, each step gives us a larger number, and finally, the entire expression evaluates to 2,391,483.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Let me go through the key steps again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. Finally, 3*797161 = 2,391,483\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nI think I did that correctly, but just to be thorough, let me check a couple of the intermediate steps again.\n\nFor example, step 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123, so 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 524*3=1572, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1572 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Correct.\n\nStep 11: 1 + 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 573*3=1719, so 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1719 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. Correct.\n\nStep 12: 1 + 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5720*3=17160, so 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 17160 is 797160, plus 1 is 797161. Correct.\n\nStep 13: 3*797161. Let me compute this again: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 = 2391000, plus 300 = 2391300, plus 180 = 2391480, plus 3 = 2391483. Correct.\n\nAlright, so after carefully stepping through each layer and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the final result is 2,391,483.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{2391483}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost part and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost part: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n10. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\\)\n11. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\\)\n12. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\\)\n13. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times 797161 = 2391483\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2391483}\n\\]"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me rewrite the expression to visualize it better. It's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that start with 1 plus something. Each time, the something is another 3 multiplied by a similar expression. So, it's like a chain of operations. Maybe if I count the number of layers, I can figure out how many steps I need to take.\n\nLooking at it, I can see that there are multiple layers of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost one is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1+3(...))\n3. I think there are nine layers in total because each time it's 1+3(...), and the number of opening parentheses increases each time.\n\nWait, let me check again. Starting from the inside:\n\n- The innermost part is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, the next layer is 1+3( that innermost part)\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3( the previous layer)\n- And this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, each time, I'm adding another layer of 1 + 3*(something). Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n10. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers inside the final multiplication by 3. So, I need to compute Layer 1 to Layer 9, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me write this down step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nFirst, 3*29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I did that wrong. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, write down the carry over if any. But in this case, we're done.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each layer builds upon the previous one correctly. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or use a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's similar to a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value at layer n.\n\nThen, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the known layers.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, it works for the first few layers. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute L_9 again using the formula:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, actually, when multiplying:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, writing it out: 8 (from the 2*3 + carryover), then 8 (from 9*3 + carryover), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carryover), and finally 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that doesn't align with the places.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and both the iterative approach and the closed-form formula give me the same result. So, unless I made a mistake in the formula itself, which I don't think I did because it worked for the initial layers, the answer should be correct.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

It seems like there are multiple layers of parentheses, each containing a similar structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works for nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So let me start there.\n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I messed that up. Let me try again. The innermost parentheses is the last (1+3). So starting from the inside:\n\nLet me label each layer to keep track. Let's say we have layers from 1 to 9, with layer 1 being the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(result from layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so layer 2 is 13.\n\nNow, layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to layer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute that: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute that: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(result from layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute that: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute that: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute that: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(result from layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute that: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(result from layer 9).

Each layer seems to have a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards should probably be the way to go. \n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, that's nine layers deep.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29,524 is:\n\nDigits: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nWait, hold on, 29,524 is actually 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake with so many layers.\n\nSo, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, each step, I compute the innermost first, then plug into the next layer, and so on.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, maybe using a geometric series or something.\n\nLooking at the structure: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, this formula approach confirms my step-by-step computation. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is similar to the formula for a geometric series, but with an additive constant. But since I already solved it using the recurrence, I think that's sufficient.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the result of 88,572. Then, using the recurrence relation approach, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with these kinds of nested expressions.\n\nSo, the expression is built up with multiple layers of 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to parse it. Starting from the very inside:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). \n\nWait, maybe I should write down each layer step by step to keep track.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out.

Hmm, but I should check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recalculate each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer checks out. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm the answer. Perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), then we can see that each term is defined recursively.\n\nLet me write out the recursion:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nThe recursion is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to compute it directly for n=9.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but since I was able to solve the recurrence relation and get the same result, I'm confident that 36084 is correct.\n\nJust to recap, I started by computing each nested layer step by step, making sure each calculation was correct. Then, I approached it using recurrence relations, found a closed-form formula, and used that to compute the 9th term, which gave me the same result. This double-checking makes me sure that the answer is accurate.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. Here are the key steps:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer and multiply by 3:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[ 3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\]\n   \\[ 3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\]\n\nTo verify, we recognize the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1}) \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence, we find the closed-form solution:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{11}{6} \\times 3^n - \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 9 \\):\n\n\\[ a_9 = \\frac{11}{6} \\times 19683 - \\frac{3}{2} = 36084 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parenthesis: \n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, let me check. Each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost (1+3) which is 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So maybe I should write it step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me clarify.\n\nThe structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then, each layer is 3*(1 + result of the next layer).\n\nWait, maybe I should number the layers from the inside out.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until E9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the original expression. It starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that 3*(...) is another 3*(...), etc., nine times.\n\nWait, actually, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))):\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nAfter 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses, each followed by 1+3(...). So, there are 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, then 8th, etc., up to the first layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the value of the current layer and substituting it into the next outer layer.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nNow, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's breaking it down, but perhaps it's easier to compute directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, especially with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make an arithmetic mistake. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such expressions. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution E_n^p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolve for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1=4.\n\nE_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, no. Wait, in our earlier breakdown, we had Layer 1 to Layer 9, where Layer 1 was the innermost. But in the recurrence, E_n corresponds to the nth layer from the innermost. So, if we have 9 layers, then E_9 would be the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), which is E1=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is E9, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, according to our formula, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nThus, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)). There are 9 layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   Each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each level seems to have a similar structure: 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. So the innermost part is:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThat's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so now, moving one level out, the next expression is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\nBut wait, I just computed that 1 + 3 is 4, so this becomes:\n\n1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo that simplifies to 13. Let me note that down.\n\nSo, the next level out is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nWhich we now know is 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13 first.\n\n3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, so that's 40. Moving out another level, we have:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 121. That's interesting, it's a perfect square. Maybe that's a pattern here.\n\nNext level out is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121.\n\n3*120 = 360, and 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, 364. Okay, moving out another level.\n\nNext expression:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364.\n\nLet me break that down. 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo, 1093. Hmm, that's a prime number, I think. Not sure if that matters, but just noting.\n\nNext level out is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093.\n\nLet me do 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSo, 3280. Okay, moving out another level.\n\nNext expression:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9841. Hmm, that number seems familiar. Wait, is that a square? Let me check. 99^2 is 9801, 100^2 is 10000. So, 9841 is between them. Let me see if it's a perfect square.\n\nLet me compute 99^2: 99*99 = 9801\n\n100^2 = 10000\n\nSo, 9841 is not a perfect square. Maybe it's a cube? 21^3 is 9261, 22^3 is 10648. So, no. Maybe it's a prime number? Not sure, but maybe I should just keep going.\n\nNext level out:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841.\n\nLet me do 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, 29524. Hmm, okay. Next level.\n\nNext expression:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524.\n\nLet's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72\n\nSo, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nSo, 88573. Hmm, that seems like a large number, but okay.\n\nNext level out is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*88573\n\nCompute 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n3*80000 = 240000\n\n3*8000 = 24000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*70 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nSo, adding those up:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nThen, 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nSo, 265720. Okay, moving out another level.\n\nNext expression:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me check.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, I computed each level step by step, and I think I did 9 levels. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n\n2. Next: 1+3*4=13\n\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40\n\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121\n\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364\n\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524\n\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=88573\n\n11. Next: 1+3*88573=265720\n\nWait, so that's 11 levels? Let me see.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(... 9 times ... )))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's 1 level, and each subsequent level adds another 3(...). So, how many levels do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(1+3... So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nUp to 9 times, I think. So, the outermost is 3 multiplied by the 9th level.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, each time, there's a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each next level adds another 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, we have 9 levels of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous.\n\nTherefore, starting from the innermost, we compute each level step by step, 9 times, and then multiply the outermost by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to 11 levels, but maybe I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3(1+3(...)), but how many 1+3(...) are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3(1+3), then the next is 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc.\n\nSo, the number of 1+3(...) is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent is 1+3(...), so how many?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each level out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3 are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc., until we have 9 levels.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3(1+3(...)), but let's count the number of 1+3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of 3s. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by a 1+ something. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if we have 9 levels of 1+3(...), then we need to compute 9 times.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 11 levels, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9\n\nSo, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nCompute L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nCompute L2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nCompute L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nCompute L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nCompute L5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nCompute L6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nCompute L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nCompute L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nCompute L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9, so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nCompute that.\n\nLet's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had gone up to 265720, which was after 11 levels, but now, with this structured approach, I only have 9 levels, resulting in 88572. So, I think I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), and each time, we have another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nUp to how many?\n\nLooking at the original expression, after the first 3(, there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n\n2. Then, 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing this way, how many 1+3 are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time, we have another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). So, the number of 1+3 expressions is equal to the number of times 1+3 is written. Let's count:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, so each time, we add another 1+3 inside. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each level out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3 are there? It seems like 9 levels, as the outermost is 3 multiplied by the 9th level.\n\nTherefore, my initial structured approach with L1 to L9 is correct, resulting in 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did it step by step without labeling, I ended up with 265720, which was after 11 levels. So, I think I must have miscounted the number of levels earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute 9 levels, resulting in 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then 1+3(, then another 1+3(, etc.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3(\n11. 1+3(\n12. 1+3)\n13. )))\n...\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the outermost:\n\n3( ... )\n\nInside the first parentheses, it's 1+3(...), and inside that, another 1+3(...), etc., until the innermost.\n\nSo, the number of 1+3(...) is equal to the number of times 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nThe original expression has 9 instances of 1+3(...). Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each level out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3 expressions are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, and each time we go out, we have another 1+3(...). So, the number of 1+3 expressions is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...), which is 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I write it out, it's:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is inside another 1+3(...). So, the number of 1+3 expressions is 9.\n\nTherefore, my initial structured approach with L1 to L9 is correct, resulting in 88572.\n\nTherefore, I think my earlier confusion was due to miscounting the levels, but now, with this clear structure, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nCompute L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nAdd them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think earlier, when I was doing it step by step without labeling, I mistakenly continued beyond 9 levels, which led to a higher number, but now, with this clear structure, I can confirm that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). Starting from the innermost, we compute each level step by step up to the 9th level and then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572  \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let's take it one step at a time.\n\nFirst, I'll try to identify the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the expression, I see multiple instances of (1+3(...)), so I guess each of these is a layer that I need to compute starting from the inside. Let me count how many layers there are. \n\nStarting from the inside, the first (1+3) is inside another (1+3(...)), and this repeats multiple times. Let me count them: each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's another layer. Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the problem, it's written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) so starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, because I see that there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me check that again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, let's count the number of (1 + 3) before the first closing parenthesis. Let me parse it:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving outward, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...))\n- Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied inside.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to write each step as I go from the inside out.\n\nLet me start by writing each layer step by step:\n\n1. Let's start with the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So Layer 1 = 4.\n\n2. Now, moving one layer out, we have: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)). So substituting Layer 1, that's (1 + 3*4). Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)). Substituting Layer 2, that's (1 + 3*13). Compute 3*13: 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a big jump. Let me verify:\n\nWait, 3*13 is indeed 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Okay, that's correct.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)). So that's (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)). So 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, after the innermost (1+3), there are 8 more layers, right? Because the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(... 8 times ...))). Wait, let me check the count again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times (1+3) appears. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)) until we reach the outermost expression. Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of times (1 + 3) appears before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to write down the layers as I go:\n\nLet me consider that each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, each step is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial count was correct with 9 layers, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524 would be the final result.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me list each layer with its calculation:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29,524 is written as 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, 29,524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones.\n\nSo, when we multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify each layer's calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive formula, but since the numbers are manageable, step-by-step computation seems feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that could be generalized. Let me see: each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, let me check if these terms fit into a geometric progression.\n\nCompute a_2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\na_3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\n\na_4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n\nIf I look at the homogeneous solution, the characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like a nested expression where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, it's like a chain of operations, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me write this out more clearly to visualize it better.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., I can maybe compute each one step by step.\n\nLet me start by identifying each layer:\n\n1. The innermost layer is L1 = 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving outward, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n3. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n4. Continuing this pattern, up to L9, since there are nine layers in total.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. Starting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is the start of layer 1.\n2. Then, inside that, another ( starts layer 2.\n3. Continuing, layer 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Each time, it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8)\n\nWait, no, actually, the structure is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 3*(1 + (1+3)), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3))), and so on. So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer starting from the innermost and working outward.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer1:\n\nLayer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3 = 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4 = 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5 = 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6 = 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7 = 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8 = 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9 = 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + Layer8), which would be Layer9. So, the final result should be Layer9, which is 36084.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2 = 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3 = 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4 = 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5 = 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6 = 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7 = 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8 = 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9 = 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each time, I'm taking the previous layer, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 15\n\nLayer3: 48\n\nLayer4: 147\n\nLayer5: 444\n\nLayer6: 1335\n\nLayer7: 4008\n\nLayer8: 12027\n\nLayer9: 36084\n\nHmm, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom Layer1 to Layer2: 4 to 15. 15 = 3*4 + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15. Yes.\n\nLayer2 to Layer3: 15 to 48. 48 = 3*15 + 3 = 45 + 3 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer3 to Layer4: 48 to 147. 147 = 3*48 + 3 = 144 + 3 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1) + 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 4 to halves: 8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nTherefore, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = 11*(3^n)/6 = 11*(3^{n-1})/2\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nAlternatively, factor 3:\n\n= (3*(11*3^{n-2} - 1))/2\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it as (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\nFirst, compute 10*6561 = 65,610\n\nThen, add 6561: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171\n\nSo, 11*6561 = 72,171\n\nNow, subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168\n\nThen, divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084\n\nWhich is the same as 36,084.\n\nSo, that confirms that the value of Layer9 is 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because when I derived the formula, I considered the recurrence starting at n=1, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 3, which is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3 and a constant term.\n\nSo, the sum can be represented as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWhich we solved as a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, and just computed each layer step by step, I also arrived at 36,084, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 36,084.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the previous layer). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Verification using a closed-form formula**:\n   - Recognize the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n   - Solve the recurrence to find a closed-form expression: a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n   - For n=9, compute a_9 = (11*3^8 - 3)/2 = 36084\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{36084}."

Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, let's rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It's 3 multiplied by a bunch of terms that are each 1 plus 3 times another similar term. So, starting from the innermost part, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace that innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). Wait, let me check.\n\nActually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list the layers from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from layer 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSince there are multiple layers, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result as I go outwards.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Looking at the original problem, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 3. Hmm, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and each time, the inner part is another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see how many times this nesting occurs.\n\nEach opening parenthesis adds a layer, so let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n- The first one is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- Then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...))\n- Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(...\n3. Then: (1 + 3*(...\n4. Then: (1 + 3*(...\n5. Then: (1 + 3*(...\n6. Then: (1 + 3*(...\n7. Then: (1 + 3*(...\n8. Then: (1 + 3*(...\n9. Then: (1 + 3*(...\n10. Finally, the innermost: (1 + 3)\n\nWait, so actually, starting from the first 3, there are 9 layers of nesting? Let me check that again. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of opening parentheses is 9. So, there are 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see:\n\n- After the first 3, there's 1 opening parenthesis, then another 3, which has another opening parenthesis, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, perhaps there are 9 layers in total, each layer being a 3*(1 + 3*(...)) structure.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers. Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...) terms.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by writing each step as I compute it. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 3*(1093) = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 3*(3280) = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 3*(9841) = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but let me check that. Each time, I compute the innermost parentheses, then move one layer out, compute the next, and so on. But maybe I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me try again more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent each layer with an index, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me try to structure this properly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let\u2019s define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n- Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n- a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n- And so on, up to a_9\n- Then, the final result is 3*a_9\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. So, starting with a_1, then building up to a_9, each time using the previous term.\n\nSo, let me compute each a_i step by step:\n\n1. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so let me compute that:\n\n3*29524: \n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with a_1:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364:\n\n364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it without calculating each step. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis kind of recurrence relation can sometimes be solved using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible here.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found by solving the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nThis method is much quicker and avoids computing each step manually. It's good to recognize the pattern and apply the recurrence relation formula.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each step manually and verify, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication steps again.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n- 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSame result, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is built from the previous one:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot a_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify how many layers there are. Starting from the inside, each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses. So, I think I'll need to compute this from the innermost one up to the ninth layer. Let me write each step down.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: 1+3. That's simple enough.\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the result from the innermost layer. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the second layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems right. Let me double-check: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yep, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems a bit big, but I think it's correct.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3 times 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That seems correct.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate that.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nNow, once I've computed the innermost part all the way out, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n10. Final computation: 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me do this step by step. 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\nThen, 3*500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3*20 = 60\n\nThen, 3*4 = 12\n\nAdding those up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 is actually 88572. Let me confirm using another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, carry over 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers because that seems like a big number, but I think each step built up correctly.\n\nLet me recap the layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because the first 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3 is another layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 9 layers, starting from 1+3, up to the 9th layer being 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me write down the expression again, but with labels for each layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, my earlier computation is correct, with 9 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that each step is correct because sometimes it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Now, multiplying by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute this again:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions that can be evaluated step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.
