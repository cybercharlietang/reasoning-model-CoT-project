    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part of the expression is similar, so maybe there's a pattern I can exploit.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the expression. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by a similar expression. So, it's like a recursive structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.\n\nLet me write it out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That might help me keep track of everything.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So 1 + 3*40. Let's compute: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer:\n\n5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4). That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n6. 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nNext layer:\n\n7. 1 + 3*(result from step 6). That's 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n8. 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nNext layer:\n\n9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n\n10. 3*(result from step 9). So 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29,000*3=87,000; 524*3=1,572; adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just noticed something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So after computing up to step 9, which gives 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me count how many layers there are to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Let's see, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3*(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach layer is a (1+3(...) part. Let me count the number of times (1+3 occurs:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3\n2. Then another (1+3\n3. Another (1+3\n4. Another (1+3\n5. Another (1+3\n6. Another (1+3\n7. Another (1+3\n8. Another (1+3\n9. The innermost (1+3\n\nSo that's 9 layers in total. So from step 1 to step 9, each step corresponds to each layer. Then, the final multiplication by 3 is step 10, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial steps, I had 10 steps, but the problem has 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) )\n\nSo starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3), each nested within the next. So the number of layers is 9, each time adding another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo when I computed up to step 9, that was the innermost part, and then step 10 was the outermost 3*(...). So perhaps the count is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. That's the 9th layer.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. That's the 8th layer.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. 7th layer.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121. 6th layer.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364. 5th layer.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 4th layer.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 3rd layer.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 2nd layer.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 1st layer.\n\n10. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That's the outermost multiplication.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step corresponds to one layer, starting from the innermost. So 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I thought there were 9 layers inside the outermost 3, so steps 1 through 9 compute each layer from innermost to outermost, and then step 10 is the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should approach it differently, using substitution.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in this problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I define f(k) as the value at the k-th layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute each layer step by step as I did before, since it's only 9 layers.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute each step again carefully, just to avoid any miscalculations.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), where f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume f_p(n) = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the value after n layers is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So if there are k layers, then f(k) = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost before the final multiplication is layer 9.\n\nSo f(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation at step 9.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as our final answer.\n\nSo that's another way to approach it, using the formula for the linear recurrence.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm the formula again because sometimes I might mix up the number of layers.\n\nIf f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, and we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, then f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, as we saw.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, then it's equivalent to 3*f(9), where f(9) is as above.\n\nSo, either way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. Next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. Outermost layer:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to parse it from the inside out because that usually works with these kinds of problems. So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. It seems like each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3 around that. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see: starting from the innermost, that's 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(previous), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Wait, actually, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1+3 term. Let me count them: 1+3, then another 1+3, and so on. It looks like there are nine 1+3 terms, each nested inside the next. So, that would be nine layers of 1+3, each multiplied by 3 and added to the next layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time we have a new 1 + 3 inside another set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(result of 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result of 2)\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a 3 followed by a (1 + 3(...)). Let me see how many times this happens. Let's count the number of 3s before a (1 + 3(...)). The first 3 is multiplied by the entire expression inside, then each subsequent 3 is inside the parentheses. So, perhaps there are nine layers here.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by starting from the innermost parenthesis and working my way out. Let me denote each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost, and S9 is the outermost.\n\nStarting with S1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen S2: 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen S3: 1 + 3*(S2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*(S3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*(S4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*(S5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*(S6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*(S7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*(S8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(S9). So, the final result would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step carefully because it's easy to make a mistake with the multiplications and additions.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(S9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet's compute 29524*3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step once more to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with S1: 4.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each step S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, starting from S1=4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. Let me see if I can find a formula for S_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nWe can find A and B such that S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nAssuming the solution is S_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, LHS = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSet equal to RHS: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition. When n=1, S1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, S_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have S9, let's compute that.\n\nS9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, S9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series with each term being multiplied by 3 each time, but I think the way I approached it step by step is sufficient.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step and the formula approach also confirms the result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each step as \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_9 \\), where each \\( S_i \\) is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times S_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( S_9 = 1 + 3 \\times S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times S_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

That's simple enough: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write that down.\n\nFirst layer:\n1 + 3(1 + 3) = 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. The problem has multiple layers, each time starting with 1 + 3 times the previous expression. So maybe I should handle each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\nNext layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\nNext: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many times this happens. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time I add a layer, so how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, there's another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are 9 opening parentheses, so that would mean 9 layers. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 + 3(...), so maybe there are 8 layers? Let me check:\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, so if I have n layers, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until layer 9, maybe? Because the original problem has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is (1+3(...)). Inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3)))\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning 9 layers? Hmm, but when I count the layers, starting from the innermost, maybe it's 8 layers because the innermost is just 1+3 without any further nesting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, starting from the innermost and working outward, calculating each layer one by one.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but that seems like 9 layers, but when I count the layers, each step is a layer, so starting from 1+3 as layer 1, then each subsequent step is another layer.\n\nWait, but the problem has 9 opening parentheses, so maybe there are 9 layers, meaning I need to compute 9 times? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count how many opening parentheses there are after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- After the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each \"(\", so 9 layers.\n\nBut when I computed up to 29524, that was 9 layers. Wait, but when I started, I thought the innermost was 1+3, which is layer 1, then each step adds another layer, so 9 layers would mean 9 computations.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I did 9 steps, starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(4), then 1+3*(13), etc., up to 9 layers, ending at 29524.\n\nBut then the entire expression is 3*(that result). Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing all the inner layers, we have the innermost as 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), until the outermost layer, which is 3*(...).\n\nWait, so perhaps I have 9 layers inside the 3*(...), meaning that after computing the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...), so 9 layers in total inside the first 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the result after 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Wait, but that can't be right because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, if there are 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))), so the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), up to 8 layers, because the first 3 is outside.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\nAnd so on, up to a_n.\n\nIn the original problem, how many terms do we have?\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, so that would imply n=9 terms, starting from a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the innermost expression is a_1 = 4, and the outermost is a_9 = 29524.\n\nBut then the entire expression is 3*(a_9), right? Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which equals 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I stopped at a_9 = 29524, but actually, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3(...). So, a_9 would be the innermost 1+3, and the outermost would be a_1, which is 3*(a_9). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me think again. The innermost is 1+3, which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524.\n\nBut then the entire expression is 3*a_9, because the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, and the outermost is a_9 without the extra 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recount the layers properly.\n\nLet me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (layer 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have 29524, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but that would mean the total number of layers is 9 inside the 3*(...), so the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this step by step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost 1+3, that's one layer.\n\nEach subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...), so up to the outermost, which is 3*(...).\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers inside the 3*(...), then yes, a_9 is 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has 8 layers inside the 3*(...), making a_8 the innermost, but that doesn't seem right because when I count the parentheses, it's 9.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is part of a new layer. So, from the first 3, the expression is (1+3(...)), which is the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on, until the innermost is (1+3), which is the ninth layer.\n\nSo, that would mean 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3*(...), so a_9 is 29524, and then 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again to make sure I'm not miscounting.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9, each corresponding to a new layer.\n\nTherefore, yes, 9 layers, so a_9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a similar expression with fewer layers, say:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nCompute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using my method:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, 3*a_2 = 39.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, another example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, entire expression: 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method, the original problem with 9 layers inside the 3*(...) would give 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8.

Next layer: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of expressions. So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the expression to make it a bit clearer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me see, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. There are nine sets of parentheses, so I think that means I'll need to compute this expression nine times, starting from the innermost one.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me check again. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So, maybe it's a recursive structure, but perhaps I can compute it step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse this. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, where E9 is the outermost one. So:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3 * E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3 * E2\n\n...\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 * E8\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3 * E9.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the outermost is 3*(E), where E is 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps E1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then E2 is 1 + 3*E1, and so on, up to E9, which would then be the expression inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(E), where E is 1 + 3*(another E). So, maybe I should think of each E as 1 + 3*E_previous.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me number the innermost parentheses as step 1, then each subsequent step will build on that.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the next step.\n\nWait, so perhaps it's a geometric progression or something. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's check again:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by this result, so 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, but let me check how many steps I did. Each step is a layer. Let me count: from the innermost, I did 9 steps, right? Because the original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, starting from there, each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, but when I did my steps, I went up to step 9, which was 1 + 3*9841, giving 29524, and then the outermost is 3*29524. But let me check how many layers I actually have.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. Starting from the first 3*(, each 1+3*( adds another layer.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a 1 + 3*(next layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3*( occur?\n\nLet me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then, each time, we have another 1 + 3*(...), so let's see how many times this occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers after the first one, because each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, maybe I have 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, let me try to parse it correctly. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*( appears, each time nesting another layer.\n\nLet me try to index the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. But let me check whether I did 9 layers or 8 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again, carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572, so total is 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 3*29524.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I did all the layers correctly. So, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me verify each step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; total 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the problem had nine layers, so I had to compute up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I actually had nine layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(, each layer adds a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times I see a 1 + 3*(:\n\n1. The first one is 1 + 3*(...\n2. Then another 1 + 3*(...\n3. Another 1 + 3*(...\n4. Another 1 + 3*(...\n5. Another 1 + 3*(...\n6. Another 1 + 3*(...\n7. Another 1 + 3*(...\n8. Another 1 + 3*(...\n9. The last one is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total. So, I think my calculation was correct, going up to Layer 9, giving me 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, E_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the outermost expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula works.\n\nFor example, if n=1, E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct.\n\nn=2: E_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches our step-by-step calculation.\n\nn=3: E_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems to be working correctly.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my calculations.\n\nWait, 3*29524: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n________\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( E_n \\) where \\( E_1 \\) is the innermost expression.

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of expressions. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1+3, right? Let me write that down:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, let me check the structure again.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving outwards, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, maybe I can represent each layer as a step where I compute 1 + 3*(previous value).\n\nLet me try to list each layer step by step. I'll number them from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9, I think. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(result from 1)\n3. 1 + 3*(result from 2)\n...\nUp to 9 layers because I see 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 parts. Starting from the first (1+3), then each subsequent one. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then one layer out is (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. From the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more (1+3(...)) parts. So, that would be 9 layers in total. Let me confirm:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nSo, I need to compute each layer step by step from 1 to 9, then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1+3. So, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*previous. So, from layer 1 to layer 9, each time we compute 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, after computing up to layer 9, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a layer, starting from the innermost. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each subsequent (1+3(...)) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time we have (1+3(...)), so let's count the number of these:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), meaning layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost before the final 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went up to layer 9 as 29524, which would then be multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, because the initial 3 is multiplying the entire expression, which is (1 + 3*(...)). So, the expression inside the first 3 is layer 9, which is 29524. Therefore, the total would be 3 * 29524.\n\nBut let me confirm each step because these numbers get big quickly, and I might have made a calculation error.\n\nLet me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because when I multiply 29524 by 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer once more because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of times (1+3) appears in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. Let me count the number of (1+3) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first (1+3) is layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3) is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) instances:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each (1+3( ... )) adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 layers. Therefore, layer 9 is the outermost one, which we computed as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive formula, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n = 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part is similar, just repeated multiple times. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI notice that each time, the structure is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, maybe I can compute each inner part first and then substitute back into the outer expressions.\n\nLet me start from the very inside. The innermost part is:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, I can replace that part with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\nBut wait, I just computed the inner part as 4, so this becomes:\n\n1 + 3(4)\n\nNow, 3 multiplied by 4 is 12, so this simplifies to:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that middle part simplifies to 13. Let me replace that in the next level up. The next expression is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nBut wait, I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me try to structure this better. Maybe I should number each step so I don't get confused.\n\nLet me define each level starting from the innermost. Let's say:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 10: 3(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check how many levels there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's the first level. Each time we add a layer, we go up a level. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is wrapped in another 3(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nLet me count how many times 3(1 + ... occurs. Let's see:\n\nEach time I go one layer out, I have another 3(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have 3 followed by a (1 + 3(...)). So, how many 3s are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3s before the innermost 1 + 3 is 9. Because starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 3. So, from the innermost 1 + 3, we have 9 layers of 3(1 + ...).\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 3*(...). So, let me think of it as a recursive expression.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built by the previous term. Let me define a_n as the value at the nth level.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing a_10, which is the innermost part, we have to multiply by 3. Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so after computing all the a_n up to a_9, we have to compute a_10 = 3*a_9, not 1 + 3*a_9.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted the levels. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the first layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the ninth layer, which is 88573, we have to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nEach time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), and so on.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so after the ninth layer, we have 29524, and then we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3: that's layer 1.\n\n- Then, each time we wrap it in another 1 + 3*(...): that's layers 2 through 9.\n\nSo, layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing layer 9 as 29524, the outermost is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that layer 9 is indeed 29524. Let me compute each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So layer 9 is 29524, and then the outermost is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer simplifies step by step until the final result is obtained.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think the key here is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of problems. Let me try to visualize it or maybe write it down in a more structured way.\n\nLet me count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me see, how many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses. From the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 3 multiplied by something. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 8 layers? Let me check again. Each time, the expression inside is another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the innermost 1+3. Each layer adds one more. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, so there are 8 layers? Let me confirm by counting the number of times 3 is multiplied. Each time, the expression inside is multiplied by 3, so each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of 3s multiplied:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that starting from the outermost 3, each inner layer adds another 3. So, the number of layers is 8. Therefore, I need to compute this expression by starting from the innermost and working my way out.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nLet's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L8, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L8) = 3*9841 = ?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me see the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times we have \"1+3\". Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nSo, yes, 8 layers. Therefore, L1 to L8 as above.\n\nBut when I calculated L8, I got 9841, and then the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523. But let me verify each step because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLet me go step by step again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841 = ?\n\nCalculating 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, the total is 29,523.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing exponentially, and 8 layers might lead to a very large number, but let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence relation, if we have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition to find A.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4.\n\nBut wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nUsing the general solution:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe know B = -1/2, so:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 8 layers, so n=8.\n\nTherefore, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the innermost expression after 8 layers is 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29,523.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if the number of layers is indeed 8. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the initial 3 is outside, so the number of layers is 8, as each \"3(\" corresponds to a layer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to see it is that each \"1+3\" corresponds to a new layer, and there are 8 such layers after the initial 3.\n\nSo, yes, 8 layers, leading to a_8 = 9841, then multiplied by 3 gives 29,523.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 29,523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 9841. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer).\n3. After computing all 8 layers, the result is 9841.\n4. Multiply this result by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{29523}"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of problems.\n\nAlright, so the innermost part is \"1+3\". Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, let's look at the next layer. It's 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the structure is 1 + 3(...). So each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers.

But the original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.

So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, so perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outwards, computing each layer as I go.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 2: 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 3: 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute: 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 4: 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute: 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 5: 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute: 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute: 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute: 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute: 3*9841. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is \"1+3\". Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Each time, the innermost one is the last one. So maybe I should number them for clarity.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3( ... )) where ... is the result of step 1\n3. Similarly, each subsequent step builds on the previous one.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this more systematically. Let me try to write each step down, starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3\nThat's easy: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So:\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(4)\nLet me compute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, now, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So:\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(13)\nFirst, 3*13 = 39\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing this way, let's do Step 4:\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*(40)\n3*40 = 120\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me double-check my calculations so far.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, moving on to Step 5:\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*(121)\n3*121 = 363\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, that's a big jump, but let's keep going.\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*(364)\n3*364 = 1092\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, okay, this is growing rapidly. Let's proceed.\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*(1093)\n3*1093 = 3279\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*(3280)\n3*3280 = 9840\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*(9841)\n3*9841 = 29523\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me count how many steps I've done. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, so each step corresponds to one set. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which was Step 1, each subsequent step is moving outwards. So if I did nine steps, that should cover all the parentheses.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I went up to Step 9, which gave me 29524. Let me recount the steps to make sure I didn't skip any or do an extra.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine steps, each time moving out one level. So, the final result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by that entire expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the result we just got, 29524.\n\nSo, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8\nSo, putting it together: 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps. It's easy to make an error when dealing with so many nested parentheses.\n\nLet me retrace each step:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but given the structure, it's just repeated multiplication and addition, so step-by-step evaluation seems the most straightforward method.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, so maybe it's a recursive sequence. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth expression from the inside. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the sequence is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, since there are nine levels.\n\nSo, let's compute a_2 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculations. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that solidifies the answer further.

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. I think the key is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression to make it a bit clearer. The innermost part is 1+3, right? Let me start there.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1+3, which is 4. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(that result). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9. So layer 1 is the innermost, layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving out one layer, layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(result from layer 1). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that. If layer 1 is 1+3=4, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(4). So 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yes, that seems right.\n\nMoving on to layer 3, which is 1 + 3*(result from layer 2). So:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, 3*364. Let me calculate that again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, let me check that. 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524.\n\nSo, now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from layer 9, right? Wait, no. Wait, let me see the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the outermost layer is 3*(result from layer 9). So, after computing layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes, when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let's see, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first is (1+3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen layer 2: 1+3*(layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(layer2)\n\n...\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each time it's wrapped in another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? Because each time you go out a layer, you have another 1+3(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which we computed as 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, no. Let me make sure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, if the inner expression evaluates to 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big number. Let me compute that. 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572.\n\nSo, the total would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let's recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer1: 4\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(result).\n\nSo, layer2: 1 +3*4=13\n\nlayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nlayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nlayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nlayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nlayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nlayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nlayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen the outermost is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it step by step again.\n\nLet me list each layer with its result:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Each part is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so I should handle the innermost ones first.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 multiplied by that result. So 3 * 4 is 12. \n\nWait, but that's just the innermost part. Let me try to parse this properly. Each time, it's 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me list out the layers from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: (1 + result from step 2)\n4. Then: 3*(result from step 3)\n5. Continue this process until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number these layers to make it clearer. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each \"3(\" is a new layer.

So starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards to the first layer.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1 to L9, where L9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, computing each step as I go.\n\nSo starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, it's 3*(Layer 1 result) = 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 12) = 13\n\nThen, moving out another layer, it's 3*13 = 39\n\nNext layer: (1 + 39) = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120\n\nNext layer: (1 + 120) = 121\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363\n\nNext layer: (1 + 363) = 364\n\nThen, 3*364 = 1092\n\nNext layer: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n\nThen, 3*1093 = 3279\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n\nThen, 3*3280 = 9840\n\nNext layer: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's another 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of times 3( appears after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number the layers from the innermost as L1 to L9, but each layer is either a 3*(...) or a (1 + ...). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next inner expression. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen, next layer: (1 + 12) = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*(13) = 39\n\nNext layer: (1 + 39) = 40\n\nNext layer: 3*(40) = 120\n\nNext layer: (1 + 120) = 121\n\nNext layer: 3*(121) = 363\n\nNext layer: (1 + 363) = 364\n\nNext layer: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, but that's 9 layers, so I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me see:\n\nWait, if I start with (1 + 3) = 4, that's the innermost, then each time I go out, I do 3*(previous result) and then add 1, except for the last layer which is just 3*(previous result). Hmm, maybe I'm not structuring this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result).\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a recursive function. Let me denote f(n) as the value of the nth layer from the innermost. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15? Wait, no, that's not matching what I had before.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when I computed earlier, I had different numbers. Maybe my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so after the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), so let me count again. Each time I do 3*(1 + previous result), that's one layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, if there are 9 layers, I need to compute 9 times.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I thought that each layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, but that might not be the case. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nStep 3: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nStep 4: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nStep 5: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nStep 6: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nStep 7: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nStep 8: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nStep 9: Compute next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that gives me 36084 as the final result. But when I did the initial step-by-step earlier, I got 29523, which is different. So, I must have made a mistake in my counting or computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts.\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time I see 3(1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 3( appears after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 instances of 3(1 + 3(...). So, there are 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let me compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so the final result is 36084? But earlier I thought it was 29523. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost and working outward, keeping track of each step carefully.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, so the final result is 36084. But earlier, when I thought I had 9 layers, I got a different result. Maybe I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each time I compute 3*(1 + ...), that's one layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is one layer. So, if there are 9 layers, I should compute 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I'm not missing any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, after 9 layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 29523, but that must have been a miscalculation. Let me verify each step again to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Layer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, so the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers, but when I first computed, I got 29523, which is different. Let me check that initial computation again to see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 3*(1 + previous layer). So, layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, so 9 layers, resulting in 36084.\n\nWait, but the original problem only has 9 layers, so that should be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this with a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions.\n\nThis kind of expression is a nested multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nWe can write:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = k*(c + a_{n-1}), where k and c are constants.\n\nIn this case, k = 3 and c = 1.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nP = 3*(1 + P)\n\nP = 3 + 3P\n\nP - 3P = 3\n\n-2P = 3\n\nP = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nNow, we need to compute a_9.\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11 * 19683 = Let's compute 10*19683 = 196830, plus 1*19683 = 19683, so total is 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nDivide by 6: 216504 / 6 = 36084\n\nYes, that matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 9 layers, I got 36084, but I initially thought 29523. I must have made a mistake in that earlier calculation by miscounting the layers or miscalculating one of the steps. But using both iterative step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at 36084, so that must be the correct answer.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, but with the recurrence relation approach, it's clear that the answer is 36084.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from (1 + 3) = 4. By computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ \n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to visualize it. It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something), and that something is another similar expression. So, it's like a chain of these 3*(1 + ...) terms. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, that 4 is inside another 3*(1 + ...). So, the next layer would be 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nOkay, so that layer simplifies to 15. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is 15. So, let's compute that:\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nAlright, so now that layer is 48. Let me keep going. The next layer out is another 3*(1 + 48):\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nHmm, so that's 147. Moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 147):\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nWait, 148 times 3 is 444? Let me check that again. 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24, so 300+120=420, plus 24 is 444. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 444):\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nHmm, 445*3. Let me verify: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320, plus 15 is 1335. Yep, that's right.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 1335):\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336\n\nWait, 1336*3. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So adding them up: 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. So that's 4008.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 3*(1 + 4008):\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009\n\nCalculating 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027.\n\nNow, the next layer is 3*(1 + 12027):\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028\n\nLet me compute 12028*3. 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 28*3=84. Adding them up: 30000+6000=36000, 36000+84=36084.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but the original problem has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. Continuing, that's 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, so when I was going through the layers, I went up to 36084, which was the 9th layer. So that should be the final result.\n\nBut let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and so on. So, starting from the innermost, each layer builds on the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2082), where a\u2082 is the next layer. But since it's nested, it's a\u2081 = 3*(1 + a\u2082), a\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2083), and so on, until a\u2089 = 3*(1 + a\u2081\u2080), where a\u2081\u2080 = 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, so a\u2081\u2080 would be 4, right?\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a\u2099 as the value of the nth layer from the inside. So, starting from the innermost, a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2083), but wait, actually, each a\u2099 = 3*(1 + a\u2099\u208a\u2081). Hmm, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it as a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote the innermost as 4, then the next is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15)=48, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I can write each term as 3^n multiplied by something. Let's see:\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 3*(1 + a\u2081) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na\u2083 = 3*(1 + a\u2082) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na\u2084 = 3*(1 + a\u2083) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na\u2085 = 3*(1 + a\u2084) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na\u2086 = 3*(1 + a\u2085) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na\u2087 = 3*(1 + a\u2086) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na\u2088 = 3*(1 + a\u2087) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na\u2089 = 3*(1 + a\u2088) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, yes, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, starting from a\u2081 = 4, each subsequent term is 3*(1 + a\u2099\u208b\u2081). So, if I want to find a general formula, maybe I can express a\u2099 in terms of a\u2081.\n\nBut given that there are only 9 layers, it's probably easier to compute each step manually as I did before, rather than trying to find a closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each term is 3 times (1 + previous term), which can be written as a\u2099 = 3*(1 + a\u2099\u208b\u2081). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na\u2099 = 3*(1 + a\u2099\u208b\u2081), with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence. First, let's write it as:\n\na\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 3/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3\u00b9 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3A\n\nSo, A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = (11/6)*3\u207f - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u2099 = (11/6)*3\u207f - (3/2)\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na\u2099 = (11*3\u207f)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3\u207f - 9)/6\n\nAlternatively, factoring:\n\na\u2099 = (11*3\u207f - 9)/6\n\nSo, now, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, we can compute a\u2089.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step computation, a\u2089 was 36084. Let's see if this formula gives the same result.\n\nCompute a\u2089 using the formula:\n\na\u2089 = (11*3\u2079 - 9)/6\n\nFirst, compute 3\u2079:\n\n3\u00b9 = 3\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n3\u00b3 = 27\n\n3\u2074 = 81\n\n3\u2075 = 243\n\n3\u2076 = 729\n\n3\u2077 = 2187\n\n3\u2078 = 6561\n\n3\u2079 = 19683\n\nSo, 11*19683 = let's compute that.\n\n11*19683:\n\nCompute 10*19683 = 196830\n\nCompute 1*19683 = 19683\n\nAdd them together: 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nNow, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nDivide by 6: 216504 / 6\n\nCompute that:\n\n216504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6*36000 = 216000\n\n216504 - 216000 = 504\n\n504 \u00f7 6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36000 + 84 = 36084\n\nYes! So, using the formula, a\u2089 = 36084, which matches our step-by-step computation. That's reassuring.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 36084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by simplifying the innermost expression and work our way outwards.

    "text": " \n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to parse it. It seems like there's a pattern here. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\nLet me write down the expression to make it clearer. I'll number the parentheses from the inside out so I can keep track.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3\n\nSo, let's compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So:\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nMoving another level out, we have:\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext level:\n\n5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nMoving on:\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n\nThat's 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nNext step:\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nNext step:\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n\nSo, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost level:\n\n10. The entire expression: 3*(result from step 9)\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let's calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because 3*29524 seems a bit large. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nThere's no more digits, so we're done.\n\nWait, that gives us 88572. So, yes, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step builds on the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards. Each time, we compute the innermost expression, substitute it into the next level, and so on until we reach the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nLet me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I did step 3, I thought 1 + 3*13 is 40, which is correct because 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Then step 4: 1 + 3*40 is 121, correct. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 is 364, correct. Then step 6: 1 + 3*364, which is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093, which is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280, which is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841, which is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each time we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). This seems like a recursive pattern. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to generalize it. Suppose we have n levels of such expressions. Let me denote the expression with k levels as E_k, where E_k = 3*(1 + E_{k-1}).\n\nWait, but in our problem, each level is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps E_k = 3*(1 + E_{k-1}), with E_1 = 3*(1 + something). Wait, no, actually, each step is 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, then multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe not exactly.\n\nWait, let me check: For example, starting from the innermost, E_1 = 1 + 3, then E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, up to E_9, and then the entire expression is 3*E_9.\n\nWait, so perhaps the general formula for E_n where n is the number of layers. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nLet me compute the first few E_n:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, so perhaps each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say E_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with n=1:\n\nE_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works perfectly for each step. Therefore, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result without manually computing each step, which is much more efficient, especially if n were larger.\n\nBut in this problem, n=9, so it's manageable either way.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a bit different because each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, each step is a linear transformation, which we've modeled with the recurrence relation.\n\nBut either way, the result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recompute the final multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying the result using both iterative computation and a derived formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can solve each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nSo, let's rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another parentheses: (1 + 3(...)). Since we just computed the inner part as 4, let's substitute that in.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next parentheses. So, it's 1 + 3*(result of the inner parentheses). So, actually, the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nOkay, so that layer gives us 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another (1 + 3*(...)). Substituting the previous result, which is 13, into this.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13). Let's compute that. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nAlright, so that gives us 40. Now, moving out another layer.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40). Calculating that, 3*40 is 120, then 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nHmm, 121. That seems a bit large, but okay. Let's keep going.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121). So, 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nWow, that's getting big quickly. Let's proceed.\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364). Calculating that, 3*364 is 1092, then 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nOkay, 1093. Now, moving out another layer.\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093 first. 1093*3: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nSo, that's 3280. Moving out another layer.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nWow, 9841. That's a pretty big number. Let's keep going.\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841). Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nAlright, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer.\n\n10. The outermost layer is 3*(result from the previous step). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in any of the previous computations. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and each multiplication and addition looks correct. So, I think I did this right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that it's only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually seems manageable. If it were deeper, maybe there's a formula, but here, step-by-step is fine.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer from the inside out, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Compute the innermost (1 + 3):\n   That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, actually, looking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me number each step for clarity.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of nested expressions. Each time we have a 3 multiplied by another (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\nThen, 3*(that result)\nThen, 1 + 3*(that)\nAnd this repeats until we've done it nine times, I think.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me check how many levels there are. Each time I'm moving outward, I'm adding another level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...)) is a level.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the last (1 + 3) before the closing parentheses. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each level step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each level as L1, L2, ..., up to L9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me look again. Each time I have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...), so the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3s multiplied inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3). Then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nWait, but in the given expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe the first operation is 3*(1 + 3), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, computing each step carefully.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3):\n\n1. Compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext level out, we have 1 + 3*(13):\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext level:\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext:\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext:\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext:\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext:\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext:\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the number of levels. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th level, and each level before that adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I counted up to 29524, that was after 9 levels. So then, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by that 29524.\n\nSo, after computing up to 29524, which is the result of the innermost 9 levels, we have:\n\n10. 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me recount the number of levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) as level 1:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations for each level to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, so the answer should be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 + 3 times the result of the previous step. After computing each level up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Proceed to the next level by computing 1 + 3*(previous result):\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first.\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nOkay, so now, the next layer out is another parentheses that contains this result. Let me write that down. The next part is (1 + 3(...)). Since the innermost was 4, the next one would be:\n\n1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, substituting the 4, it becomes:\n\n1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have another parentheses that looks like (1 + 3*(...)). The inner part here is 13, so substituting that in:\n\n1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that, 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nOkay, so that layer is 40. Let's keep going. The next layer is again (1 + 3*(...)), and the inner part is 40, so:\n\n1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nAlright, that's 121. Moving out another layer, we have:\n\n1 + 3*121.\n\nCalculating that, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364.\n\nWait, hold on, 3*121 is 363, right? Because 100*3 is 300, 20*3 is 60, and 1*3 is 3, so 300 + 60 + 3 is 363. Then adding 1 gives 364. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's:\n\n1 + 3*364.\n\nLet me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check again. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1092 + 1 is 1093. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nOkay, so 3*1093. Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 is 3280.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let's see. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nSo, 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nWait, that seems correct. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 9841. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. 9841 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nThen, 29,523 + 1 = 29,524. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 24*3=72. So adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Then, adding 1 gives 88,573.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. So, 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Then, 88,572 + 1 = 88,573. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute 3*88,573. Hmm, 80,000*3=240,000; 8,000*3=24,000; 500*3=1,500; 70*3=210; 3*3=9. So adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives 265,720.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 88,573 * 3: 80,000*3=240,000; 8,000*3=24,000; 500*3=1,500; 70*3=210; 3*3=9. So 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500; 265,500 + 210 is 265,710; 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives 265,720. Correct.\n\nAlright, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*265720.\n\nSo, 3*265,720. Let me compute that. 200,000*3=600,000; 60,000*3=180,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 700*3=2,100; 20*3=60. Adding those up: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. Then, adding 1 gives 797,161.\n\nWait, let me double-check. 265,720 * 3: 200,000*3=600,000; 60,000*3=180,000; 5,000*3=15,000; 700*3=2,100; 20*3=60. So, 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 is 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 is 797,100; 797,100 + 60 is 797,160. Then, 797,160 + 1 is 797,161. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*797161.\n\nLet me compute 3*797,161. Hmm, 700,000*3=2,100,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 7,000*3=21,000; 100*3=300; 60*3=180; 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483. Then, adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 797,161 * 3: 700,000*3=2,100,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 7,000*3=21,000; 100*3=300; 60*3=180; 1*3=3. So, 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483. Then, 2,391,483 + 1 = 2,391,484. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 2,391,484. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*2,391,484.\n\nLet me compute 3*2,391,484. Hmm, 2,000,000*3=6,000,000; 300,000*3=900,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 1,000*3=3,000; 400*3=1,200; 80*3=240; 4*3=12. Adding those together: 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000; 6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000; 7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000; 7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200; 7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440; 7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452. Then, adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication. 2,391,484 * 3: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000; 300,000*3=900,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 1,000*3=3,000; 400*3=1,200; 80*3=240; 4*3=12. So, 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000; 6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000; 7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000; 7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200; 7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440; 7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452. Then, 7,174,452 + 1 = 7,174,453. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 7,174,453. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*7,174,453.\n\nLet me compute 3*7,174,453. Hmm, 7,000,000*3=21,000,000; 100,000*3=300,000; 70,000*3=210,000; 4,000*3=12,000; 400*3=1,200; 50*3=150; 3*3=9. Adding those together: 21,000,000 + 300,000 = 21,300,000; 21,300,000 + 210,000 = 21,510,000; 21,510,000 + 12,000 = 21,522,000; 21,522,000 + 1,200 = 21,523,200; 21,523,200 + 150 = 21,523,350; 21,523,350 + 9 = 21,523,359. Then, adding 1 gives 21,523,360.\n\nWait, let me check that. 7,174,453 * 3: 7,000,000*3=21,000,000; 100,000*3=300,000; 70,000*3=210,000; 4,000*3=12,000; 400*3=1,200; 50*3=150; 3*3=9. So, 21,000,000 + 300,000 = 21,300,000; 21,300,000 + 210,000 = 21,510,000; 21,510,000 + 12,000 = 21,522,000; 21,522,000 + 1,200 = 21,523,200; 21,523,200 + 150 = 21,523,350; 21,523,350 + 9 = 21,523,359. Then, 21,523,359 + 1 = 21,523,360. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 21,523,360. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*21,523,360.\n\nLet me compute 3*21,523,360. Hmm, 20,000,000*3=60,000,000; 1,523,360*3. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently would help. Let's see:\n\n21,523,360 * 3: 20,000,000*3=60,000,000; 1,523,360*3. Let me compute 1,523,360 * 3:\n\n1,000,000*3=3,000,000;\n\n500,000*3=1,500,000;\n\n23,360*3: 20,000*3=60,000; 3,360*3=10,080.\n\nSo, 23,360*3=60,000 + 10,080=70,080.\n\nSo, 1,523,360*3=3,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 70,080=4,570,080.\n\nTherefore, 21,523,360*3=60,000,000 + 4,570,080=64,570,080.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 64,570,081.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 21,523,360 * 3: 20,000,000*3=60,000,000; 1,523,360*3=4,570,080 (as above). So, 60,000,000 + 4,570,080=64,570,080. Then, 64,570,080 + 1=64,570,081. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 64,570,081. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*64,570,081.\n\nLet me compute 3*64,570,081. Hmm, 60,000,000*3=180,000,000; 4,570,081*3. Let's compute that:\n\n4,000,000*3=12,000,000;\n\n500,000*3=1,500,000;\n\n70,000*3=210,000;\n\n81*3=243.\n\nSo, 4,570,081*3=12,000,000 + 1,500,000 + 210,000 + 243=13,710,243.\n\nTherefore, 64,570,081*3=180,000,000 + 13,710,243=193,710,243.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 193,710,244.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 64,570,081 * 3: 60,000,000*3=180,000,000; 4,570,081*3=13,710,243. So, 180,000,000 + 13,710,243=193,710,243. Then, 193,710,243 + 1=193,710,244. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 193,710,244. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*193,710,244.\n\nLet me compute 3*193,710,244. Hmm, 100,000,000*3=300,000,000; 90,000,000*3=270,000,000; 3,710,244*3. Let's compute that:\n\n3,000,000*3=9,000,000;\n\n700,000*3=2,100,000;\n\n10,000*3=30,000;\n\n244*3=732.\n\nSo, 3,710,244*3=9,000,000 + 2,100,000 + 30,000 + 732=11,130,732.\n\nTherefore, 193,710,244*3=270,000,000 + 11,130,732=281,130,732.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 193,710,244 is 100,000,000 + 90,000,000 + 3,710,244. So, 100,000,000*3=300,000,000; 90,000,000*3=270,000,000; 3,710,244*3=11,130,732. So, 300,000,000 + 270,000,000=570,000,000; 570,000,000 + 11,130,732=581,130,732.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I think I miscalculated the breakdown. Let me correct that.\n\n193,710,244 is composed as 100,000,000 + 90,000,000 + 3,710,244.\n\nSo, 100,000,000*3=300,000,000;\n\n90,000,000*3=270,000,000;\n\n3,710,244*3=11,130,732.\n\nAdding them together: 300,000,000 + 270,000,000 = 570,000,000; 570,000,000 + 11,130,732 = 581,130,732.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 581,130,733.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with my earlier step. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, 193,710,244 * 3: \n\n100,000,000*3=300,000,000;\n\n90,000,000*3=270,000,000;\n\n3,000,000*3=9,000,000;\n\n700,000*3=2,100,000;\n\n10,000*3=30,000;\n\n244*3=732.\n\nSo, adding all together: 300,000,000 + 270,000,000 = 570,000,000; 570,000,000 + 9,000,000 = 579,000,000; 579,000,000 + 2,100,000 = 581,100,000; 581,100,000 + 30,000 = 581,130,000; 581,130,000 + 732 = 581,130,732. Then, adding 1 gives 581,130,733.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 193,710,244*3=281,130,732, which is incorrect. The correct value is 581,130,732. Then, adding 1 gives 581,130,733.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in breaking down the number earlier. Let me make sure.\n\n193,710,244: 100,000,000 + 90,000,000 + 3,710,244. So, 100,000,000*3=300,000,000; 90,000,000*3=270,000,000; 3,710,244*3=11,130,732. So, 300,000,000 + 270,000,000 = 570,000,000; 570,000,000 + 11,130,732 = 581,130,732. Then, 581,130,732 + 1 = 581,130,733.\n\nYes, that's correct. I must have miscalculated earlier when I thought it was 281 million. So, it's 581,130,733.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 581,130,733. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*581,130,733.\n\nLet me compute 3*581,130,733. Hmm, 500,000,000*3=1,500,000,000; 80,000,000*3=240,000,000; 1,130,733*3. Let's compute that:\n\n1,000,000*3=3,000,000;\n\n130,000*3=390,000;\n\n733*3=2,199.\n\nSo, 1,130,733*3=3,000,000 + 390,000 + 2,199=3,392,199.\n\nTherefore, 581,130,733*3=1,500,000,000 + 240,000,000 + 3,392,199=1,743,392,199.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. 581,130,733*3: 500,000,000*3=1,500,000,000; 80,000,000*3=240,000,000; 1,130,733*3=3,392,199. So, 1,500,000,000 + 240,000,000 = 1,740,000,000; 1,740,000,000 + 3,392,199 = 1,743,392,199. Then, adding 1 gives 1,743,392,200.\n\nWait, 1,743,392,199 + 1 is 1,743,392,200. Correct.\n\nAlright, so that layer is 1,743,392,200. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*1,743,392,200.\n\nLet me compute 3*1,743,392,200. Hmm, 1,000,000,000*3=3,000,000,000; 700,000,000*3=2,100,000,000; 43,392,200*3. Let's compute that:\n\n40,000,000*3=120,000,000;\n\n3,392,200*3=10,176,600.\n\nSo, 43,392,200*3=120,000,000 + 10,176,600=130,176,600.\n\nTherefore, 1,743,392,200*3=3,000,000,000 + 2,100,000,000 + 130,176,600=5,230,176,600.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 5,230,176,601.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 1,743,392,200*3: 1,000,000,000*3=3,000,000,000; 700,000,000*3=2,100,000,000; 43,392,200*3=130,176,600. So, 3,000,000,00"

Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to solve the innermost parentheses first and then move outward. So, let's identify where the innermost part is.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part seems to be the last (1 + 3). Let me write that down:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading it correctly. The structure is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times the next inner expression). So, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + 3*next_layer).\n\nLet me try to visualize this as layers. There are nine sets of parentheses, so I think there are nine layers to compute. Let me number them from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving to layer 2, which is 1 + 3*(layer 1 result). So,\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, that seems correct. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nNow, layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(layer 2 result), which is 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay, let's go on.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, that's getting large. Let me check if I'm doing this right. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous layer's result.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out more systematically to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Because each layer is inside another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I've miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again. It's:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). So, perhaps the initial approach was correct, but I need to adjust for the fact that each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I was correct in the way I calculated each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), but then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent each layer as L1 to L9, where each L is the result of the innermost expression, and then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps I should model it as:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + L_prev), where L_prev is the result from the previous layer.\n\nWait, that might be a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step out is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + next_layer). So, maybe the way I calculated L2 to L9 was correct, but then the total expression is 3*(L9). Wait, but in my initial calculation, I ended up with L9 as 29524, which would then be multiplied by 3. But that seems too large, and I think I might have made a mistake in how I counted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of layers. Let's see, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is the last (1 + 3), then each preceding \"3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time computing the next layer.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nStart with the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this L1.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*L1). Wait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer).\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*inner_expression). So, for example, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*4). Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(3*(1 + 3*4))), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, L2 is 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, that seems different from before. So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). So, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that's a different approach, and the numbers are growing faster.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong before. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the expression correctly.\n\nEach time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nThen, next layer: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nWait, this is different from my initial approach where I added 1 and then multiplied by 3 each time. So, perhaps I was confusing the order of operations before.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each step is 3*(1 + 3*inner_result).\n\nSo, let me list each layer:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404\n\nWait, but that seems way too big. Did I do that correctly? Let me check the calculations step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculating L5 onwards because the numbers are getting too large, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again carefully.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 3*354). Let's compute 3*354 first: 354 * 3 = 1062. Then, 1 + 1062 = 1063. Then, 3*1063: 1063 * 3 = 3189. Correct.\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189). Compute 3*3189: 3189 * 3. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 189*3=567, so total 9000+567=9567. Then, 1 + 9567 = 9568. Then, 3*9568: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 568*3=1,704. So, 27,000 + 1,704 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 3*28,704). Compute 3*28,704: 28,704 * 3. Let's compute 20,000*3=60,000, 8,704*3=26,112. So, total 60,000 + 26,112 = 86,112. Then, 1 + 86,112 = 86,113. Then, 3*86,113: 80,000*3=240,000, 6,113*3=18,339. So, total 240,000 + 18,339 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339). Compute 3*258,339: Let's compute 200,000*3=600,000, 58,339*3=175,017. So, total 600,000 + 175,017 = 775,017. Then, 1 + 775,017 = 775,018. Then, 3*775,018: 700,000*3=2,100,000, 75,018*3=225,054. So, total 2,100,000 + 225,054 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054). Compute 3*2,325,054: Let's compute 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 325,054*3=975,162. So, total 6,000,000 + 975,162 = 6,975,162. Then, 1 + 6,975,162 = 6,975,163. Then, 3*6,975,163: 6,000,000*3=18,000,000, 975,163*3=2,925,489. So, total 18,000,000 + 2,925,489 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489). Compute 3*20,925,489: Let's compute 20,000,000*3=60,000,000, 925,489*3=2,776,467. So, total 60,000,000 + 2,776,467 = 62,776,467. Then, 1 + 62,776,467 = 62,776,468. Then, 3*62,776,468: Let's compute 60,000,000*3=180,000,000, 2,776,468*3=8,329,404. So, total 180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\" from the innermost part:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears:\n\n- The innermost is 3(...), so that's one layer.\n\n- Then each \"3(\" before that adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is the last (1 + 3), and each preceding \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count how many times \"3(\" occurs before the innermost:\n\n- The first \"3(\" is at the very beginning: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\n- Then, each subsequent \"3(\" is nested inside. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nLayer 3: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, L9 is the outermost layer, which is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that each layer was 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer), which led me to L9 being 188,329,404. But when I first approached it, I thought of each layer as 1 + 3*previous_layer, which gave me a different result. So, I think the confusion was in whether each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer) or 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nWait, let me re-express the original problem to clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*...). Therefore, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). So, the way I computed L2 to L9 as 3*(1 + 3*L_prev) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but just to be sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nLet me take a smaller version with just two layers:\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nFollowing my method:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: three layers.\n\nCompute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nCompute directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120? Wait, that's different. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, no, wait. If I compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nBut according to my layer method, I got 354. That's a discrepancy. So, that means my layer approach is wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in the three-layer case, my approach gave 354, but direct computation gives 120. Therefore, my method is incorrect.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me re-express the three-layer case.\n\nExpression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost first: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, moving outward again: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nBut when I compute it directly, I get:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different. So, clearly, my approach is wrong. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))).\n\nWait, in the three-layer case, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWhich is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, in this case, the three-layer expression evaluates to 120, not 354 as I previously thought.\n\nWait, so that means my initial approach was wrong because I was treating each layer as 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer), but in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is computed as 1 + 3*next_layer, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me try again with the three-layer case.\n\nStart with innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, next layer out is 1 + 3*(innermost) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next_layer)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so in this case, the structure is:\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*next_layer)\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*innermost\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\n\nSo, perhaps I was wrong in my initial approach where I multiplied by 3 at each layer. Instead, only the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, and each inner layer is 1 + 3*next_layer.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the three-layer case, it's:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each time you go out a layer, you have to multiply by 3 again. So, in the three-layer case, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nSo, in that case, the number of multiplications by 3 depends on the number of layers. So, perhaps each layer adds another multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count how many times \"3(\" appears:\n\n1. The innermost is 3(...), so that's one layer.\n\n2. Then, moving out, each \"3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nLayer 3: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, meaning that the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(1 + 3*...).\n\nWait, but in the three-layer case, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, perhaps in the original problem, with 9 layers, the result would be 3^9 times something? Or maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLet me try to compute a few layers manually to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(9568) = 28704\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(86113) = 258339\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(775018) = 2325054\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(6975163) = 20925489\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(62776468) = 188329404\n\nWait, so according to this, the result is 188,329,404.\n\nBut earlier, when I tested the three-layer case with my initial approach, I got 354, but when I computed it directly, I got 120. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, but in the three-layer case, the correct result is 120, whereas according to the method I used above, it's 354. So, that method must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how I'm interpreting the layers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). So, for the three-layer case, it's:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nWait, but that's not matching the direct computation. Wait, no, in the three-layer case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so that suggests that each layer is not 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer), but rather, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, except for the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that the innermost layers are 1 + 3*something, and the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*something).\n\nWait, let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me consider that each time, the expression is of the form:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, except the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*...).\n\nWait, so for the three-layer case, it's:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12))\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*13)\n\n= 3*(1 + 39)\n\n= 3*40 = 120.\n\nSimilarly, for the two-layer case:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nSo, in this case, each layer beyond the innermost is 1 + 3*next_layer, and the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*...).\n\nTherefore, perhaps in the original problem, the structure is that we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*something, and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems different from my previous calculations. So,"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the expression is a series of 1s and 3s connected by addition and multiplication. Each layer seems to be 3 times (1 + something). Maybe there's a pattern here that I can exploit.\n\nLet me try to write this out step by step. I'll start by labeling each parenthesis level from the inside out. Let's say the innermost part is level 1, then moving outward, it's level 2, and so on, up to level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nStarting with level 1: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. \n\nThen, moving to level 2: 1 + 3*(result from level 1). Since level 1 gave me 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, level 2 is 13.\n\nNext, level 3: 1 + 3*(result from level 2). Level 2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives me 40. So, level 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to level 4: 1 + 3*(result from level 3). Level 3 was 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives me 121. Level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(result from level 4). Level 4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives me 364. Level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(result from level 5). Level 5 was 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives me 1093. Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(result from level 6). Level 6 was 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives me 3280. Level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(result from level 7). Level 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives me 9841. Level 8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, level 9: 1 + 3*(result from level 8). Level 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives me 29524. Level 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the result from level 9. So, after computing level 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3*29524.\n\nHmm, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3. \n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000. Then, 9000*3 = 27000. 500*3 = 1500. 20*3 = 60. 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I should do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I add 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3, I get 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, actually, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing level 9. Let me go back through each level to check.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, level 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication because 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute it another way.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 7 2 7 5 7 2 4? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm writing the digits in reverse.\n\nWait, when you multiply, you start from the rightmost digit and move left, so the first digit is 2, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 7, then 2, then 7. Wait, that can't be right. Let me write it out properly.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n     29524\n   \u00d7      3\n   ---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nSo, putting it together from top to bottom, the digits are 7, 2, 7, 5, 7, 2, 4? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, when you write it out, the digits go from right to left, so the first digit is 2, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 7, then 2, then 7.\n\nWait, but that would make it 727572, which is not correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Wait, I must be getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStart from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 2, 7. Wait, that would make the number 727572, but that's not right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me check again. 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572, which is a 5-digit number. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm writing the digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n     29524\n   \u00d7      3\n   ---------\n     88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another method. Let's add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in computing each level. Let me go through each step again.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to the final result after nine layers of nesting, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parenthesis (Level 1):**\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, I can count each set of parentheses. Let me try to write it out more clearly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n3. Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer).\n\nWait, so this seems like a recursive or iterative process where each layer depends on the result of the one inside it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. Let's see:\n\n- L1: 1 + 3\n- L2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n- L3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n- ...\n- L9: 1 + 3*(L8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*(L9). So I need to compute L1 through L9, starting from L1.\n\nLet me compute each layer one by one.\n\n**Step 1: Compute L1**\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Step 2: Compute L2**\nL2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n**Step 3: Compute L3**\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n**Step 4: Compute L4**\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n**Step 5: Compute L5**\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n**Step 6: Compute L6**\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n**Step 7: Compute L7**\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n**Step 8: Compute L8**\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n**Step 9: Compute L9**\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so let's compute that:\n\nTotal = 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that multiplication:\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n\nNext, 3 * 500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3 * 20 = 60\n\nAnd finally, 3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, so adding up each part:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000 \u2192 Total so far: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500 \u2192 Total: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3 * 20 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n3 * 4 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check it another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before, so I think that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nLet me just check if I made any mistakes in the layers. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo each layer seems correct. Then 3*29524 is 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually.\n\nWait, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, when n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\nL1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, that works. So the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, L9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, L_3, \\ldots, L_9 \\) where each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute \\( L_1 \\):\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute \\( L_2 \\):\n   \\[ L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can approach this. I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each layer one by one without getting confused. \n\nAlright, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So the next step is:\n\nSecond layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n\nThen, we add 1 to that result. So:\n\nThird layer: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, multiply by 3 again:\n\nFourth layer: 3 * 13 = 39\n\nAdding 1:\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nSixth layer: 3 * 40 = 120\n\nAdd 1:\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nEighth layer: 3 * 121 = 363\n\nAdd 1:\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nTenth layer: 3 * 364 = 1092\n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Each time, I'm taking the result from the innermost parentheses, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving out. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3 * 4 = 12\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n4. 3 * 13 = 39\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n6. 3 * 40 = 120\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n8. 3 * 121 = 363\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n10. 3 * 364 = 1092\n\nYes, that's ten layers in total, each time working from the inside out. So, the final result after all these operations is 1092. \n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think of this as a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, we can write this recursively:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nWait a second, that's different from what I got earlier. Did I make a mistake in my initial calculation? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, in the problem, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the entire expression, so actually, the total number of layers might be nine instead of ten. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a separate layer, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. From the expression, I can see that there are nine instances of \"1 + 3(\", which would mean nine layers inside the outermost 3(...). So the total layers are nine, each adding one more layer inward.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to the tenth layer, which gave me 1092. But using the recursive approach, f(9) would be different. Let me try this again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) + 1 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's way different from my initial calculation. So now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me look again at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", so let's count how many times this occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's nine times. So the innermost is the ninth layer, and then each layer wraps around. So when I compute starting from the innermost, I have nine layers before the outermost 3.\n\nSo, let's compute step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*Layer1 + 1 = 3*4 +1 =13\n\nLayer3:3*Layer2 +1=3*13+1=40\n\nLayer4:3*Layer3 +1=3*40+1=121\n\nLayer5:3*Layer4 +1=3*121+1=364\n\nLayer6:3*Layer5 +1=3*364+1=1093\n\nLayer7:3*Layer6 +1=3*1093+1=3280\n\nLayer8:3*Layer7 +1=3*3280+1=9841\n\nLayer9:3*Layer8 +1=3*9841+1=29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) =3*29524=88572\n\nWait, that's a different result. So which one is correct? Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" corresponds to a layer, starting from the innermost. So the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around. So the number of layers is nine, as each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer.\n\nSo, using the recursive approach, f(1) = 4, f(2) =13, f(3)=40, f(4)=121, f(5)=364, f(6)=1093, f(7)=3280, f(8)=9841, f(9)=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572\n\nBut earlier, when I did it step by step, I ended up with 1092, which is different. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me try to compute it step by step again, more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\n5. Next:1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\n6. Next:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\n7. Next:1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280\n\n8. Next:1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\n9. Next:1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\n10. Outermost:3*29524=88572\n\nWait, so now I have ten layers. So the confusion is whether the outermost 3 is considered a layer or not.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside. So the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), and finally, the outermost is 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent layer up to layer 9, and then the outermost 3 is applied to layer 9. So, total layers: 9 inner layers, plus the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had ten layers, but the outermost is just a multiplication, not a (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nCompute layer1 =1 +3=4\n\nlayer2=1 +3*layer1=1+12=13\n\nlayer3=1 +3*layer2=1+39=40\n\nlayer4=1 +3*layer3=1+120=121\n\nlayer5=1 +3*layer4=1+363=364\n\nlayer6=1 +3*layer5=1+1092=1093\n\nlayer7=1 +3*layer6=1+3279=3280\n\nlayer8=1 +3*layer7=1+9840=9841\n\nlayer9=1 +3*layer8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*layer9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that would be the correct answer.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I mistakenly included the outermost multiplication as a layer, leading to 1092, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me verify this again. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nL3 =1 +3*L2=1 +3*13=40\n\nL4=1 +3*L3=1+120=121\n\nL5=1 +3*L4=1 +363=364\n\nL6=1 +3*L5=1 +1092=1093\n\nL7=1 +3*L6=1 +3279=3280\n\nL8=1 +3*L7=1 +9840=9841\n\nL9=1 +3*L8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I thought I had ten layers, but actually, the outermost is just a multiplication by 3, not another (1 + 3(...)). So, the correct number of layers inside is nine, each being (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm by computing it step by step, layer by layer.\n\nCompute L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nCompute L2: 1 + 3*L1 =1 + 3*4=13\n\nCompute L3:1 +3*L2=1 +3*13=40\n\nCompute L4:1 +3*L3=1 +3*40=121\n\nCompute L5:1 +3*L4=1 +3*121=364\n\nCompute L6:1 +3*L5=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nCompute L7:1 +3*L6=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nCompute L8:1 +3*L7=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nCompute L9:1 +3*L8=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 1092, which was wrong because I included the outermost multiplication as a layer, but actually, it's just a single multiplication after the nine layers.\n\nSo, to make sure, let me compute it step by step again:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13\n\n3. Next:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\n4. Next:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\n5. Next:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought I had 10 layers, but actually, the outermost is just a multiplication, not another (1 + 3(...)). So, only nine layers inside, then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it in another way. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something like that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nSo, starting from L1=4, each subsequent layer is L(n)=1 +3*L(n-1).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The solution is L(n) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1\n\nSolving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n)=C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1)=4.\n\nSo, L(1)=C*3^1 + (-1/2)=3C -1/2=4\n\nSolving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid now. So, the key was to recognize the pattern, compute each layer step by step, and then use the closed-form formula to verify the result. This makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the inside and move outward, so that should help here.\n\nAlright, let's count how many layers of parentheses there are. Each time I see a \"1+3\", that's the innermost part, and then each layer adds another set of parentheses with a 3 multiplied in front. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the very inside: the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) is straightforward. 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, let's move one layer out.\n\nThe next layer is 3 multiplied by that result. So, the next expression is 3*(1 + 3). But wait, the innermost part we just computed is 4, so this becomes 3*4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12. So, that layer simplifies to 12.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 plus the result of the previous layer multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, let me write down the structure to make it clearer. The entire expression is a series of 1 + 3*(...), each time wrapping another layer. Let me try to represent each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me check that. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of times 1+3 appears, each time wrapped in another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3*(...), and each time we have another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3\" inside each other. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. ... and so on, until we reach the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nSo, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, maybe the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1).\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me create a table for clarity:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 times 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nI can compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n\n2 (the next digit) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it more carefully.\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8 \u2192 write 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 87572? Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, right?\n\nWait, no, maybe I missed a digit. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 total so far: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 total: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 total: 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 total: 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nAh, so I think I made a mistake in my earlier digit-by-digit calculation. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I thought it was 87572, but actually, it's 88572. So, the correct total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layer computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there, because if any of the layers were wrong, the final answer would be off.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the final answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer, used the formula to confirm the values, and even derived a general formula for the layers, which gives me confidence that the computations are correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. It seems like each part is a similar expression, just repeated multiple times. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(that result). So, let me write that down.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, this layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is again 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous was 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, this layer is 121.\n\nWait a minute, I think I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me check if that's consistent.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and looking back at the original problem, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of nesting. Let me confirm that.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each additional 3(...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of 3(...): \n\n1. 3(1+3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times because each layer adds another 3(...). So, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then 1+3*(1+3), and so on, 9 times. So, I think I may have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount. Each time I have a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2). So, up to layer 9, and then the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, in total, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer from 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by this Layer9.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer1 to Layer9:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Let me verify Layer9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer is growing by a factor of 3 and adding 1, so the numbers get big quickly. It's a geometric progression of sorts, but each time multiplied by 3 and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think of it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, but since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable to compute them one by one.\n\nThe recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By breaking it down step by step and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute each layer's value until I reached the outermost layer, which was then multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue with the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4.

Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nCompute L1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 13\n\nL3: 40\n\nL4: 121\n\nL5: 364\n\nL6: 1093\n\nL7: 3280\n\nL8: 9841\n\nL9: 29524\n\nWait, each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2? Let me check:\n\nFrom L1 to L2: 4 to 13. 3*4=12, 12+1=13.\n\nFrom L2 to L3: 13 to 40. 3*13=39, 39+1=40.\n\nFrom L3 to L4: 40 to 121. 3*40=120, 120+1=121.\n\nYes, so each layer is 3*previous +1.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it:\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the RHS is 1, let's assume L_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with L1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to find L9 without computing each layer, I could have used L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check the arithmetic again for the final multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 29524 as 29000 + 524.\n\n29000*3 = 87000\n\n524*3 = 1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost layer and work our way out. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost (L1) to the outermost (L9) as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\):\n   \\[ L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\]\n   \\[ L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\]\n\n3. The outermost expression is 3 times \\( L_9 \\):\n   \\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of problems.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the result of the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step I compute the innermost expression, then work my way out.\n\nLet me try to outline each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 4) = 3 * 5 = 15\n3. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 15) = 3 * 16 = 48\n4. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 48) = 3 * 49 = 147\n5. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 147) = 3 * 148 = 444\n6. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 444) = 3 * 445 = 1335\n7. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 1335) = 3 * 1336 = 4008\n8. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 4008) = 3 * 4009 = 12027\n9. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 12027) = 3 * 12028 = 36084\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3 * (1 + 36084) = 3 * 36085 = ?\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of steps. Let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of times 3(1+3(...)) occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(1+...). So, from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses: 9. So, there are 9 layers. Wait, but when I started counting earlier, I ended up with 10 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me look again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each 3(1 + ...) adds another layer. So, how many 3(1 + ...) are there?\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...)\n- So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nWait, let's count the number of 3's multiplied by (1 + ...). Each 3 is part of a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(1 + ...), that's a new layer. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, we have 9 instances of 3*(1 + ...). Wait, no, actually, the innermost is just (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9. Let me verify:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers? Because starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, but the outermost is the 10th. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression is 9 layers deep, meaning we compute from the innermost, which is 9 layers in, and then each step adds another layer. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so we compute 9 times.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1 + ...), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent 3(1 + ...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...) instances.\n\n1. The first 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost is just (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1 + ...) occur? Let's see:\n\n- The outermost is 3(1 + ...)\n- Inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n- Repeating until the innermost is (1 + 3)\n\nSo, from the outermost to the innermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses: Each 3(1 + ... starts a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a nested function. Each time, we have a function f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but wait, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recursive function. Let me define f(k) as the value of the expression with k layers.\n\nSo, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost layer is (1 + 3), which would be f(1) = 12. Then f(2) would be 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. f(3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120, and so on.\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 9 layers. So, f(9) would be the value.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 10 layers, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again, counting the number of 3*(1 + ...) instances.\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The outermost 3*(1 + ...)\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost is 3*(1 + 3).\n\nWait, but the innermost is actually (1 + 3), not 3*(1 + 3). So, perhaps the innermost is just (1 + 3), and then each layer outside is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers would be 9, because there are 9 sets of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the expression:\n\n- The first 3*(1 + ...) is the outermost one.\n- Then inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)\n- Repeating until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many 3*(1 + ...) are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. Inside that: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nAnd then the innermost is (1 + 3), so that's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, the total number of layers is 9.\n\nTherefore, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's compute step by step:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers, so after layer 9, we're done, right? But in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer 10, which might have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer. So, layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after layer 9, we have 36084. But wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which would be layer 10.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) is 9, meaning we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me think differently. Let me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me clarify: If f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then:\n\nf(1) = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nSo, according to this, f(9) = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step starting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, I got 36084 at layer 9. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the function. Let me check again.\n\nIf f(n) is the value of the expression with n layers, where each layer is 3*(1 + ...), then f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nBut in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 9 layers. So, perhaps the innermost is 3*(1 + 3), which would be f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nThen f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nAnd so on, up to f(9) = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I was starting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, which gave me a different result. So, perhaps the confusion is about whether the innermost is (1 + 3) or 3*(1 + 3).\n\nWait, in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), not 3*(1 + 3). So, perhaps f(n) should be defined differently.\n\nLet me redefine f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers, where each layer is 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*(36085) = 108255\n\nWait, that's different from the f(n) approach. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about how we define the layers. If the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the first layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, with 9 layers, we'd have:\n\nLayer 1: 15\n\nLayer 2: 48\n\nLayer 3: 147\n\nLayer 4: 444\n\nLayer 5: 1335\n\nLayer 6: 4008\n\nLayer 7: 12027\n\nLayer 8: 36084\n\nLayer 9: 108255\n\nSo, the total expression would be 108255.\n\nBut earlier, when I defined f(n) starting from f(1) = 12, I got f(9) = 88572.\n\nWait, so which approach is correct? Let's think about the structure.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nContinuing this way, up to 9 layers, which would be 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nSo, that would be the correct result.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed f(n) starting from f(1) = 12, I got a different result. So, perhaps the difference is in whether we count the innermost (1 + 3) as a layer or not.\n\nIn the first approach, I considered the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1, then each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) as layers 2 through 9, resulting in 108255.\n\nIn the second approach, I defined f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, and then built up from there, resulting in f(9) = 88572.\n\nBut in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), not 3*(1 + 3). So, perhaps the correct approach is the first one, where we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let's compute step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, but that's only 9 layers, ending at 36084. But the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which would be layer 10.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...), so layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4), layer 3 is 3*(1 + 15), and so on, up to layer 9, which is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which would correspond to layer 9. So, the total value is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed f(n) starting from f(1) = 12, I got f(9) = 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these two approaches.\n\nIn the first approach, starting from (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so after 9 layers, we have 36084.\n\nIn the second approach, defining f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) with f(1) = 12, we get f(9) = 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in the definition of f(n). If f(n) represents the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, then f(1) = 4 (the innermost (1 + 3)), then f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 15, and so on.\n\nBut in the second approach, I defined f(1) as 3*(1 + 3) = 12, which might not align with the original problem's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model it as f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(0) = 3.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nLet me define f(n) where n is the number of layers. Starting from f(0) = 3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo,\n\nf(0) = 3\n\nf(1) = 3*(1 + f(0)) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572\n\nSo, according to this, f(9) = 88572.\n\nBut in the first approach, starting from (1 + 3) = 4, and computing 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), I ended up with 36084.\n\nWait, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, in that case, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is 9, leading to 36084.\n\nBut in the f(n) approach, starting from f(0) = 3, f(9) = 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is in how we count the layers. If the innermost is (1 + 3), which is f(1) = 4, then f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 15, and so on, up to f(10) = 3*(1 + f(9)) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, that seems to align with the original expression, which has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, but the number of computations is 9, starting from (1 + 3).\n\nWait, but the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...), so layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, layer 3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to layer 9, which is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nBut the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so that would be layer 10.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each layer outside adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning we compute 9 times from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first part. Then, moving out, each 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + [3*(1 + 3)]))]))]))))])\n\nSo, each bracket represents a layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nLayer 10: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, meaning the outermost layer is layer 9, which is 36084.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer, so layer 9 would be the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which would be layer 9.\n\nSo, the value is 36084.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed f(n) starting from f(0) = 3, I got f(9) = 88572, which seems different.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is that in the f(n) approach, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, which is the first layer, but in the original expression, the first layer is (1 + 3) = 4, not 3*(1 + 3).\n\nSo, perhaps the f(n) approach is not aligned with the original problem's structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is to compute starting from (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so after 9 layers, we have 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check: If I compute 9 layers starting from (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, starting from (1 + 3) = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost layer is 108255.\n\nBut in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which would correspond to layer 9, so the total value is 108255.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought the number of layers was 9, but now it's 9 layers starting from (1 + 3), leading to the outermost layer being 108255.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how we count the layers. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 108255.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed f(n) starting from f(1) = 12, I got f(9) = 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the discrepancy is because in the f(n) approach, f(1) = 12, which is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but in the original problem, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, not 3*(1 + 3). So, perhaps the f(n) approach is not aligned with the original problem.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute starting from (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...), for a total of 9 layers, leading to 108255.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost, each 3*(1 + ...) is a new"

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay, so it's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a similar pattern: 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. Let's start from the innermost part and move outward. So, the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So, let's compute that.\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so that's 13. Moving out another level, we have another (1 + 3*(result from step 2)).\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems right.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Got it.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3 times 9841. Let me check that: 9841 * 3. Let's compute 9840 * 3 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524. Yep, that's correct.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524) = ?\n\n3 times 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, just compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 29524\n- Multiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to verify.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). That seems like a geometric series or something. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na_10 = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the same as before. Each step is building upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the process is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, it's another layer. So, in the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time we go out, it's another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, the number of such operations is 9.\n\nBut in our earlier step-by-step, we had a_1 to a_9, which gave us the result for the innermost to the outermost. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) =88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can directly compute the result without going through each step, which is more efficient.\n\nBut since the problem is given with 9 layers, I think it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach unless a formula is required.\n\nBut in any case, both methods lead to the same result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute the result step by step. Each layer follows the pattern of multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, that part becomes 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Wait, actually, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Let me see... Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me count the number of times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).

Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses. Let's see: the outermost is 3(...), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count them: 3(1+3(...)), that's one 3. Then inside, another 3(1+3(...)), so that's two. Continuing, I can see that there are nine 3s in total, each multiplying a (1 + ...). Wait, no, actually, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, perhaps? Wait, maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, up to E9, since there are nine layers. So, E1 is (1+3). Then E2 is 3*(1 + E1). E3 is 3*(1 + E2), and so on, up to E9, which is the outermost expression.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the problem again, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s. Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1+3)), then the next is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1+3))), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, perhaps? Let me try to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStarting with the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + E1). So, E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer out, E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nThen, E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers I have here. I started with E1 as the innermost, then went up to E9. But in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). Wait, but in my calculation, I ended up with E9 as the outermost, which would be the 9th layer. But in the problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a (1 + ...). Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nEach time, adding another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each time, the inner part is another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and each ... is another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then, each time, moving out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 indicates a new layer. Let's see: after the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...)) is a new layer. Let me count the number of times (1+3 appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s that are directly multiplying a (1 + ...). Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then, each time we move out, we add another layer.\n\nSo, in the expression, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) is another layer. So, layer 1: (1+3), layer 2: (1+3(1+3)), layer 3: (1+3(1+3(1+3))), and so on, up to layer 9: the outermost (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to E9 as 36084, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so perhaps I need to compute one more layer. Wait, no, because E9 was the outermost expression. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation, I started with E1 as the innermost (1+3) = 4, then E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 15, and so on, up to E9 = 36084. So, the outermost expression is E9, which is 36084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nSo, that's nine layers. Therefore, the value is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again to ensure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then, each time we move out, we add another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Each 3 is part of a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), and each ... is another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...). Let me count them.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (layer 1)\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (layer 2)\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (layer 3)\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (layer 4)\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (layer 5)\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (layer 6)\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 (layer 7)\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 (layer 8)\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 (layer 9)\n\nSo, that's nine layers, and the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again to make sure I didn't miscount. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's nine layers because each time we have another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1+3(...)) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The first opening parenthesis after 3 is for (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3(...)) - first layer\n2. (1+3(...)) - second layer\n3. (1+3(...)) - third layer\n4. (1+3(...)) - fourth layer\n5. (1+3(...)) - fifth layer\n6. (1+3(...)) - sixth layer\n7. (1+3(...)) - seventh layer\n8. (1+3(...)) - eighth layer\n9. (1+3(...)) - ninth layer\n\nSo, that's nine layers in total. Therefore, my earlier calculation of 36084 should be correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step, I'm adding 1 to the previous result and multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result).\n\nTherefore, after computing all nine layers, the final result is 36084.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I've double-checked the number of layers to ensure I didn't miscount. So, I'm confident that the solution is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating the innermost expression first and then substituting that result into the next outer layer, continuing this process until the entire expression is evaluated.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (E1):**\n   \\[\n   E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Layer (E2):**\n   \\[\n   E2 = 3 \\times (1 + E1) = 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Layer (E3):**\n   \\[\n   E3 = 3 \\times (1 + E2) = 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Layer (E4):**\n   \\[\n   E4 = 3 \\times (1 + E3) = 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Fifth Layer (E5):**\n   \\[\n   E5 = 3 \\times (1 + E4) = 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Sixth Layer (E6):**\n   \\[\n   E6 = 3 \\times (1 + E5) = 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Seventh Layer (E7):**\n   \\[\n   E7 = 3 \\times (1 + E6) = 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Eighth Layer (E8):**\n   \\[\n   E8 = 3 \\times (1 + E7) = 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (E9):**\n   \\[\n   E9 = 3 \\times (1 + E8) = 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can tackle this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, it's best to start from the inside and move outward, so that should help me avoid mistakes.\n\nAlright, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus something else. So, it's like a chain of 3s and 1s connected by addition and multiplication. Maybe if I evaluate each innermost part first, it'll simplify step by step.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost parentheses. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is (1 + 3) which equals 4. Now, I can replace that part in the expression. Let me rewrite the entire expression with that substitution:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))))\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me check. The innermost was the last (1 + 3), so replacing that with 4, so the expression before that was (1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, replacing that innermost part, I think I did it correctly.\n\nNow, moving one step out, the next innermost part is (1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Wait, no, actually, after replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next innermost part would be the one just outside that. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to number each level for clarity. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by (1 + something), so each layer adds another 3 and another (1 + ...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by something.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I replace a (1 + 3) with 4, then the next layer becomes 3*(1 + 4), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4)), and so on. So, perhaps there are nine layers here? Let me check.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n- Then, each subsequent 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, perhaps each layer adds another 3, so starting from the innermost, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to approach this systematically. Let me start from the innermost layer and compute each step, then substitute back into the next layer, and so on.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)). So, substituting Layer 1 = 4, we get:\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)):\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, Layer 2 was (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13, that's correct.\n\nThen Layer 3 is (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40, correct.\n\nProceeding to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093: Let me compute that again to be sure. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, 3279 +1=3280, correct.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, 3*3280: Let me compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let's compute that step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 *3 = 60000\n- 9000*3=27000\n- 500*3=1500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when I multiplied 3*29524, I think I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct? Let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but by taking it step by step and computing each layer one by one, I managed to get through it without making any mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested expressions. Let me see if I can figure this out. It seems like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied together, with each layer being added to the next. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let me write it down in a more manageable way. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So let's start there.\n\nFirst layer: (1 + 3) = 4. \n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, we add 1 to that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, maybe I should represent each step as:\n\nLet me define each layer step by step. Let's say each \"level\" is a separate computation. Starting from the innermost, which is level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 10: 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI notice there are nine sets of parentheses inside the initial 3(...). So, perhaps there are nine layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the first innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) +1 = 13\n3. 3*(13) +1 = 40\n4. 3*(40) +1 = 121\n5. 3*(121) +1 = 364\n6. 3*(364) +1 = 1093\n7. 3*(1093) +1 = 3280\n8. 3*(3280) +1 = 9841\n9. 3*(9841) +1 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had 10 levels, but maybe it's only 9 layers because the outermost is just multiplied by 3 without adding 1. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and this repeats 9 times, and then the outermost is 3*(result). So, I think I have 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did 10 levels, I got 88572, but perhaps that's correct because the outermost is just multiplying by 3. So, maybe the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Let me go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nStarting with 29524 *3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3 = 60000\n\n9000 *3 = 27000\n\n500 *3 = 1500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each step manually. Maybe a geometric series or something?\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nLet me define a_n as the nth term, starting from the innermost.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I also get 88572, which confirms my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer step by step, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each part one by one without getting confused.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result we just got, which is 4. So, the next step is:\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*4):\n   First, compute 3*4 = 12\n   Then, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so now that part simplifies to 13. Let's move another level out.\n\n3. Compute (1 + 3*13):\n   First, 3*13 = 39\n   Then, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOkay, so now we have 40. Moving out another layer.\n\n4. Compute (1 + 3*40):\n   3*40 = 120\n   1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 121. Let's keep going.\n\n5. Compute (1 + 3*121):\n   3*121 = 363\n   1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, that's a bigger number. Let me make sure I did that right. 3 times 121 is indeed 363, and adding 1 gives 364. Okay, moving on.\n\n6. Compute (1 + 3*364):\n   3*364 = 1092\n   1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, that's getting large quickly. Let me check my multiplication: 3 times 364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Yep, that's correct. So, 1093 is right.\n\nContinuing outward.\n\n7. Compute (1 + 3*1093):\n   3*1093 = Let's compute that step by step. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n   Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nHmm, 3280. Let me confirm the multiplication: 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Yes, that's correct. So, 3279 +1=3280.\n\nNext layer.\n\n8. Compute (1 + 3*3280):\n   First, 3*3280. Let's break it down: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840.\n   Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Let me double-check the multiplication. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Yes, correct. So, 9840 +1=9841.\n\nMoving out another step.\n\n9. Compute (1 + 3*9841):\n   Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523.\n   Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, let me check that again. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Compute 3*(result from step 9):\n    So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off.

So that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4\n2. Next: (1 +3*4)=13\n3. Next: (1 +3*13)=40\n4. Next: (1 +3*40)=121\n5. Next: (1 +3*121)=364\n6. Next: (1 +3*364)=1093\n7. Next: (1 +3*1093)=3280\n8. Next: (1 +3*3280)=9841\n9. Next: (1 +3*9841)=29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's 10 steps, which makes sense because there are 9 sets of parentheses, each adding a layer, and the outermost multiplication by 3. So, 10 steps in total.\n\nLet me just verify each step again quickly to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nWait a second, though. Let me think about whether there's a pattern here or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each step manually. Sometimes, with nested expressions like this, especially with repeated multiplication and addition, there might be a geometric series or some recursive formula that can simplify the calculation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each step as a term in a sequence, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a\u2089, since there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, in general, a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\na\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the innermost is a\u2081, then a\u2082, up to a\u2089.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, after computing a\u2089, we have to multiply by 3, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(a\u2089).\n\nSo, let's compute a\u2089 first using the formula:\n\na\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2\n\nBecause n=9, so a\u2089 = (3^(9+1) -1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^10 = 59049\n\nThen, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute a\u2089 directly without going through each step, which would be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since we had only 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case the number increases.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, and then using the formula for the sum of a geometric series could also be a way to approach this.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a linear recurrence, the formula we derived is more straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with 9 layers, each of the form (1 + 3*(previous layer)). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we arrived at the final result of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, by recognizing the pattern and deriving a closed-form formula, we could compute the result more efficiently, especially useful for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut either way, the answer is the same: 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4.

Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost multiplication:\n\n10. Compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). So I'll compute that first.\n\nSo, (1+3) is 4. Got that. Now, moving one level out, the next parentheses is 1+3( ... ). Since we just computed the innermost part, let's substitute that in.\n\nWait, let me write this down step by step so I don't get confused.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next level: (1 + 3(4))\n3. Then: (1 + 3(result from step 2))\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost parentheses.\n\nWait, that might take a while, but let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me label each step as Step 1, Step 2, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving out one level, we have:\n\nStep 2: Compute (1 + 3*(result from Step 1)) = 1 + 3*4\n\nSo, 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Now, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 2)) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next level out: (1 + 3*(result from Step 3)) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Moving out another level: (1 + 3*(result from Step 4)) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Next level: (1 + 3*(result from Step 5)) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Another level out: (1 + 3*(result from Step 6)) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Moving out another level: (1 + 3*(result from Step 7)) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Next level: (1 + 3*(result from Step 8)) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost level: 3*(result from Step 9) = 3*29524\n\nNow, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo yes, that gives 88572.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1+3=4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nStep 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nStep 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nStep 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and the multiplication and addition look correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive pattern, but since it's only nine levels deep, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach, even if it's a bit tedious.\n\nWait, let me think if there's a pattern here that could simplify the calculation. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). So it's like each step is a function of the previous one: a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with the innermost being a(1) = 4.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the innermost is (1+3)=4, which is a(1)=4.\n\nThen a(2) = 1 + 3*a(1) = 1 + 3*4=13.\n\na(3)=1 + 3*a(2)=1 +3*13=40.\n\na(4)=1 +3*40=121.\n\na(5)=1 +3*121=364.\n\na(6)=1 +3*364=1093.\n\na(7)=1 +3*1093=3280.\n\na(8)=1 +3*3280=9841.\n\na(9)=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen the final step is 3*a(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Each step is indeed following the recurrence relation a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1)=4.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to find a closed-form formula for a(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, with a(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a(n) = 3*a(n-1). The solution to this is a_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a(n) = a_h(n) + a_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can factor out 1/2: a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for n=9, a(9)=29524, which is what we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 once again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). Let me try to parse this from the inside out because that's usually how you tackle nested expressions.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: the first expression is 1+3. Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above).

So, each time, we take the result from the innermost expression, multiply it by 3, add 1, and then use that result in the next layer.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should approach this more systematically.

The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1+3(...). Let's see, how many times does 1+3 occur?

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2.

Hmm, that's a bit different than I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). So, I think I need to compute L1 to L9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had L1:4, L2:13, L3:40, L4:121, etc. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write each step clearly.\n\nLet me start over.\n\nCompute:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute each layer:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,000 * 3 = 87,000\n\n524 * 3 = 1,572\n\nSo, total is 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer computation step by step because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides: -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1 (innermost):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nCompute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nAlright, let me try to parse this. It seems like a nested expression where each layer is of the form 3 times something. Each \"something\" is (1 + 3 times another similar expression). So, starting from the innermost part, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next level. \n\nLet me write this out to visualize it better. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(result from above)). So, substituting the result, it becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now we have 13. Moving out another level, we again have (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting 13 in, it becomes (1 + 3*13).\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, 40. Let me note that down. Now, moving another level out, same pattern: (1 + 3*(previous result)), which is now (1 + 3*40).\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nAlright, 121. Continuing outward, next layer is (1 + 3*121).\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n364. Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*364).\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n1093. Now, next layer is (1 + 3*1093).\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n3280. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280).\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9841. Moving outward, next is (1 + 3*9841).\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n29524. Now, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*29524).\n\n10. Next level: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) )\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times we've done this.\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4 (1st layer)\n2. 1+3*4=13 (2nd layer)\n3. 1+3*13=40 (3rd layer)\n4. 1+3*40=121 (4th layer)\n5. 1+3*121=364 (5th layer)\n6. 1+3*364=1093 (6th layer)\n7. 1+3*1093=3280 (7th layer)\n8. 1+3*3280=9841 (8th layer)\n9. 1+3*9841=29524 (9th layer)\n10. 1+3*29524=88573 (10th layer)\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at it: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...). \n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer is another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9. Wait, but when I computed above, I went up to the 10th layer, which gave me 88573. But maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount. Let's list each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: (1+3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1+3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1+3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1+3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1+3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the outermost multiplication. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to 88573, which is incorrect because I mistakenly included an extra layer. So, let me correct that.\n\nLet me recount without the extra layer:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*4) = 13\n3. (1+3*13) = 40\n4. (1+3*40) = 121\n5. (1+3*121) = 364\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000, but wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, actually, it's better to compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the steps, I mistakenly went up to 88573 because I thought there was a 10th layer, but actually, the expression only has 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the correct computation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nLet me verify this by another method, perhaps looking for a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes this time, I hope. Let me just quickly recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Compute from the innermost outwards, step by step.\n3. Alternatively, model it as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution.\n4. Both methods led to the same result, so confident it's correct.\n\nYeah, I think that's thorough enough.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, we can model it using a recurrence relation and derive a closed-form solution to find the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Each layer seems to follow a pattern where it's 1 plus 3 times something. Let me try to parse this.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards might be the best approach here. That way, I can compute each part step by step without getting lost in the complexity.\n\nLet me write down the expression more clearly, maybe numbering each layer for clarity. So, starting from the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCalculating 3*4 gives 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364, let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Calculating each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

I think the key here is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems like a common strategy for dealing with nested expressions. So, I'll start by identifying the innermost part and then compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI notice that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times something. So, maybe each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, then\n2. The next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1),\n3. Then the next is 1 + 3*(result from step 2),\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me count how many times this happens. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so maybe there are eight layers of multiplication by 3. Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n9. Finally, the outermost 3*(...) is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try a different approach. Let me represent each layer as a level, starting from the innermost as level 1, then building up each level step by step.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but let me check how many levels there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions:\n\nFrom the innermost, each step adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer, which would be 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I went up to Level 9 as 1 + 3*(Level 8). But perhaps the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, each starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me try again, perhaps more carefully.\n\nLet me parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the innermost is:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524).\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nCalculating that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, that's not the way.

But just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few more steps or check if there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive formula.\n\nWait, each level is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4.\n\nWait, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL(4) = 1 + 3*L(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nYes, so each level is 1 + 3 times the previous level.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved in general.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find C, we can consider the steady-state solution when L(n) = L(n-1) = C.\n\nSo, C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check if that formula works with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works perfectly. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of computation, but using the formula, it's much faster. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've considered all the layers correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer out adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, perhaps I can determine how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer, which would be 1 + 3(1 + 3(...8 times...)).\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), each time building on the previous one. Therefore, n=9 in our formula.\n\nTherefore, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the outermost expression is indeed 3*(L(9)).\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(...), where ... is the 9th layer, which is L(9) = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few more layers manually using the formula.\n\nFor example, L(1) = 4.\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2:\n\nFor n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just check if I've made any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nWow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) \n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake there. Let me count the number of parentheses correctly. Each time I replace an innermost (1+3), I should move outward one level. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) \n\nWait, that's still a bit confusing. Let me write it down step by step, maybe numbering each level.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as levels 1 through 9. So, each level corresponds to one (1 + 3) computation.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1 result)) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2 result)) = (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*(Level 3 result)) = (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*(Level 4 result)) = (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*(Level 5 result)) = (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*(Level 6 result)) = (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*(Level 7 result)) = (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8 result)) = (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the entire expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Level 9, which gives 29524, we then multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you have multiple levels, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the levels. Let me recount.\n\nStarting again:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many levels are there? Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error in any step. Let me verify each step again.\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before, so maybe it's correct. But I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, each level can be expressed recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can find another equation by considering the next term. Let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSo, a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substituting A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2)\n\nSo, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nSince we have 9 levels, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of levels. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, each subsequent one adds another level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\nAfter 3(, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier counting, I considered 9 levels, which would correspond to 3^10. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 levels, which would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ), which is 3*(29524) =88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each level is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result). After 9 levels, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Compute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how many layers there are. I'll start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, just like how you solve parentheses in arithmetic expressions. So, the innermost part is (1+3), right? Let me check: starting from the inside, each layer adds 1 and 3, then multiplies by 3, and that result is used in the next outer layer.\n\nSo, let me count the number of (1+3) terms. Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) = 4.\n2. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of step 1).\n3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of step 2).\n4. This continues until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3(...). Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time it's 3*(1 + ...). So, if I start from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 3*(40) = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 3*(121) = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 3*(364) = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 3*(1093) = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 3*(3280) = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 3*(9841) = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 3*(29524) = 88572, then 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so maybe I miscounted. Let me try to write it down step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers, so E9 is the innermost, and the outermost would be 3*E9.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers of 1+3(...). So perhaps E1 is the innermost, and the outermost is E9, so the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had E1 to E9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 4. So, according to that, the final result would be 3*E9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me see:\n\nIf E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9, which would be 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first thought, I had 10 steps, but maybe that was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times I apply the 3*(1 + ...) operation.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a step, so starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3*(previous result). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first innermost.\n\nThen each next layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3*\" occur? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\".\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. (1 + 3*(...))\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. (1 + 3*(...))\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 times \"1 + 3*\". So, each time, we're building up the expression from the inside out, 9 layers.\n\nSo, each E1 to E9, as I defined earlier, would be each of these layers. So, E1 is the innermost, E2 is the next, up to E9, which is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, as I calculated earlier:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting, I thought I had 10 steps, but now I see it's 9 layers, so 9 E's, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me write down each step clearly:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n1. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9, so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in each step.\n\nLet me go through each E step again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression to avoid computing each step manually, but since it's only 9 layers, it's manageable. Let me think if there's a formula for a nested expression of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) n times.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving E_n + c = 3*(E_{n-1} + c)\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to find the closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is E^{(h)}_n = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E^{(p)}_n = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB - 3*B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nE_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: E_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: E_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: E_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: E_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: E_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the steps I computed earlier. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it as (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem has 9 layers, n=9, so E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then the total expression is 3*E_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly applying the operation 1 + 3*(previous result) and then multiplying the final result by 3.

It seems like each part repeats the same structure: 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). I think I can approach this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me try to rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let's denote each layer as a separate part. Starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me list the layers from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine layers in total because each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 times a nested expression, and there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 times (1 plus another 3 times something). So, how many layers are there?

This continues until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, starting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3 * L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3 * L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer's computation:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3 * L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3 * L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3 * L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3 * L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3 * L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3 * L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3 * L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3 * L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(L9). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which we just calculated as 29524.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 * L9, which is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet's compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n2. The next is inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. So, each time, it's a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...))\n- Continuing until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, it's another layer. So, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed L1 to L9, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I have nine layers or eight. Because sometimes when you count the layers, you might miscount.\n\nLet me write the expression again, but with each layer numbered:\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nSo, that's nine layers, from L1 to L9.\n\nTherefore, the computation I did earlier is correct, with L9 being 29524, and the total expression being 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, L9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(a-1), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences.\n\nFor a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nBut in our case, the first term is L1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1.\n\nWait, maybe I should adjust the indices.\n\nLet me define L_0 as the initial term. Let's see, if n=1, L1=4, n=2, L2=13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from n=0.\n\nLet me try to model it as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, our first layer is L1=4, which is when n=1.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. Each step seems correct, and the alternative method using the recurrence relation gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), and the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. By systematically computing each layer, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)})\\).

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. I think I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me try to visualize this. Each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times something, and then all of that is multiplied by 3 again. It seems like a recursive pattern, maybe something that could be simplified with a formula or a pattern.\n\nLet me write down the expression more clearly, starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(that result). So, it's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. \n\nWait, so each time we go out a level, we're taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me make a table or something to keep track of each step. Maybe that will help me avoid confusion.\n\nLet's define each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So starting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after Level 9, the innermost expression is 29524. But then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 3*20 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nFinally, 3*4 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, right? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 times 3: Let's compute it digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7 and carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, so the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Level 9.\n\nWait, let's go back through each level to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nWait, so 3*9841 is 29523, not 29524 as I thought earlier. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 *3 again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each level step by step. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out. It seems like each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nFirst layer (innermost):\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each outer layer is 1 + 3*(inner result). So let me try again.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved as such. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the initial layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 * 3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the formula approach also gives the same result, so I'm confident.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost outwards, recognizing a pattern that allows the use of a recurrence relation formula. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to the closed-form solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For 9 layers, this results in 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Compute \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, that's a lot of nested expressions. Let me try to parse it. It seems like each layer is of the form 3 times (1 plus 3 times something). So it's a series of these expressions nested inside each other. Let me see how many layers there are. I'll count the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So nine layers in total. That means I need to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards.\n\nLet me write this down more systematically. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So starting from the inside:\n\nL1: 1+3\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(result of L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(result of L2)\n\nAnd so on, up to L9. So I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1.\n\nLet me compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to L2: 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, L2 is 13.\n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nGot it, L3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo L4 is 121.\n\nNow, L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL5 is 364.\n\nNext, L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSo L6 is 1093.\n\nProceeding to L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL7 is 3280.\n\nThen, L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that seems off. Let me double-check that last step. Because the original problem is 3 times the result of L9, not 1 + 3*(L8). Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(result of L9). So perhaps I made a mistake in the last step.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the entire expression is 3*(the last layer). So maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the innermost as L1, then build up each layer, and then multiply the final result by 3. So let me recount:\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9, I thought that was the innermost, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So perhaps I should compute up to L9 as 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought L9 was 29524, so the total would be 3*29524 = 88572. But I'm a bit confused because when I computed L9 as 29524, that was 1 + 3*L8, which is correct. So the outermost layer is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, after computing all the inner layers up to L9, which is 29524, the outermost operation is 3*29524. So 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm each step because I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to the form of a geometric progression. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So the innermost layers compute to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, 3 times a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSo that confirms the result.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3... Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). So how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). So the number of layers is 9, because the expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So when I computed up to a_9, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify with n=9, a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer.\n\nAs we saw, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nSo the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as a sum.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So expanding this, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nBut that's more complicated. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{10} directly.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo 3^{10}=59049\n\nThen a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{11} since the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways. The answer should be 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using another approach.\n\nLet me consider the expression as a sum of terms.\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(something). Let me try to express this as a sum.\n\nLet me denote S = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...))\n\nWith 9 layers inside.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as S = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but it's not a simple sum. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote E9 = 1 + 3\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8\n\n...\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*E1\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum.\n\nWait, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAs we saw earlier, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen total expression is 3*E9 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using binary exponentiation or another method, but I think the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation have confirmed the result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. We compute each layer from the innermost outward, then multiply the final result by 3.\n\n1. Compute innermost layer:\n   L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   L2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n   L3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n   L4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n   L5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n   L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n   L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n   L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n   L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the final layer by 3:\n   Total = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
