    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that part simplifies to 4. Then, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me calculate that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So now, that part simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression would be 1 plus 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: that's 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 40. So now, that part is 40.\n\nNext level out, it's again 1 plus 3 times the previous result, which is 40. So, 1 + 3*40. Calculating that, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that simplifies to 121.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next expression is 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, that part is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext level out, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nContinuing, the next expression is 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the expression is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that multiplication again because 29524*3. Let me do it digit by digit to be sure. 29524 multiplied by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*88573: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Actually, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding all these together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. So, that's 265720.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication another way. 88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 is 9.\n\n3*7 is 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 is 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 is 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\n3*0 is 0, plus 2 is 2, but wait, actually, the number is 88573, so after the first 8, there's another 8, then 5, 7, 3. Wait, maybe I should write it down:\n\n88573\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n\n3*0 (since there's no more digits, but wait, 88573 is five digits, so after the second 8, there's nothing else, so 3*0 is 0, but we have the carryover 2, so write 2.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 3*3 = 9\n\n- Tens place: 3*7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n- Hundreds place: 3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n- Thousands place: 3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2\n\n- Since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, putting it together: 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, the expression is 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute that. 3*265720: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60, and 0*3 is 0. Wait, but 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So, 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding them all together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161. So, that's 797161.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way. 265720 * 3:\n\n265720\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3 = 0\n\n2*3 = 6\n\n7*3 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1\n\n6*3 = 18 + 1 = 19, write 9, carry 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, writing it out: 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this outermost result, which is 797161. So, the final step is to compute 3*797161. Let me calculate that.\n\n3*700000 = 2,100,000\n\n3*90,000 = 270,000\n\n3*7,000 = 21,000\n\n3*100 = 300\n\n3*60 = 180\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nWait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Actually, 797,161 is 700,000 + 90,000 + 7,000 + 100 + 60 + 1. So, 3*(700,000 + 90,000 + 7,000 + 100 + 60 + 1) = 3*700,000 + 3*90,000 + 3*7,000 + 3*100 + 3*60 + 3*1.\n\nCalculating each:\n\n3*700,000 = 2,100,000\n\n3*90,000 = 270,000\n\n3*7,000 = 21,000\n\n3*100 = 300\n\n3*60 = 180\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161 = 2,391,483.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication another way to be sure. 797,161 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n6*3 = 18, write 8, carry 1\n\n1*3 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n7*3 = 21, write 1, carry 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write 9, carry 2\n\n7*3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write 3, carry 2\n\nThere's a comma here, but in reality, it's 797,161, so the digits are 7,9,7,1,6,1.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out:\n\n797,161\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n6*3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n\n1*3 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n\n7*3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carry over 2\n\nSince there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo, putting it together: 2,391,483. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step builds up the next number, and finally, we end up with 3 multiplied by 797,161, which equals 2,391,483.\n\nWait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The original expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), and each time, I computed the innermost one first and worked my way out. Each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, 265720, and finally 797161. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 2,391,483. That seems consistent.\n\nI think I followed the correct approach by simplifying the innermost parentheses first and then moving outward. Each time, I computed the value inside the parentheses and then multiplied by 3, adding 1 as needed. It's a repetitive process, but each step builds on the previous one, so as long as each individual multiplication and addition is correct, the final result should be accurate.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each step checks out when I verify it, so I'm confident that the final answer is 2,391,483.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that simplifies step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner expression. Following this method, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{2391483}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse it step by step. Let me write it out again to visualize better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times that expression. Let me start by computing the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's denote each layer as follows to keep track: Let me number the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), and each time it's a 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, perhaps the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) And so on until Layer 9, which would be the outermost layer. Wait, but let's count how many layers there are. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Hmm, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s: The first 3 is at the very beginning, then each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. So, perhaps there are 9 layers in total. Wait, maybe I should just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That's Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Wait, let me clarify. Let me think of each layer as being of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, but in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps I should model it as each layer being 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, maybe I need to define it differently. Let me try again. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let me start from the innermost expression and work my way out. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, let's define Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. So, putting it together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me verify that multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that seems to confirm that the answer is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

    "text": " Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards, simplifying each layer as I go. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out is 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I understand the structure correctly. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's 4. Then moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So that layer is 40. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So that layer is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's 364. Next, 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So that's 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that. 3*1093 is... Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, and 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So that layer is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's see, 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So that's 9841.\n\nThen, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So that layer is 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9524*3 is... Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 524*3=1572. So 27000 + 1572 = 28572. Adding that to 60000 gives 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Adding 1 gives 88573. So that layer is 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8573*3 is... Let's see, 8000*3=24000, 573*3=1719. So 24000 + 1719 = 25719. Adding that to 240000 gives 240000 + 25719 = 265719. Adding 1 gives 265720. So that layer is 265720.\n\nWait, let me check that again because that seems quite large. Let me verify 3*88573. 88573 times 3: 3*3 is 9, carry over 0. 7*3 is 21, carry over 2. 5*3 is 15 plus 2 is 17, carry over 1. 8*3 is 24 plus 1 is 25, carry over 2. 8*3 is 24 plus 2 is 26. So the product is 265719, and adding 1 gives 265720. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that. 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 65720*3=197160. Adding those together: 600000 + 197160 = 797160. Adding 1 gives 797161. So that layer is 797161.\n\nWait, that seems too big. Let me check that again. 3*265720: 265,720 * 3. Let me compute it step by step. 200,000 *3=600,000. 60,000*3=180,000. 5,000*3=15,000. 700*3=2,100. 20*3=60. Adding all together: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000. 780,000 +15,000=795,000. 795,000 + 2,100=797,100. 797,100 + 60=797,160. Then add 1: 797,160 +1=797,161. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute that. 3*797,161. Hmm, 700,000*3=2,100,000. 97,161*3: 90,000*3=270,000. 7,000*3=21,000. 161*3=483. Adding those: 270,000 +21,000=291,000. 291,000 +483=291,483. Now, adding that to 2,100,000: 2,100,000 + 291,483=2,391,483. Adding 1 gives 2,391,484. So that layer is 2,391,484.\n\nWait, that seems really big. Let me confirm. 797,161 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n797,161\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n2,391,483\n\nYes, that's correct. So adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(2,391,484). Let me compute that. 3*2,391,484. Let me break it down: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000. 391,484*3: Let's compute 300,000*3=900,000. 91,484*3: 90,000*3=270,000. 1,484*3=4,452. So adding those: 270,000 + 4,452=274,452. Then 900,000 + 274,452=1,174,452. Now, adding that to 6,000,000 gives 6,000,000 +1,174,452=7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify:\n\n2,391,484 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n8 \u00d7 3 =24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n4 \u00d73=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over1.\n1 \u00d73=3 +1=4, write down 4.\n9 \u00d73=27, write down7, carry over2.\n3 \u00d73=9 +2=11, write down1, carry over1.\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo the product is 7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*(7,174,453). Let me compute that. 3*7,174,453. Let me compute this step by step.\n\n7,000,000 \u00d73=21,000,000.\n174,453 \u00d73: 100,000\u00d73=300,000. 70,000\u00d73=210,000. 4,000\u00d73=12,000. 453\u00d73=1,359.\n\nAdding those together: 300,000 +210,000=510,000. 510,000 +12,000=522,000. 522,000 +1,359=523,359.\n\nNow, adding that to 21,000,000: 21,000,000 +523,359=21,523,359. Adding 1 gives 21,523,360.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check:\n\n7,174,453 \u00d73:\n\n3\u00d73=9\n5\u00d73=15, carry over1.\n4\u00d73=12 +1=13, carry over1.\n4\u00d73=12 +1=13, carry over1.\n7\u00d73=21 +1=22, carry over2.\n1\u00d73=3 +2=5.\n,1\u00d73=3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it out properly:\n\n7,174,453\n\u00d7          3\n------------\n21,523,359\n\nYes, that's correct. Then adding 1 gives 21,523,360.\n\nWait, no, wait. The expression is 1 + 3*(7,174,453) which is 21,523,359 +1=21,523,360.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*(21,523,360). Let me compute that. 3*21,523,360. Let me break it down.\n\n20,000,000 \u00d73=60,000,000.\n1,523,360 \u00d73: 1,000,000\u00d73=3,000,000. 523,360\u00d73: 500,000\u00d73=1,500,000. 23,360\u00d73=69,  (Wait, 23,360 \u00d73: 20,000\u00d73=60,000, 3,360\u00d73=10,080. So 60,000 +10,080=70,080.)\n\nWait, maybe a better way: 21,523,360 \u00d73.\n\nLet me compute 21,523,360 \u00d73:\n\n21,523,360 \u00d73:\n\n0\u00d73=0\n6\u00d73=18, write down 8, carry over1.\n3\u00d73=9 +1=10, write down 0, carry over1.\n3\u00d73=9 +1=10, write down 0, carry over1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down5, carry over1.\n1\u00d73=3 +1=4.\n5\u00d73=15, write down5, carry over1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n21,523,360\n\u00d7          3\n------------\n64,569,  80?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute it properly.\n\n21,523,360 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n0\u00d73=0\n6\u00d73=18, write 8, carry over1.\n3\u00d73=9 +1=10, write 0, carry over1.\n3\u00d73=9 +1=10, write 0, carry over1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry over1.\n1\u00d73=3 +1=4.\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry over1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 64,569, 080? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, 21,523,360 \u00d73:\n\n21,523,360\n\u00d7          3\n------------\n64,569, 080\n\nWait, that can't be right because 20,000,000 \u00d73 is 60,000,000, and 1,523,360 \u00d73 is 4,570,080. So total is 60,000,000 +4,570,080=64,570,080. Then adding 1 gives 64,570,081.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the previous step.\n\nWait, let's recalculate 21,523,360 \u00d73:\n\n21,523,360 \u00d73:\n\n21,523,360 \u00d73:\n\n21,000,000 \u00d73 =63,000,000\n\n523,360 \u00d73: 500,000\u00d73=1,500,000; 23,360\u00d73=70,080. So total is 1,500,000 +70,080=1,570,080.\n\nAdding to 63,000,000: 63,000,000 +1,570,080=64,570,080.\n\nSo, 3\u00d721,523,360=64,570,080. Then adding 1 gives 64,570,081.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 21,523,360 \u00d73=64,569,080. That was a mistake. It's actually 64,570,080, right? Because 21,523,360 \u00d73 is 64,570,080. Then adding 1 is 64,570,081.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 64,569,080, which is incorrect. So the correct value is 64,570,080 +1=64,570,081.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*(64,570,081). Let me compute that. 3\u00d764,570,081. Let me compute this:\n\n64,570,081 \u00d73:\n\n60,000,000 \u00d73=180,000,000\n\n4,570,081 \u00d73: 4,000,000\u00d73=12,000,000; 570,081\u00d73=1,710,243.\n\nAdding those together: 12,000,000 +1,710,243=13,710,243.\n\nAdding to 180,000,000: 180,000,000 +13,710,243=193,710,243.\n\nAdding 1 gives 193,710,244.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 64,570,081 \u00d73:\n\n64,570,081 \u00d73:\n\n60,000,000\u00d73=180,000,000\n\n4,570,081\u00d73=13,710,243.\n\nSo total is 180,000,000 +13,710,243=193,710,243. Then add 1: 193,710,244.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*(193,710,244). Let me compute that. 3\u00d7193,710,244.\n\n193,710,244 \u00d73:\n\n100,000,000\u00d73=300,000,000\n\n93,710,244\u00d73: 90,000,000\u00d73=270,000,000; 3,710,244\u00d73=11,130,732.\n\nAdding those: 270,000,000 +11,130,732=281,130,732.\n\nAdding to 300,000,000: 300,000,000 +281,130,732=581,130,732.\n\nAdding 1 gives 581,130,733.\n\nWait, that seems correct.

Then adding 1 gives 581,130,733.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check with another method. 193,710,244 \u00d73:\n\n193,710,244 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute 200,000,000\u00d73=600,000,000, subtract 6,289,756\u00d73=18,869,268. So 600,000,000 -18,869,268=581,130,732. Then adding 1 gives 581,130,733.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*(581,130,733).

Adding 1 gives 5,230,176,601.\n\nWait, but wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So after all those layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 would be 3*(result of the innermost expression). But in my calculation, I went all the way to 5,230,176,601, but perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the first (1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each subsequent layer adds another. So how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3 terms: Let me see, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 1+3, so let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Let me count:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, in total, we have 9 layers. So, perhaps I went too far in my calculation earlier, going beyond 9 layers.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me recount how many layers I've computed so far.\n\nI started from the innermost (1+3) as layer 1, then each subsequent layer is one more. So, if there are 9 layers, I should compute up to layer 9. Let me check my earlier steps.\n\nWait, in my initial approach, I started from the innermost as layer 1, then each layer outwards is layer 2, 3, etc., up to layer 9, which would be the outermost before the initial 3. So, perhaps I went beyond that.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers earlier. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) instances.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each (1+3( starts a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Therefore, the innermost is (1+3), then 8 more layers, totaling 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, in my earlier calculation, I went beyond layer 9, which was a mistake. So, I should stop at layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the correct computation is:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems much more manageable. So, perhaps I overcomplicated it earlier by going beyond 9 layers. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\nCompute layer by layer:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier I miscounted the number of layers, leading me to compute beyond the required layers, which made the numbers unnecessarily large. So, by carefully counting the layers and stopping at layer 9, I arrive at the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of (1 + 3(...)). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another similar expression). So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(previous), and this repeats. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Hmm, so starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3*(that), then another, and so on. Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each time we add another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, then moving outward, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me try to count how many times 1+3 is used. Let's see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent 1+3 is the next layer. Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we go outward, we have another 1+3. Let me count them: 1+3 is the first, then 1+3*(1+3) is the second, then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)) is the third, and so on. Let me see how many layers there are. Let's see: the expression has 8 opening parentheses after the first 3, so that would mean there are 8 layers? Wait, let me check that again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. The first 3 is outside, then inside each parenthesis, there's another 3. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside, another 3, then another, and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, there are 8 layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). Wait, but the innermost part is 1+3, so that's the first layer, then each time we go outward, we add another 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 8, meaning we have 8 instances of 1+3 multiplied by something. Let me confirm that. Let's break it down:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 8: 1+3*(Layer 7)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8). So, I think that's correct. So, the problem is to compute 3*(Layer 8), where each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, Layer 1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 8, which is the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nSo, to compute this, I think I can start from the innermost layer and work my way outward, computing each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L8 = 1 + 3*L7\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L8\n\nSo, if I compute L1 through L8 step by step, I can find the value.\n\nLet me start computing each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. L2 is 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL3 is 40.\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL4 is 121.\n\nContinuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL5 is 364.\n\nNext, L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL6 is 1093.\n\nThen, L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL7 is 3280.\n\nFinally, L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, L8 is 9841.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L8, so 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*9841.\n\nWell, 3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*800 = 2400\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nAdding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when doing multiple steps, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLet me verify each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29,523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions, but since I've already computed it step by step and verified each layer, I think 29,523 is the correct answer.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the result without computing each layer. Let me think about that for a moment. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers. So, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, the recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our computation, E1 was 4, E2 was 13, and so on. So, if we have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4, then E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, that's the same as before.\n\nNow, solving the recurrence relation E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: E1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check it with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the general formula is E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 8 layers, so n=8.\n\nThus, E8 = (3^{9} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, E8 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, E8 = 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29,523, as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nBut since the problem only had 8 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but for a larger number of layers, the formula would be more efficient.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only 8 layers, both methods work fine.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 29,523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by computing each nested layer starting from the innermost part.\n\n1. Define each layer as follows:\n   - \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_8\\):\n   - \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{29523}\\)."

So, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but hold on, that doesn't seem right because L2 would be 3*(1 + L1), but L1 is (1 + 3) = 4, so 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, L3 would be 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me check: if L1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, correct.\n\nThen, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me recount because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 L1\n2. 3*(1 + L1) \u2192 L2\n3. 3*(1 + L2) \u2192 L3\n4. 3*(1 + L3) \u2192 L4\n5. 3*(1 + L4) \u2192 L5\n6. 3*(1 + L5) \u2192 L6\n7. 3*(1 + L6) \u2192 L7\n8. 3*(1 + L7) \u2192 L8\n9. 3*(1 + L8) \u2192 L9\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9, I got 36084, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the inner expression. So, the total value would be 3*(L9), which would be 3*36084 = 108252. But wait, that seems too high. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try again, more carefully. Let me write out the expression step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Let's call this L1.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2192 L2.\n\nNext layer out: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2192 L3.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2192 L4.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2192 L5.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2192 L6.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2192 L7.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2192 L8.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2192 L9.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...), where ... is L9.\n\nSo, total value = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check my calculations again, because maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers or in the computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3( sequences. Each time it's 3(1+3(, which is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first 3(1+3( is the outermost layer.\n- Then inside that, another 3(1+3(, which is the second layer.\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is (1+3).\n\nWait, so how many 3(1+3( are there? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is (1+3). So, my initial computation up to L9 is correct, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a simpler version with fewer layers, like 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nStart from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nWait, but according to my method, that would be L1=4, L2=15, L3=48, and then the total is 3*L3=147, which is correct. So, that seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, if we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), compute:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, which has 9 layers, the result should be 108252.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again, to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nCompute each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication steps again to be sure.\n\nCompute L2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nL3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nL4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nL5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nL6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nL7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nL8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Now, 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so total is 12027. Correct.\n\nL9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3:\n\n12000*3 = 36000\n\n28*3 = 84\n\nSo, 36000 + 84 = 36084. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that there are indeed 9 layers. Let me count the number of 3(1+3( in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(, that's layer1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 3(1+3(, that's layer2.\n\nContinuing this way, each 3(1+3( adds a new layer. Let me count how many times this occurs:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer9. Therefore, L9 is 36084, and the total expression is 3*L9 = 108252.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for geometric series or something similar, to see if I can get the same result.\n\nWait, looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from L1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + L(n-1)).\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nLet me define L(n) as the value at the nth layer. So, L(1) = 4, L(2) = 15, L(3) = 48, etc.\n\nWe can see that L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\nL(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1).\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 3 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p = 3 + 3*L_p\n\n=> 0 = 3 + 2*L_p\n\n=> L_p = -3/2.\n\nWait, that seems odd because our layers are positive numbers. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the recurrence again. It's L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1). So, the particular solution approach should work.\n\nAssume L_p is a constant. Then,\n\nL_p = 3 + 3*L_p\n\n=> 0 = 3 + 2*L_p\n\n=> L_p = -3/2.\n\nHmm, but our initial terms are positive, so perhaps this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern by computing a few terms.\n\nLet me compute L(1) to L(4):\n\nL(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, that's similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express L(n) as 3^n * something. Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nLet me write down L(n) in terms of 3^n:\n\nL(1) = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nL(2) = 15 = 3^2 + 6\n\nL(3) = 48 = 3^3 + 21\n\nL(4) = 147 = 3^4 + 66\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, let me try to express L(n) in terms of a sum.\n\nSince L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)), we can write:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using the method for such equations.\n\nThe general solution is L(n) = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSo, L_p = 3 + 3*L_p.\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p = 3 + 3*L_p\n\n=> 0 = 3 + 2*L_p\n\n=> L_p = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdd 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\n=> C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333.\n\nWait, but that would give L(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\nL(1) = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2) = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL(3) = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - (3/2) = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nL(4) = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = (297/2) - (3/2) = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the general formula for L(n) is:\n\nL(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11*3^n)/6 = (11*3^(n-1))/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (11*3^(n-1))/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^(n-1) - 3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, L(n) = (3^(n+1) + 3)/2. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 11*3^(n-1) - 3 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute 11*3^(n-1) - 3.\n\nWait, let me see for n=1:\n\n11*3^(0) - 3 = 11*1 -3 = 8, so L(1)=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\n11*3^(1) -3 = 33 -3=30, so L(2)=30/2=15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n11*3^2 -3= 99 -3=96, so L(3)=96/2=48. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, L(n) = (11*3^(n-1) - 3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, factoring 3:\n\n= (11*3^(n-1) - 3)/2 = (3*(11*3^(n-2) -1))/2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it as (11*3^(n-1) - 3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\nL(9) = (11*3^(8) - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561.\n\nSo, L(9) = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the general formula.\n\nLet me compute L(9) using the formula:\n\nL(9) = (11*3^8 -3)/2 = (11*6561 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\n6561*10=65610\n\n6561*1=6561\n\nTotal: 65610 + 6561 = 72171.\n\nThen, subtract 3: 72171 -3 = 72168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 /2 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula.\n\nSince the entire expression is 3*L(9), and L(9) = (11*3^8 -3)/2, then:\n\nTotal expression = 3*(11*3^8 -3)/2 = (33*3^8 -9)/2.\n\nCompute 33*3^8:\n\n3^8=6561\n\n33*6561: Let's compute 30*6561=196830, and 3*6561=19683, so total=196830 +19683=216513.\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216513 -9=216504.\n\nDivide by 2: 216504 /2=108252.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the total value is 108252.\n\nWait, but I'm starting to think that maybe there's a more straightforward way to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. But for this problem, since it's only 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived, L(n) = (11*3^(n-1) -3)/2, we can compute any layer directly. For n=9, L(9)=36084, and the total expression is 3*36084=108252.\n\nI think I've verified this sufficiently. The key was to recognize the recursive structure and compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Then, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation helped confirm the result.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the recursive pattern.\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost, moving outward.\n3. Use a recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for the nth layer.\n4. Apply the formula to compute the outermost layer.\n5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n6. Verify the calculations through multiple methods and cross-checking.\n\nThis systematic approach helped me avoid mistakes and ensured that the result is accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{108252}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer step by step from the innermost part.\n\n1. **Innermost layer**: Compute \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_2 = 3 \\times (1 + L_1) = 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n3. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_3 = 3 \\times (1 + L_2) = 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\).\n4. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_4 = 3 \\times (1 + L_3) = 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\).\n5. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_5 = 3 \\times (1 + L_4) = 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\).\n6. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_6 = 3 \\times (1 + L_5) = 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\).\n7. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_7 = 3 \\times (1 + L_6) = 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\).\n8. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_8 = 3 \\times (1 + L_7) = 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\\).\n9. **Next layer**: Compute \\(L_9 = 3 \\times (1 + L_8) = 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\\).\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_9\\). Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[3 \\times 36084 = 108252\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{108252}\\)."

But wait, actually, looking back, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So perhaps I was miscounting the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and then each of those is multiplied by 3, except the outermost which is just multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the expression as a series of nested terms, each being 1 + 3 times the next inner term, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, let me think of it as:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each inner expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers. The innermost expression is E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9, since there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) terms. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n10. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nWait, actually, perhaps there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me check: each time you go one layer out, you add another (1 + 3*(...)). So from the innermost (1 + 3), each step out adds another layer. So maybe there are 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So each time, we have a new layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo inside the outermost 3*(...), there's 1 + 3*(...), which itself contains another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So how many times does 1 + 3*(...) occur? Let's see:\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 1 + 3 is another layer. So starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So after computing Layer9, which is 29524, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4. So after 9 layers, we have Layer9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nThus, B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, which is n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I applied the formula correctly. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see the pattern as each layer being 3^{n} - 1)/2, but scaled by 3.\n\nWait, no, the formula I derived is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, it's 3^{10} -1 over 2, which is 59049 -1 over 2, which is 59048 over 2, which is 29524, correct.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step seems to check out, and the formula approach confirms the result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is then \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to write it out step by step.\n\nLet me start by labeling each part to keep track. Maybe if I number the innermost expression first and work my way out, it'll help. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that result is multiplied by 3 and added 1, and so on. Let me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each level starting from the innermost as Level 1, then Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, how many times does this nesting occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. Hmm, let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 1+3, there's another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats. From the first 1+3, how many times does 3(1+3) appear? Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3(1+3, then another 3(1+3, and so on, until the last one is 1+3). So, perhaps there are 8 layers? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is another layer. Let me see how many 3( are there before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps it's 8 layers because after each 3(, there's a 1+3(...)). Hmm, maybe I should just compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute from the innermost expression. Let's start with the innermost part and work our way out.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression, which is 1+3. Then, moving outward, each step will be 1 + 3*(result of the inner step). So, let's start.\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Compute 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 4). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 5). So, 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but now, after Step 9, is that the outermost layer? Let me check the original expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, after computing up to Step 9, the innermost expression, the next step would be to multiply by 3 and add 1? Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, perhaps each step I did was the innermost part, and then each step outwards, so after Step 9, the entire inner part is 29524, so the next step is to multiply by 3 and add 1? Wait, no, because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression is 29524, which is the result of 1 + 3*something, but actually, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Wait, maybe I should think of it as each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) being a layer, so perhaps the total number of layers is 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try again, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of steps.\n\nWait, let me visualize the expression:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the first 1+3, each subsequent layer is another 1+3*(...), up to 8 layers, and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of levels. Let me try to write each level as I compute it, starting from the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so after 9 levels, the innermost part is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, perhaps after computing up to Level 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24. Wait, actually, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24. But maybe it's easier to compute digit by digit.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\n(4\u00d73)=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n(2\u00d73)=6 +1=7\n(5\u00d73)=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n(9\u00d73)=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n(2\u00d73)=6 +2=8\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm that I have 9 layers. Because when I computed up to Level 9, I had 29,524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, 1+3, then each time, another 1 + 3*(...), how many times does that happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1+3. Each 1+3 is followed by another 3*(1+3, except the last one. So, the number of times 3*(1+3 appears is 8 times after the first one. So, perhaps there are 8 layers, not 9.\n\nWait, maybe I should recount the layers. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but if the original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), then the outermost 3* is applied to Level 9, so the total would be 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears within the parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is followed by another 3*(...), except the last one. So, how many 1+3 are there? Let's see:\n\nEach set of parentheses after the first 3(1+3 is another 3(1+3, except the last one. So, from the innermost, there are 8 layers where 1+3 is followed by another 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, so when I computed up to Level 8, which was 9841, then the entire expression is 3*(Level 8) = 3*9841 = 29,523, and then perhaps that's the final result? But that doesn't seem right because when I computed up to Level 9, I had 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of times 3*(1+3 appears. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1+3. Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(1+3, there are 8 more opening parentheses before the last 1+3. So, that would mean there are 8 layers of 1+3*(...). So, perhaps the innermost is Level 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*(4)=13\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*(13)=40\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*(40)=121\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*(121)=364\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*(364)=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*(1093)=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*(3280)=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 8) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier computation. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the expression as a series of nested functions and count the number of times 1+3*(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 (Level 1)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (Level 2)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (Level 3)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (Level 4)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (Level 5)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (Level 6)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (Level 7)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (Level 8)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (Level 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, perhaps there are 9 layers, meaning that after computing up to Level 9, I need to multiply by 3 once more.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1+3. Each 1+3 is followed by another 3*(1+3, except the last one. So, how many times does 3*(1+3 occur after the first one? Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(1+3, there are 8 more 3*(1+3 expressions, each nested within the previous. So, that would make 8 layers, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the outermost 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that each time I have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the base case. Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, including the outermost 3*(...). Hmm, but that might not be correct because the outermost is just a single multiplication by 3, not another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a function that's applied multiple times. Let me define f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but that doesn't match my earlier steps. Wait, perhaps that's a different approach.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should model it as a recurrence relation. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 terms, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, that would correspond to a_9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3, giving 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I computed a_9, it was 29524, which is the result of 1 + 3*a_8. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the 9th layer. So, yes, that would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually computing each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my earlier calculations.\n\nStarting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 8 layers, I had 9841, which when multiplied by 3 gives 29,523, but that doesn't match the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the number of layers. Let me see the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(1+3(...)). So, after 9 layers, the innermost part is 1+3, and each layer builds upon the previous.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the number of layers again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1+3. Each time, there's another 3*(1+3, so how many times does that happen? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3*(1+3, there are 8 more 3*(1+3 expressions. So, that would be 8 layers, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the outermost 3*(...) is the 9th layer. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each 3*(1+3(...) as a layer, so the first layer is 3*(1+3), then the second layer is 3*(1+3*(3*(1+3))), and so on. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, the expression is a nested multiplication. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after n layers, the value is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each step again without any mistakes.\n\nCompute each layer:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let's count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and I can see that from the innermost (1 + 3), there are 8 layers of 3(...). Wait, let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3) + 1? Wait, no, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). Wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So maybe I should start from the innermost and compute each step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, starting with L1:\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, L2 is 1 + 3*L1. So substituting L1:\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 would be 1 + 3*L2:\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3:\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4:\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5:\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6:\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7:\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(L8). So, 3*9841.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and starting from the innermost, we have (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3) as layer 1, each time we move out, we have another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears, each time being multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Let's see:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 L1\n2. 3*(1+3) \u2192 L2\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)) \u2192 L3\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))) \u2192 L4\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each layer corresponds to each set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses: from the innermost, each layer has a closing parenthesis, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), which is 1 closing parenthesis. Then, each subsequent layer adds another closing parenthesis. So, how many closing parentheses are there in total? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let's count them:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3) \u2192 1 closing\n- Next layer is (1+3(...)) \u2192 another closing\n- Continuing outward, each layer adds another closing parenthesis.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 closing parentheses. Wait, let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 1\n2. (1+3(...)) \u2192 2\n3. (1+3(...)) \u2192 3\n4. ... up to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, since each layer is a set of parentheses, starting from the innermost. Let me check: the expression is 3(1+3(...)), and each time we go in, it's another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's 1 layer, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times \"1+3\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after a 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each of these is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's 1, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3(...\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n- Then, moving out, 1 + 3(layer1) \u2192 layer 2\n- Then, 1 + 3(layer2) \u2192 layer3\n- And so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because the expression has 9 sets of parentheses starting from the innermost. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer1\n2. (1+3(layer1)) \u2192 layer2\n3. (1+3(layer2)) \u2192 layer3\n4. (1+3(layer3)) \u2192 layer4\n5. (1+3(layer4)) \u2192 layer5\n6. (1+3(layer5)) \u2192 layer6\n7. (1+3(layer6)) \u2192 layer7\n8. (1+3(layer7)) \u2192 layer8\n9. (1+3(layer8)) \u2192 layer9\n\nWait, but the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, total layers are 9. So, each layer from L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I only went up to L8, but perhaps I missed one. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So, the total expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did up to L8, I had L8 = 9841, and then I thought the outermost was 3*L8, which would be 3*9841 = 29523. But now, I'm seeing that maybe I missed a layer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 L1\n2. (1+3(L1)) \u2192 L2\n3. (1+3(L2)) \u2192 L3\n4. (1+3(L3)) \u2192 L4\n5. (1+3(L4)) \u2192 L5\n6. (1+3(L5)) \u2192 L6\n7. (1+3(L6)) \u2192 L7\n8. (1+3(L7)) \u2192 L8\n9. (1+3(L8)) \u2192 L9\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, I need to compute up to L9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to L8 and thought the outermost was 3*L8, but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the outermost is 3*(L9). So, perhaps my initial approach was missing a layer. Let me try again, computing up to L9.\n\nSo, let's start over, computing each layer step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let me do it properly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were only 8 layers, I got 3*9841 = 29523, but that's incorrect because I missed the 9th layer. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLet me recast each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each time we have another layer. So, from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each time adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, L9 is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute it another way, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think.\n\nThis expression is of the form:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))\n\nWhich is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nThus, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Let me try to write down the expression and see how many layers there are. Starting from the inside, it's 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by the previous result. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, I see that each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and I think there are nine layers here because each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Wait, let me check again. The problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(... nine times...))). So, actually, there are nine layers of 1+3 multiplied by the next layer. So, maybe I should start solving from the innermost layer and work my way outwards. Let me write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: Let's call each layer L1, L2, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost and L1 is the outermost. So, L9 is 1+3, which is 4. Then L8 would be 1 + 3*(L9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So L8 is 13.\n\nNow, L7 would be 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So L7 is 40.\n\nNext, L6 is 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So L6 is 121.\n\nThen, L5 is 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So L5 is 364.\n\nMoving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So L4 is 1093.\n\nNow, L3 is 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So L3 is 3280.\n\nNext, L2 is 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So L2 is 9841.\n\nFinally, L1 is the outermost layer: 3*(L2) = 3*9841. Wait, hold on, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in how I'm handling the layers. Let me clarify: Each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(next layer). But when I'm multiplying by 3, that's part of the next layer. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try again, but this time considering that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)).\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me look at the original expression again: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Therefore, each layer's value is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer's value)).\n\nWait, that might complicate things because each layer is being multiplied by 3, so I might need to adjust my approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider each layer as 1 + 3*(next layer), and then the entire expression is 3*(that result). So, maybe I should compute each layer starting from the innermost, but each time, the layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and then the outermost layer is 3 times that.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake because when I computed Layer9 as 1 + 3*Layer8, which was 1 + 3*9841, which is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(... nine times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, there are nine 1+3 terms. So, each time, we compute 1 + 3*(next layer), and the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, with nine layers, each computed as above, leading to Layer9 being 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed the layers, I ended up with Layer9 as 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But I have a feeling that maybe I should have included the 3*(...) at each step, which might mean that the layers are actually being computed as 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would change the calculation. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the layers. Let me clarify: Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 3*(1 + 3). Let me see.\n\nWait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, let me try this again:\n\nLayer1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, Layer2 is 39.\n\nThen, Layer3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404.\n\nWait, that's a very different result. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't account for the 3* at each layer. So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), which leads to a much larger number. But that seems inconsistent with the initial problem statement. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and the entire expression is 3*(the result of the innermost layers). Wait, so perhaps the innermost is 1+3=4, then the next layer is 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, and so on, as I did initially, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, in that case, Layer9 would be 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. But when I tried the other approach, where each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), I ended up with a much larger number, 188,329,404, which seems way too big.\n\nI think I might have confused the structure of the expression. Let me parse the original expression more carefully. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by the next nested expression). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, that would mean that Layer1 is 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier approach. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as each layer being 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), starting from the innermost. Let me try that again.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1 inside. So, the final result would be 188,329,404. But that seems really large, and I'm not sure if that's correct because when I did the initial approach without considering the 3* at each layer, I got 88,572, which is much smaller.\n\nI think the confusion is whether each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)) or if the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me clarify by looking at a smaller version of the problem. Suppose I have just 3*(1 + 3). That would be 3*(4) = 12. Alternatively, if I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), that would be 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. So, each additional layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, in the original problem, there are nine layers of 1+3, each multiplied by 3 in the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(9568) = 28704.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(86113) = 258339.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(775018) = 2325054.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(6975163) = 20925489.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(62776468) = 188329404.\n\nSo, the final result is 188,329,404. But wait, when I first did it without considering the 3* at each layer, I got 88,572, which is much smaller. I think the key here is to correctly parse the expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), meaning that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)), starting from the innermost 1+3. So, that approach gives a much larger number, but I think it's correct because each layer is indeed 3 multiplied by the next expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers.\n\nLet me list out the layers again with their values:\n\nLayer1 (innermost): 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*86113 = 258339.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*775018 = 2325054.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*6975163 = 20925489.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*62776468 = 188329404.\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me define each layer as a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the final result is a_9 = 188,329,404.\n\nBut wait, let me check if this approach is correct. Because each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, to find a_9, we can compute each a_n step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na_n = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's write it as:\n\na_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 3.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*9^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 9*K = 3 => -8K = 3 => K = -3/8.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*9^n - 3/8.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*9^1 - 3/8 = 9C - 3/8 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n9C = 4 + 3/8 = 35/8.\n\nThus, C = (35/8) / 9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nWe can write 9^n as 9^{n}.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8.\n\nFirst, compute 9^9.\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59049\n\n9^6 = 531441\n\n9^7 = 4782969\n\n9^8 = 43046721\n\n9^9 = 387420489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489.\n\nNow, compute (35/72)*387,420,489.\n\nFirst, let's compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\nDividing 387,420,489 by 72:\n\n72 * 5,000,000 = 360,000,000.\n\nSubtract: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489.\n\n72 * 380,000 = 27,360,000.\n\nSubtract: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489.\n\n72 * 839 = 60,489 (since 72*800=57,600; 72*39=2,808; 57,600 + 2,808 = 60,408; but 72*839=72*(800+39)=57,600 + 2,808=60,408. Hmm, but 60,489 - 60,408 = 81, which is 72*1.125, so maybe it's not exact. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 72 * 839 = ?\n\nCompute 800*72 = 57,600\n\n39*72 = 2,808\n\nSo, total is 57,600 + 2,808 = 60,408.\n\nBut we have 60,489, which is 60,408 + 81 = 60,489.\n\nSo, 72*839 + 72*1 = 72*840 = 60,480. But 60,480 + 81 = 60,561, which is too much. Wait, perhaps I should compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 35/72 * 387,420,489.\n\nLet me compute 387,420,489 * 35 first, then divide by 72.\n\nBut that might be cumbersome. Alternatively, let me compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 first.\n\nCompute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72:\n\n72 * 5,000,000 = 360,000,000.\n\nSubtract: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489.\n\n72 * 380,000 = 27,360,000.\n\nSubtract: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489.\n\nNow, 72 * 839 = 60,408, as before.\n\nSo, total is 5,000,000 + 380,000 + 839 = 5,380,839 with a remainder of 60,489 - 60,408 = 81.\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 = 5,380,839 + 81/72 = 5,380,839 + 1.125 = 5,380,840.125.\n\nNow, multiply by 35:\n\n5,380,840.125 * 35.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, 5,380,840 * 35:\n\n5,380,840 * 35 = 5,380,840 * (30 + 5) = 5,380,840*30 + 5,380,840*5.\n\n5,380,840*30 = 161,425,200.\n\n5,380,840*5 = 26,904,200.\n\nAdding them: 161,425,200 + 26,904,200 = 188,329,400.\n\nNow, the 0.125 part: 0.125 * 35 = 4.375.\n\nSo, total is 188,329,400 + 4.375 = 188,329,404.375.\n\nBut since we're dealing with integers, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that 35/72 * 387,420,489 = (35 * 387,420,489) / 72.\n\nBut regardless, when we subtract 3/8 from this, we get:\n\na_9 = (35/72)*387,420,489 - 3/8.\n\nWe already have (35/72)*387,420,489 = 188,329,404.375.\n\nNow, subtract 3/8, which is 0.375.\n\nSo, 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404.\n\nWhich matches the value we obtained earlier by iterating each layer.\n\nSo, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed the layers step by step, I ended up with a_9 = 188,329,404, which matches the closed-form solution. Therefore, that must be the correct answer.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the answer was 88,572, which was when I didn't account for the 3* at each layer. So, I think that approach was incorrect because I didn't properly apply the 3* at each layer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with a smaller number of layers to see if this approach is correct.\n\nFor example, if we have 3*(1 + 3), that's 3*4 = 12.\n\nUsing the closed-form formula: a_1 = (35/72)*9^1 - 3/8 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8 = (35/8) - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4. Wait, but that's not matching because a_1 is supposed to be 4, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the indexing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and that would correspond to a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8 = (35/8) - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (35/72)*81 - 3/8 = (35*81)/72 - 3/8.\n\nCompute 35*81 = 2835.\n\n2835 \u00f7 72 = 39.4375.\n\n39.4375 - 0.375 = 39.0625. Wait, that's not matching a_2 which is 39.\n\nWait, 35/72 * 81 = (35*81)/72 = (35*9*9)/72 = (315*9)/72 = 2835/72 = 39.4375.\n\nSubtract 3/8 = 0.375: 39.4375 - 0.375 = 39.0625, which is not an integer, but a_2 is 39. So, perhaps the formula is not correctly applied.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is intended for n starting at 0, not n=1. Let me check.\n\nIf n=0: a_0 = (35/72)*1 - 3/8 = 35/72 - 27/72 = 8/72 = 1/9. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial condition was misapplied. Let me re-examine the recurrence.\n\nWe had a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}).\n\nWe set a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the homogeneous solution was a_n^{(h)} = C*9^n.\n\nThe particular solution was K = -3/8.\n\nThus, a_n = C*9^n - 3/8.\n\nUsing a_1 = 4: 4 = C*9 - 3/8.\n\nSo, C*9 = 4 + 3/8 = 35/8.\n\nThus, C = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8 = (35/8) - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (35/72)*81 - 3/8 = (35*81)/72 - 3/8.\n\nCompute 35*81 = 2835.\n\n2835 \u00f7 72: 72*39 = 2808, remainder 27. So, 2835/72 = 39 + 27/72 = 39 + 3/8 = 39.375.\n\nSubtract 3/8: 39.375 - 0.375 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: a_3 = (35/72)*729 - 3/8.\n\n35*729 = 25,515.\n\n25,515 \u00f7 72: 72*354 = 25,488, remainder 27. So, 25,515/72 = 354 + 27/72 = 354 + 3/8 = 354.375.\n\nSubtract 3/8: 354.375 - 0.375 = 354. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works, and a_9 is indeed 188,329,404.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step, starting from the inner"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is just (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Then, moving one level out, we have 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. Okay, so the next level out is 1 + 3*(13). Hmm, 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check my math: 3*13 is indeed 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nMoving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 plus 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Next level out is 1 + 3*(121). Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives us 364. Hmm, that's a big jump. Let me confirm: 121*3 is 363, yes, and 363 +1 is 364. Correct.\n\nGoing another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(364). Let's see: 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. That seems right. Let me just double-check: 364*3 is 1092, yes, and 1092 +1 is 1093. Okay, moving on.\n\nNext, we have 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. Wait, 1093*3 is 3279, correct, and 3279 +1 is 3280. That's correct.\n\nThen, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. Hmm, that's a large number, but let me check: 3280*3 is indeed 9840, and adding 1 gives 9841. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNext level out is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate that: 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Let me confirm: 9841*3 is 29523, yes, and 29523 +1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, and adding 1 gives 88573. Let me check: 29524*3 is 88572, yes, and 88572 +1 is 88573. Okay, that's correct.\n\nThen, the next level out is 1 + 3*(88573). Calculating that: 3*88573 is 265719, and adding 1 gives 265720. Let me verify: 88573*3 is 265719, yes, and 265719 +1 is 265720. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 3*265720 is 797160, and adding 1 gives 797161. Wait, that seems like a huge number, but let me check: 265720*3 is indeed 797160, and 797160 +1 is 797161. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The original problem is 3 times all of that. So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working outwards, we end up with 797161, and then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*797161. Let me compute that: 700,000*3 is 2,100,000, 97,161*3 is 291,483. Wait, that can't be right because 797,161*3 would be 2,391,483. Let me do it step by step: 700,000*3=2,100,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 7,000*3=21,000; 100*3=300; 60*3=180; 1*3=3. Adding them up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; plus 21,000 is 2,391,000; plus 300 is 2,391,300; plus 180 is 2,391,480; plus 3 is 2,391,483. So, 3*797,161 is indeed 2,391,483.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the number of layers. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine sets of (1+3(...)), but maybe I should count them.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first inner expression is (1+3(...)), and each subsequent one is another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, so that means there are 9 layers. Wait, but when I started computing, I only went through 9 layers, right? Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n\nWait, hold on, that's 12 steps, but I only have 9 layers. So, maybe I overcounted. Let me try again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*(88573) = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*(265720) = 797161\n\nWait, but that's 12 steps, but the expression only has 9 layers. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Starting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The first (1+3(...\n2. Then another (1+3(...\n3. And so on, until the ninth (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each time adding another (1+3(...)). So, that would mean that after computing the innermost, we have 9 layers to compute. So, perhaps I overcounted earlier. Let me try to compute it correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought I had 797161, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's parse it:\n\n- The first layer is 3*(...), where the ... is (1 + 3*(...))\n- The next layer is (1 + 3*(...))\n- Each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, right? Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524), which is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 797161, which was after 12 layers, but that must be incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers. So, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 797161, but that must have been a miscalculation because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, after computing 9 layers, we have 29524, and then the outermost 3* that gives 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 12 layers, I ended up with 797161, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I miscounted the layers because the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me recompute each step:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the final multiplication by 3 gives the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3(, there are eight sets of (1 + 3(...)), so maybe that's eight layers. Let me check:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3).\n2. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(result of step 1)).\n3. Then the next is (1 + 3*(result of step 2)).\n4. Continuing this way until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are nine (1 + 3(...)) terms. Let me count the closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis should have a corresponding closing one. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, the structure is 3(1 + 3(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) parts.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Let me try to compute from the innermost layer first.\n\nLet's start by computing the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from innermost)). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*(result from previous layer)). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to see if there's a pattern here. Let me list the results as I go out each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers earlier. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 L1 = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*(L1)) \u2192 L2 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*(L2)) \u2192 L3 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*(L3)) \u2192 L4 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*(L4)) \u2192 L5 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*(L5)) \u2192 L6 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*(L6)) \u2192 L7 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*(L7)) \u2192 L8 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*(L8)) \u2192 L9 = ?\n\nWait, so maybe I missed a layer earlier. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, how many times does the pattern 1 + 3(...) occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are nine (1 + 3(...) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because each (1 + 3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count how many times the pattern 1 + 3(...) appears. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLet me see: starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 L1 = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*L1) \u2192 L2 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*L2) \u2192 L3 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*L3) \u2192 L4 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*L4) \u2192 L5 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*L5) \u2192 L6 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*L6) \u2192 L7 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*L7) \u2192 L8 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*L8) \u2192 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression only has eight layers, right? Because after the initial 3(, there are eight (1 + 3(...) terms. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n- The first ( after 3( is the start of the first (1 + 3(...)), which is the innermost.\n\nThen, each time, another ( starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3(, each ( starts a new layer. Let's count how many ( there are after 3(:\n\n1. ( after 3( \u2192 layer 1\n2. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 2\n3. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 3\n4. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 4\n5. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 5\n6. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 6\n7. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 7\n8. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 8\n9. ( after 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 9\n\nWait, so there are nine layers? Because each ( starts a new layer, and after 3(, there are nine (1 + 3(...) expressions. Hmm, that seems correct because each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier when I thought there were eight layers. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds another (1 + 3(...)), so let's count the number of (1 + 3(...) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each time we have a new layer, so starting from the innermost, each time we go one layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I have L1 as the innermost, then L2 is the next layer, and so on until L9, which would be the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, but the initial expression is 3*(something). So, after computing L9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*L8), then we multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 to L9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let's list them again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3, I think I made a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me list each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought there were eight layers, I got a different result, but now with nine layers, I get 88572. Let me make sure I counted the layers correctly.\n\nLooking at the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...) terms after the initial 3(:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L1\n2. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L2\n3. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L3\n4. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L4\n5. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L5\n6. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L6\n7. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L7\n8. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L8\n9. (1 + 3(...)) \u2192 L9\n\nWait, so that's nine layers. So, L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the initial 3. So, the initial expression is 3*(L9). Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), and each time, we have to go one layer out. Let me count the number of times 3(1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the expression with indices to see the layers better.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n represents the nth layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each a_n again:\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that when I computed a_9, I used a_8 = 9841, which is correct because a_8 is 1 + 3*a_7, and a_7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Then, a_9 is 1 + 3*9841, which is 1 + 29523, which is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer manually. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the sequence a_n, each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Since the original expression has nine layers, meaning a_9 is the outermost, then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series, since each layer is a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try expanding a_9:\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6\n\nAnd so on, until a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, expanding a_9:\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWhich is exactly the structure of the original expression inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the original expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(1 + 3*a_8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived earlier, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough steps, and each time I arrive at the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way out step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L2 = 1 + 3 \\times L1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L3 = 1 + 3 \\times L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L4 = 1 + 3 \\times L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L5 = 1 + 3 \\times L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L6 = 1 + 3 \\times L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L7 = 1 + 3 \\times L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L8 = 1 + 3 \\times L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L9 = 1 + 3 \\times L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times L9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

That seems manageable. Let me compute that first.\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses first: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the innermost was 4, the next one would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. If I have 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3*4, that's indeed 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's a jump. So, the next layer is 40.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and adding 1. So, the process is: starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can model this as a sequence where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yeah, that's right.\n\nThen a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 + 1 is 364. So, a5 is 364.\n\nThen a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, a6 is 1093.\n\nMoving on, a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, a7 is 3280.\n\nNext, a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, a8 is 9841.\n\nThen, a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, a9 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*a9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost part has been worked out to a9 = 29524. So, the final computation is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sequence of a1 to a9. Let me list them again:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But maybe I can check a few of these steps again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLet me check a4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 3279 +1 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 9840 +1 =9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after carefully checking each step, it seems that the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each step is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such sequences.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1.\n\nWait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's check what n is. The initial term a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nSo, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1 + 3(...)): There are 9 layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) up to the 9th layer, which is a9. So, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can see that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify the formula again. The nth term is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using another approach, maybe by expanding the expression step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can compute a few more terms using the formula to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, a3 should be (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which matches our earlier result. a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121, which also matches. So, the formula seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2.

And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe I can count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me see: each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nAnd then, the entire expression is 3*E8. So, the problem is 3*(E8), where E8 is defined as above.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, to compute the entire expression, I can compute E1 through E8 step by step and then multiply the result by 3. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E8, so 3*9841 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 9841 * 3. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E1 to E8.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*E8 = 3*9841. Let me compute that again:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nCompute 9000*3 = 27,000\n\n800*3 = 2,400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or formula. Because computing each E step by step might be time-consuming, but perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) can be expressed as a geometric series or using a recursive formula.\n\nLet me think about this. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps it's easier to compute each step as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, E_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, E8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*(9841) = 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3^9 is indeed 19,683.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, E8 = (19,683 -1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841.\n\nThen, 3*9,841 = 29,523.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29,523.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I initially thought maybe there's a pattern where each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, since each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, and E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found, then for n=8, E8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9,841, so the total expression is 3*E8 = 29,523.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression in a different way, but I think the step-by-step approach is solid here.\n\nWait, another way: Let me try to compute the innermost expression and work my way out, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9,841 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again, just to be sure.\n\n9,841 * 3:\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 9,841 * 3 by another method.\n\nLet me compute 9,841 * 3:\n\nMultiply each digit:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24, plus 1 carried over is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 2 carried over is 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9 is in the thousands place, so it's actually 9,000, so 9 * 3 = 27, plus 2 carried over is 29, so write down 9 and carry over 2, but since there are no more digits, we write 29.\n\nWait, but that would be 29,523. Wait, no, actually, let's do it properly:\n\n9,841\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24, plus 1 carried over is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 2 carried over is 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nSince there are no more digits, write down the carried over 2.\n\nSo, the result is 29,523. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 29,523.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any errors in my reasoning. The key was recognizing the pattern and computing each nested expression step by step, then applying the final multiplication by 3.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all eight layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 9,841. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Define the Nested Expressions:**\n   Let E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   The entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9,841 = 29,523\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

    "text": " Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There's one after the first 3, then each subsequent 3 has another opening parenthesis. Let me count: 3(...), then another 3(...), so that's two. Then another, so three, and so on. Wait, actually, let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(...)), and each time it's another 3(...). So how many times does this happen? Let me try to parse it. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the left, each time after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis, and each time, it's 1 + 3 times something. So the innermost part is the last one: 1+3). Then moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s before each parenthesis. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me try to write it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from inside out. Let's say the innermost is layer 1, then the next one out is layer 2, up to layer 9, maybe? Let me check.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3). Then the next layer is 3*(1+3). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps it's better to work from the inside out.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's start from the innermost expression and work our way out. The innermost part is (1+3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, except the last one, which just ends with 1+3). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3s before the parentheses. Starting from the left, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), then each subsequent 3 is followed by another (1+3(...)). Let me count: starting from the first 3, then each 3 inside adds another layer. So from the first 3, there are 9 layers? Wait, no, because the innermost is (1+3), which is just two numbers, so maybe 9 layers of 3s. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3s before each parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times this occurs. Let's see: the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So how many times does this happen? Let me see: starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 inside adds another layer. So from the first 3, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 3*(...). So the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3). Then layer 8 is 3*(layer9). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards.\n\nLet me define L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but let's check how many layers there are. The expression has 9 opening parentheses after each 3, so perhaps 9 layers. Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3). Then each layer adds another 3*(...). So let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) \u2192 L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(L1) \u2192 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Because in the original expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which is (1 + 3(...)), so perhaps the layers are 9, but maybe I miscounted. Let me try again, perhaps I went one layer too deep.\n\nWait, let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(...). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1+3), and each layer adds another 3*(...). So the number of layers is 9, right? Because each 3 is followed by a new layer until the innermost.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the number of layers can be tricky. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write each step clearly:\n\n1. Compute the innermost part: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but hold on, when I count the layers, I started from 1 and went up to 9, but the final expression is 3 times the 9th layer. So that would mean the total expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears in the original expression. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen each time, moving outward, we have 1+3(...). So the number of 1+3 expressions is 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1+3.\n\nWait, but when I count the opening parentheses, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, and the innermost is (1+3). So how many opening parentheses are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: after each 3, there's an opening parenthesis, and the innermost is (1+3). So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds another layer. So the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after each 3, which is 9. So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), starting from the innermost (1+3) as layer 1, up to layer 9.\n\nSo my calculation seems correct, with layer 9 being 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me check one more time for any possible miscalculations.\n\nWait, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3 = 60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000 \u2192 60,000+27,000=87,000\n\n500*3=1,500 \u2192 87,000+1,500=88,500\n\n24*3=72 \u2192 88,500+72=88,572\n\nSo 29524 *3=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the number of layers can be off by one. Let me try to write the entire expression with each layer labeled.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that part is straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next expression is 1 + 3*(inner result). Since the inner result was 4, let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that level gives me 13. Now, moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so now we're at 40. Let me keep going. The next level out would be 1 + 3*40.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nOkay, so now we're at 121. Next, moving out another level: 1 + 3*121.\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me continue. The next level is 1 + 3*364.\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's a big number. Now, moving out another level: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nOkay, so now we're at 3280. Next level out: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThat's even bigger. Now, moving out another level: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, so now we're at 29524. The next level out is 1 + 3*29524.\n\n1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWow, that's a huge number. Now, moving out to the outermost level: 1 + 3*88573.\n\n1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nSo, the innermost expression worked its way out to 265720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is to compute 3*265720.\n\n3*265720 = 797160.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 265,720 times 3: 200,000*3=600,000, 60,000*3=180,000, 5,000*3=15,000, 700*3=2,100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 +15,000=795,000; 795,000 +2,100=797,100; 797,100 +60=797,160. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. After computing each level, I ended up with 265,720 before multiplying by the outermost 3, which gave me the final result of 797,160.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Finally: 3*265720 = 797160\n\nYep, that looks right. Each step was computed correctly, and I didn't make any arithmetic errors. So, the final answer should be 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " Let me try to write it out step by step. \n\nLet me start by labeling each part to keep track. The innermost part is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And this continues until we've gone through all the layers.\n\nLet me count how many times this happens. The expression is written as 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (... nine times? Wait, let me check. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. \n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3(...). So that means there are 9 layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working our way out to the first layer.\n\nLet me write this out step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, the innermost part is 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, the second innermost expression evaluates to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's 40. So, the third innermost expression is 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 3).\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThat's 121. So, the fourth layer is 121.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(121)\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nOkay, that's 364. Fifth layer done.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(364)\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nWow, that's a big number. Sixth layer is 1,093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1,093)\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nSeventh layer is 3,280.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(3,280)\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nEighth layer is 9,841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(9,841)\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nWait, hold on. But the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing the innermost expression all the way out, which we just did as 29,524, we then have to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me double-check. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the nested 1 + 3*(...) parts.\n\nBut in my steps above, I computed the innermost expression and worked my way out, ending up with 29,524 as the result of the innermost part, which is the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). But actually, the way the problem is structured, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the result of the inner expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused in my earlier steps. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me define each layer properly. Let me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\n...\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*E_9\n\nSo, that would be 3*(E_9), where E_9 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nSo, in that case, I need to compute E_1 through E_9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to E_9 being 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*E_9, so that would be 3*29,524, which is 88,572. But that seems too large, so maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again. Maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me try again, perhaps this time keeping track of each E_n.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but that seems very large. Let me check if I did each step correctly.\n\nWait, let me recalculate each E_n step by step, just to be sure.\n\nE_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nE_7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nE_8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nE_9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29,524:\n\nFirst, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000\n\nBut 29,524 is 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so that's 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers. So E_9 is the innermost, and then we have 9 layers. So the entire expression is 3*E_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like 88,572 might be correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written such that each 1+3 is a separate layer, but perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for E_n, which might help me compute it without having to calculate each step manually.\n\nLooking at the recursive formula: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, which in this case is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is E_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution.\n\nE_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1\n\nAssume E_n = C*3^n + D\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D + 1\n= C*3^n + 3D + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nC*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 3D + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n-2D = 1\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nE_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nE_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for E_9, that would be:\n\nE_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, E_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each step manually. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses. Let me confirm.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Therefore, there are 9 layers, each with their own 1+3*(...). So, E_9 is the innermost, and the entire expression is 3*E_9.\n\nSo, with E_9 = 29,524, then the total is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just compute 3*29,524 again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute E_n using the closed-form formula and see if it matches.\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*E_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series.\n\nEach E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nSo, expanding this, E_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, E_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*E_0\n\nBut wait, E_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nSimilarly, E_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but if I try to express E_n as a sum, it's a geometric series.\n\nWait, from the recurrence E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nLet me unroll the recurrence:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*E_{n-2}\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*E_{n-3})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*E_{n-3}\n...\nContinuing this way, we get:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*E_0\n\nBut wait, E_0 would be undefined here, but since E_1 = 4 = 1 + 3, perhaps E_0 = 1.\n\nWait, let me check. If n=1, E_1 = 1 + 3*E_0\n\nBut E_1 is given as 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*E_0 => E_0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1.\n\nSo, E_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*E_0\n\nBut since E_0 = 1, then E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k\n\nWait, that's a geometric series with ratio 3, from k=0 to n.\n\nSum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWhich matches the closed-form solution I found earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each step, verifying the recurrence relation, and using the closed-form solution, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outwards. \n\n1.

    "text": " Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, the expression starts with 3(1+3(...)) and each time, there's another 1+3 inside. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There's one after the first 3, then another, and so on. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). So, maybe there are eight layers inside the first one. Let me check: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, that seems too big. Did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n10. Then the outermost is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3(1+3(...)) and each time, there are nine layers. So maybe I'm counting correctly. Let me try to write it down step by step:\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + L9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check if I made a mistake in the counting. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might take too long and could lead to errors.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), and so on. So, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using that approach. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3a_{n-1} + 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^n)/6 = (11*3^{n})/6\n\nBut 3^{n} = 3*3^{n-1}, so maybe we can write it differently, but perhaps it's better to compute a_9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 \u00f7 6: 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, even though I was worried I might have made a mistake, both methods give me the same answer. That makes me feel better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the numbers I was getting when I computed each layer step by step. Let me check:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 15\n\nL3: 48\n\nL4: 147\n\nL5: 444\n\nL6: 1335\n\nL7: 4008\n\nL8: 12027\n\nL9: 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, so each a_n is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which seems to be growing exponentially, as expected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of each a_n as 3^{n} times some coefficient, but I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward.\n\nWait, but let me check: When I computed a_1, a_2, etc., using the recurrence, I got a_1=4, a_2=15, a_3=48, etc., which seems consistent with the step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I got a general formula, which when applied to n=9, gives a_9=36084, and then the final result is 3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if this expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me define E as the entire expression. Then, starting from the innermost part:\n\nLet me compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nStarting with the innermost 1+3:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression E is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. Did I make a mistake here? Because earlier, I had 108255, but now I'm getting 88572. That means I must have made an error in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let's check. When I did the step-by-step expansion, I got a_9=36084, then E=3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nBut in the second method, when I computed level by level, I got 29524, then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy. That means I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me try again with the second method, computing each level step by step, but more carefully.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but in the first method, using the recurrence relation, I got a_9=36084, which would make E=3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nSo, why the discrepancy? Let me check the definitions.\n\nIn the first method, I defined a_n as starting from the innermost layer, so a_1=4, a_2=15, etc., up to a_9=36084, then E=3*(1 + a_9)=108255.\n\nIn the second method, I started from the innermost as Level 1=4, then Level 2=13, Level 3=40, etc., up to Level 9=29524, then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so in the first method, I have a_9=36084, which would correspond to Level 9 in the second method being 36084, but in the second method, Level 9 is 29524.\n\nSo, clearly, I'm miscounting the levels in one of the methods. Let me try to figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps in the second method, the innermost is Level 1, then each subsequent level adds another layer. So, if the original expression has nine layers, then Level 9 would be the outermost. But in the first method, a_9 is the ninth layer from the innermost, which would correspond to Level 9 in the second method.\n\nWait, but in the second method, I computed up to Level 9 as 29524, which would then be the value of the innermost part, but that can't be right because the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so the innermost is 1+3, which is 4, as in Level 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the levels in the second method. Let me try to parse the original expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the first method, using the recurrence relation, I had a_9=36084, which would mean that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084)=108255. But in the second method, I get 88572. These can't both be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method by miscounting the number of layers. Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, I defined a_n as the value of the nth layer from the innermost, starting with a_1=4. Then, each a_n=3*(1 + a_{n-1}). So, a_1=4, a_2=15, a_3=48, etc., up to a_9=36084. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9)=108255.\n\nBut in the second method, computing each level step by step, I ended up with Level 9=29524, then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first method is correct because it's based on the recurrence, and the second method has an error in counting the levels. Let me check the second method again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the levels. Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*() operation. The original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, when I computed Level 1 as 4, Level 2 as 13, up to Level 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9)=88572.\n\nBut in the first method, I had a_9=36084, which would correspond to Level 9 in the second method being 36084, but in the second method, Level 9 is 29524. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence relation. Let me check the recurrence again.\n\nIn the first method, I defined a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=3*(1+4)=15, a_3=3*(1+15)=48, a_4=3*(1+48)=147, a_5=3*(1+147)=444, a_6=3*(1+444)=1335, a_7=3*(1+1335)=4008, a_8=3*(1+4008)=12027, a_9=3*(1+12027)=36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9)=3*(1 + 36084)=3*36085=108255.\n\nBut in the second method, when I computed each level step by step, I ended up with Level 9=29524, which would make the entire expression 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so where's the mistake? Let me check the step-by-step computation again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence, a_9=36084, so where is this inconsistency coming from?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm miscounting the levels. Let me count the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1: (1+3(...))\n2: (1+3(...))\n3: (1+3(...))\n4: (1+3(...))\n5: (1+3(...))\n6: (1+3(...))\n7: (1+3(...))\n8: (1+3(...))\n9: (1+3(...))\n\nWait, so there are nine layers of 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, layer 1: 1+3=4, layer 2: 1+3*4=13, layer 3: 1+3*13=40, and so on up to layer 9: 1+3*(layer8)=?\n\nWait, but according to the step-by-step computation, layer9=29524, which would make E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, a_9=36084, which would make E=3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial condition of the recurrence. Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, I set a_1=4, which is correct because the innermost layer is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, a_2=3*(1 + a_1)=3*(1+4)=15\n\na_3=3*(1 + a_2)=3*(1+15)=48\n\na_4=3*(1 + a_3)=3*(1+48)=147\n\na_5=3*(1 + a_4)=3*(1+147)=444\n\na_6=3*(1 + a_5)=3*(1+444)=1335\n\na_7=3*(1 + a_6)=3*(1+1335)=4008\n\na_8=3*(1 + a_7)=3*(1+4008)=12027\n\na_9=3*(1 + a_8)=3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9)=3*(1 + 36084)=3*36085=108255\n\nBut in the step-by-step computation, I ended up with Level9=29524, which is different. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps in the step-by-step computation, I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to parse the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it is 1+3(...), which is layer1.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the count is different. Let me try to parse the expression with parentheses:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer1: 4\n\n2. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer1)=1 + 3*4=13, which is layer2\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(layer2)=1 + 3*13=40, layer3\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40=121, layer4\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121=364, layer5\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364=1093, layer6\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093=3280, layer7\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280=9841, layer8\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841=29524, layer9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, so according to this, the entire expression is 88572, but according to the recurrence, it's 108255.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the recurrence approach. Let me check the recurrence again.\n\nI set up the recurrence as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1=4.\n\nThen, solving the recurrence, I found a general solution a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nThen, for n=9, a_9= (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that again:\n\n(11/6)*19683 = (11 * 19683)/6\n\nCompute 19683 \u00f7 6: 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = ?\n\nCompute 3280 * 11 = 36080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nThen, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, a_9=36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9)=3*(1 + 36084)=3*36085=108255\n\nBut in the step-by-step computation, I have layer9=29524, which would make the entire expression 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? It seems like both methods are correct, but they're giving different results, which can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3*(...):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\n2. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n\n...\n\nUp to nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expression has nine layers of 1+3*(...), which would mean that a_9 corresponds to the innermost layer, and the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9). But in the step-by-step computation, I computed up to layer9=29524, which is the innermost, but then the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 29524)=3*29525=88575, which is close to 88572, but not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the step-by-step method.\n\nLet me recompute the step-by-step levels carefully:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence, a_9=36084, which would mean that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nWait, so perhaps the mistake is that in the recurrence, a_n is the value of the nth layer, but the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9), which is 3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nBut in the step-by-step method, I computed up to Level9=29524, which is the innermost layer, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so perhaps the confusion is about whether the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9) or just 3*(a_9). Let me check.\n\nIn the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + a_9), where a_9 is the value of the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3*(...). But in the step-by-step computation, I computed up to Level9=29524, which is the value of the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3*(...), so the entire expression would be 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, a_9=36084, which is the value of the innermost expression, which would make the entire expression 3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step computation, Level9=29524, which is 1 + 3*(Level8)=1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nWait, so if Level9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, a_9=36084, which would be the value of the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3*(...), so the entire expression would be 3*(1 + a_9)=3*(1 + 36084)=108255.\n\nThis suggests that there is a discrepancy between the two methods, which indicates that I made a mistake in one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence. Let me check the initial condition.\n\nIn the recurrence, I set a_1=4, which is correct because the innermost layer is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, a_2=3*(1 + a_1)=15, which is correct.\n\na_3=3*(1 + a_2)=48, correct.\n\na_4=3*(1 + a_3)=147, correct.\n\na_5=3*(1 + a_4)=444, correct.\n\na_6=3*(1 + a_5)=1335, correct.\n\na_7=3*(1 + a_6)=4008, correct.\n\na_8=3*(1 + a_7)=12027, correct.\n\na_9=3*(1 + a_8)=36084, correct.\n\nSo, a_9=36084 is correct.\n\nBut in the step-by-step computation, Level9=29524.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels in the step-by-step method. Let me try to parse the original expression again, counting the number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer1=4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, layer2=1+3*4=13, layer3=1+3*13=40, etc., up to layer9=1+3*(layer8)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, a_9=36084, which would make the entire expression "

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the innermost part is the last expression, which is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that part is straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, then this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Hmm, so that level gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving another level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So now I have 40 at this level.\n\nContinuing this way, the next level is 1 + 3 times 40. So, 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. That's the next result. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So now I'm at 364.\n\nNext, the expression becomes 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives me 1093. \n\nContinuing outward, the next term is 1 + 3*1093. Let's see, 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. \n\nThen, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, and adding 1 gives 9841. \n\nNext, the expression is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. \n\nNow, moving out to the next level, it's 1 + 3*29524. Calculating that: 3*29524 is 88572, and adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3 times that result, so 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573. Hmm, 80,000 times 3 is 240,000, 8,000 times 3 is 24,000, 500 times 3 is 1,500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me just multiply 88573 by 3 properly.\n\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 is 9.\n3*7 is 21, carry over 2.\n3*5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, carry over 1.\n3*8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, carry over 2.\n3*8 is 24, plus the carried 2 is 26.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 3*88573 is 265,719. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, there are no more digits, so the carry over 2 becomes the next digit. So the result is 265,719. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. Let me compute 88573 * 3:\n\n80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n70 * 3 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding these up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nYes, that matches. So 3*88573 is indeed 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each step because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the number of levels to make sure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nWait, so that's 10 levels, right? Because the original expression has 9 opening parentheses, each with a 1+3(...), so maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a new level, so let's count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So when I computed up to 88573, that was the 9th level, right? So then the outermost 3 times that gives me 265,719. So that would be correct.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Let me go through each level again:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, wait a second, in my initial calculation, I went up to 88573, but now when recounting, I'm getting 29524 at level 9. That means I must have made a mistake earlier because I thought level 9 was 88573, but according to this recount, it's 29524.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I messed up the counting earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me list each step with the correct level number:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's different from my initial calculation. So I think I made a mistake earlier by counting one too many levels. Let me see. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1+3. So the number of levels inside is 9, each adding another 1+3(...). So the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of level 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572, not 265,719 as I previously thought.\n\nWait, so that means I made a mistake in my initial counting, thinking there were 10 levels, but actually, there are 9 levels inside the outermost 3. So let me correct that.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that correctly.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial 265,719. So I think I had an error in the number of levels earlier. So the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I'm getting conflicting results. Let me recount the number of levels.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" is a new level. Let's count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(...)\". Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis, so let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen each level adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before the closing parentheses start. So that would mean there are 9 levels inside, each adding another 1+3(...). Therefore, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the 9th level, which is 29524, giving 88,572.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering one extra level, which was incorrect. Therefore, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this again. Let me write out each step clearly, ensuring that I don't miscount the levels.\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So I think I initially miscounted the levels, thinking there were 10, but it's actually 9 levels inside the outermost 3. So the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it.\n\nEach level seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let me check that. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nYes, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d.\n\nIn this case, c = 3 and d = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (d/(c-1))*(c^n - 1) + (a_0)*(c^{n}).\n\nWait, actually, let me recall the formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*c^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say K.\n\nSo, substituting into the equation: K = c*K + d => K - c*K = d => K*(1 - c) = d => K = d/(1 - c)\n\nBut in our case, c = 3, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n starts at 1, so when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 levels inside the outermost 3. So, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost inside is level 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think earlier I mistakenly thought there were 10 levels, which led me to an incorrect result. By correctly counting the levels and using the recurrence relation, I arrive at 88,572. Let me just double-check the multiplication to be absolutely sure.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by evaluating the innermost part and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, the outermost expression:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me try to write down the expression in a way that shows the layers clearly. So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out one layer, it's (1 + 3*(previous result)), and so on. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Let me see: the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps it's 9 layers deep? Let me check:\n\n1. The innermost layer is (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from layer 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2)\n4. And so on, until we get to layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, actually, when I look again, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, the entire expression is 3 times (something), and that something is 1 + 3 times another similar expression. So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), and inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), and so on, for a total of 8 times? Or maybe 9? Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, after the initial 3*, we have a (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count how many times the 3*(...) occurs. Starting from the first 3*, then each (1 + 3*(...)) is another layer. So, starting with 3*(...), then inside that, another 3*(...), and so on until the innermost part is (1 + 3). So, how many layers is that? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*: There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a (1 + 3*(...)) layer. So, that would make 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Wait, no, because the initial 3* is outside the first (1 + 3*(...)). So, the total number of layers inside the first 3* is 8, because each (1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me denote each layer as a function of the previous one. Let's define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1)\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2)\n...\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, if I compute f(1) through f(9), then multiply by 3, I'll have the answer. That seems manageable. Let me try to compute each f(n) step by step.\n\nStarting with f(1):\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error with so many layers.\n\nLet me go through each f(n) again:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2705\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13 \u2705\n\nf(3)=1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2705\n\nf(4)=1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2705\n\nf(5)=1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2705\n\nf(6)=1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2705\n\nf(7)=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2705\n\nf(8)=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2705\n\nf(9)=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2705\n\nThen, 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572 \u2705\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this without computing each step, just to confirm.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this.\n\nIn this case, each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let me try to find C.\n\nAssuming f(n) = A*3^n + C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + C)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + C\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3C +1\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + C = A*3^n + 3C +1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nC = 3C +1\n\nThen, -2C =1 => C= -1/2\n\nHmm, so f(n) = A*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A=4.5/3=1.5=3/2\n\nSo, f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2\n\nSimplify: f(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2\n\nSo, f(9)= (3^10 -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^10 again to be sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by defining a recursive function \\(f(n)\\) where each term is built from the previous one.\n\n1.

Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time, so maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula.\n\nLet me think. Each layer can be represented as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut maybe I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 3\n\n-2*a_p = 3\n\na_p = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 5.5 = 3A, so A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nBut perhaps it's better to keep it as (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, compute 19683 / 6:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute that.\n\n3280 * 11 = 36,080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5\n\nThen, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step calculation I did earlier. So, that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), and starting from 4, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 3. So, perhaps another way to compute this is to recognize the pattern and find a formula.\n\nBut since I already have the result as 36,084 from both methods, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations because sometimes when I'm dealing with large exponents, I might make a mistake.\n\nSo, let's verify 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, (11/6)*19683: 19683 divided by 6 is indeed 3280.5, and 3280.5 times 11 is 36,085.5. Subtracting 1.5 gives 36,084.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nI think that's the answer. It seems a bit large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 each time, the numbers grow exponentially, so it makes sense.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n- Each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\n- After 9 layers, the result is 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the inner layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, each layer's result is calculated step by step until the outermost layer is reached. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, the final result is found to be 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outwards. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part of the expression, which is the last (1+3). Let me write down each step as I go along. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a (1+...), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1+...), so let's see: starting from the left, it's 3(1+3(1+3(...)))). So, each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me count the number of times this happens. Let me see: starting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s after each opening parenthesis. Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of nested terms. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me denote the innermost term as a starting point. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say that each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 is the innermost term. But wait, how many layers are there? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach time, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. Let me count the number of 3s. Wait, no, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers of nesting. Let me check:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), then\n2. Next layer is 3*(1 + that result),\n3. Then 3*(1 + that result), and so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me write this down step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. So, the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1+3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3*(1 + result from step 1). So that's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nStep 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 3*(1 + result from step 2). So that's 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nStep 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nNext layer out: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nStep 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nStep 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nStep 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nStep 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nStep 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check how many steps I've taken. I started with the innermost as step 1, then each step after that is moving outward. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of times we have 3(1+3(...)). Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 indicates a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, then inside that, another 3(1+...), and so on. Let me count the number of times this occurs.\n\nEach time, the structure is 3(1 + ...), so starting from the first 3, the next is another 3(1+...), and so on until we reach the innermost (1+3). Let me see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of 3s inside the expression, but actually, each layer adds a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers as the number of times we have 3(1+3(...)). Let me see: starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside the previous one. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3 followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- And this continues until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times I see \"3(\" in the expression. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time I see a 3 followed by a (, that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times, right? So, the innermost is the 9th layer. So, I think I have 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost. So, in my previous calculation, I went up to 9 layers, ending with 36084. So, is that the final answer? Wait, but when I counted the steps earlier, I ended up with 36084 as the 9th step. So, perhaps that's the correct answer.\n\nBut let me verify this again, step by step, to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me start over, writing down each step clearly.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next layer out is 3*(1 + result from Step 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nStep 3: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nStep 4: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nStep 5: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nStep 6: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nStep 7: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nStep 8: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nStep 9: Next layer is 3*(1 + result from Step 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check again, because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might have miscounted the layers or made a multiplication error. Let me go through each step again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. The multiplications and additions all check out. So, I think 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each step manually, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer can be represented recursively as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 is the innermost term, which is 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = k*(1 + a_{n-1}), where k is a constant. In this case, k=3.\n\nThis type of recurrence can be solved by expanding it:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSimilarly, a_{n-1} = 3 + 3*a_{n-2}, so substituting back:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*a_{n-2} = 3 + 9 + 9*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, we can see a pattern emerging where each term adds 3^{m} * a_{n-m} plus a sum of 3^{m} terms.\n\nAlternatively, we can recognize that this is a geometric series. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a_1.\n\nStarting from a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3 + 3*a_2 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_1) = 3 + 9 + 9*a_1.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3 + 3*a_3 = 3 + 3*(3 + 9 + 9*a_1) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*a_1.\n\nI see a pattern here: each a_n can be expressed as 3^{n} - 1 + 3^{n}*a_1.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 3 + 3*a_1 = 3*(1 + a_1).\n\na_3 = 3 + 3*a_2 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_1) = 3 + 9 + 9*a_1 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^2*a_1.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to fit exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the recurrence relation.\n\nWe have a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3*1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*(1 + B).\n\nWait, that can't be right, because if we plug B into the equation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), we get:\n\nB = 3*(1 + B).\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 3 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-B = 3.\n\nSo, B = -3.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-3).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3) => 4 = 3A - 3 => 3A = 7 => A = 7/3.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (7/3)*3^n - 3 = 7*3^{n-1} - 3.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3^n times (7/3) is 7*3^{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_n = 7*3^{n-1} - 3.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = 7*3^{0} - 3 = 7*1 - 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = 7*3^{1} - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 15. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nWait, in the problem, each a_n is defined as 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nLet me try to model this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model it as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which gives r = 3, so homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 3, we can try a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nP = 3 + 3*P.\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3P = 3 => -2P = 3 => P = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - (3/2) = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (3/2) = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct, as per earlier computation.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (11/6)*3^3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - (3/2) = (99/2) - (3/2) = 96/2 = 48. Correct again.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers are there? Earlier, I thought it was 9 layers because of the number of 3s, but let me confirm.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time we have a 3 followed by (1 + ...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 inside adds a layer. Let's count the number of times we have \"3(\" in the expression.\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, meaning n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\n19683 divided by 6 is 3280.5, multiplied by 11: 3280.5 * 11.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3280 * 11 = 36,080.\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5.\n\nSo, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5.\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Let me see:\n\nStarting from the end, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps around that with another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of layers. From the expression, I can see that there are nine layers. Let me confirm:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. Then: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n... and so on, up to nine layers. Wait, actually, let me check: each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...), and each \"...\" is another similar expression. So the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps there are nine such layers? Or maybe eight? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Let's define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define E_n as the expression with n layers. So E_1 would be 3*(1 + 3). Then E_2 would be 3*(1 + E_1), E_3 would be 3*(1 + E_2), and so on, up to E_9, which would be the entire expression.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"3(\" after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo each \"3*(1 + \" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) \u2013 that's the first layer.\n2. Then inside, another 3*(1 + ... ), so that's the second.\n3. Continuing, up to the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, maybe it's 9 layers? Let me check: starting from the innermost, (1 + 3). Then each time we go out, we add another 3*(1 + ...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + ... ), so perhaps the total expression is Layer9, which would be 36084. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it step by step, calculating each layer one by one.\n\nWait, let me try to compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + result from Step1). So that's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nStep3: Next layer out: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nStep4: Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nStep5: Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nStep6: Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nStep7: Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nStep8: Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nStep9: Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo after nine steps, the final result is 36,084. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So the final answer should be 36,084. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to represent this without computing each step, to confirm.\n\nI notice that each step is of the form E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), where E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1})\n\nWe can expand this:\n\nE_n = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), let's try a constant particular solution E_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2\n\nSo the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, E_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nC = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general formula is E_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\nE_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, so:\n\nE_n = (11/6)*3*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2:\n\nE_n = (1/2)*(11*3^{n-1} - 3)\n\nNow, let's compute E_9 using this formula.\n\nE_9 = (1/2)*(11*3^{8} - 3)\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561\n\nSo, E_9 = (1/2)*(11*6561 - 3) = (1/2)*(72171 - 3) = (1/2)*72168 = 36084\n\nYes, that matches the step-by-step computation. So the final answer is indeed 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the formula, let me compute E_1 using the formula:\n\nE_1 = (1/2)*(11*3^{0} - 3) = (1/2)*(11*1 - 3) = (1/2)*(8) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_2 = (1/2)*(11*3^1 - 3) = (1/2)*(33 - 3) = (1/2)*30 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_3 = (1/2)*(11*3^2 - 3) = (1/2)*(99 - 3) = (1/2)*96 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_4 = (1/2)*(11*3^3 - 3) = (1/2)*(297 - 3) = (1/2)*294 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so the formula works for the first few terms, so I'm confident it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nBy evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression evaluates to 36,084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let me try that approach.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, I can see that the innermost part is (1+3). So, let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write that down. The next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. \n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that. 3*13 is 39, and then adding 1 gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this process, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me do that. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. \n\nMoving on, the next layer is 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that. 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives me 1093. \n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*1093. Calculating that, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. \n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let me work that out. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. \n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. So, 3*9841 is... let me see, 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. \n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 9841*3. Maybe I should do it digit by digit to be accurate. \n\n9841\nx  3\n------\n(1*3)=3\n(4*3)=12, carryover 1\n(8*3)=24 +1 =25, carryover 2\n(9*3)=27 +2=29\nSo, 29523. Yes, that's correct. So, 29523 +1 is 29524. \n\nOkay, so that layer is 29524. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, 88,572. \n\nThen, adding 1 gives me 88,573. \n\nWait, let me confirm that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n29,524 * 3:\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, yes, 88,572. Adding 1, it's 88,573. \n\nSo, the next layer is 88,573. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*88,573. Let me compute that. 3*88,573. Let's do this step by step.\n\n88,573 * 3:\n3*3=9, write down 9.\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2.\nBut wait, 88,573 is a 5-digit number, so I think I might have messed up the place values. Let me write it correctly:\n\n88,573\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3=9\n3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2\n3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2\nBut wait, after the first digit, we've already gone through all the digits, so the carryover 2 would be added as a new digit on the left. So, the result is 265,719. \n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\n88,573 * 3:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2\n3*5 = 15 +2 =17, write 7, carryover 1\n3*8 =24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carryover 2\nSo, after the last digit, we have a carryover of 2, which becomes the next digit to the left. So, the result is 265,719. \n\nSo, 3*88,573 is 265,719. Adding 1 gives me 265,720. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*265,720. Let me compute that. \n\n3*265,720.

Adding 1 gives me 797,161. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*797,161. Let me compute that. \n\n3*797,161. Let me break this down:\n\n797,161 * 3:\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write 8, carryover 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, write 1, carryover 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2\n7*3=21 +2=23, write 3, carryover 2\nSo, the result is 2,391,483. \n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n797,161\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write 8, carryover 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, write 1, carryover 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2\n7*3=21 +2=23, write 3, carryover 2\nBut since we're at the leftmost digit, we add the carryover 2 to get 23. So, writing it out, it's 2,391,483. \n\nSo, 3*797,161 is 2,391,483. Adding 1 gives me 2,391,484. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*2,391,484. Let me compute that. \n\n3*2,391,484. Let me break this down:\n\n2,391,484 * 3:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n4*3=12 +2=14, write 4, carryover 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2\n3*3=9 +2=11, write 1, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\nSo, the result is 7,174,452. \n\nWait, let me verify that step by step:\n\n2,391,484\nx       3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n4*3=12 +2=14, write 4, carryover 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2\n3*3=9 +2=11, write 1, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\nSo, writing it out, it's 7,174,452. \n\nSo, 3*2,391,484 is 7,174,452. Adding 1 gives me 7,174,453. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*7,174,453. Let me compute that. \n\n3*7,174,453. Let me break this down:\n\n7,174,453 * 3:\n3*3=9\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1\n7*3=21 +1=22, write 2, carryover 2\n1*3=3 +2=5\n7*3=21, write 1, carryover 2\nSo, the result is 21,523,359. \n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n7,174,453\nx        3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3=9\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1\n4*3=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1\n7*3=21 +1=22, write 2, carryover 2\n1*3=3 +2=5\n7*3=21, write 1, carryover 2\nBut wait, the number is 7,174,453, which is 7,174,453. So, let me count the digits correctly:\n\nStarting from the right:\nDigit 1: 3\nDigit 2: 5\nDigit 3: 4\nDigit 4: 4\nDigit 5: 7\nDigit 6: 1\nDigit 7: 7\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n3*3=9\n3*5=15, write 5, carryover 1\n3*4=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1\n3*4=12 +1=13, write 3, carryover 1\n3*7=21 +1=22, write 2, carryover 2\n3*1=3 +2=5\n3*7=21, write 1, carryover 2\nBut since we're at the end, the carryover 2 becomes a new digit on the left. So, the result is 21,523,359. \n\nSo, 3*7,174,453 is 21,523,359. Adding 1 gives me 21,523,360. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*21,523,360. Let me compute that. \n\n3*21,523,360.

Adding 1 gives me 64,569,081. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*64,569,081. Let me compute that. \n\n3*64,569,081.

    "text": " Let me try to write it out more clearly.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level is 13. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, maybe I can think of this as a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to define it that way. Let's say that for each level n, the value is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 is the innermost expression. In this case, since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think that means there are nine levels. Wait, actually, when I count the parentheses, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another level. Let me check: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does the 1 + 3 appear? Let me count: each opening parenthesis after the first 3 starts a new 1+3 term. Let me see: from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each time I go out one level, I add another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is the first level, then each subsequent level adds another 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs, it's 9 times. So, maybe I can compute each level step by step, from level 1 to level 9, and then multiply the outermost 3 at the end. Hmm, that sounds manageable.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let's define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Continuing this way, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. \n\nWait, so a_9 is 29524. But the original expression is 3*(a_9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3*29,524. Let me compute it step by step:\n\nFirst, 3*20,000 = 60,000.\n\nThen, 3*9,000 = 27,000. So, 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\nThen, 3*500 = 1,500. So, 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72. So, 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so 3*29,524 is 88,572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating a_9. Let me go back through each step to check for errors.\n\nStarting with a_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 is 88,572. So, that's the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} can be solved using the formula a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, but wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the standard form for such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. Wait, no, in our problem, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, where a_0 would be 1? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the indices.\n\nWait, in our case, a_1 is 4, which comes from 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps the initial term is a_1 = 4, and then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, to solve this recurrence, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is built up by multiplying by 3 each time, so the expression a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be seen as a sum of terms where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nBut I think the way I did it before is correct. So, to sum up, the expression simplifies step by step as I computed, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1.

Continue this process for each subsequent level:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The result of the innermost expression after 9 levels is \\(29524\\).\n\n5. Multiply this result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to parse this expression step by step. Let me write it out more clearly, maybe starting from the innermost part and working my way out. So, the innermost part is (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by that expression. Let me count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that suggests there are nine layers. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me check again. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time we have 3 times (1+3(...)). So, perhaps it's 8 layers? Wait, maybe I should just work from the inside out, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression and work our way outwards. The innermost part is (1+3). So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, the next layer out is 3 times that result. So, 3*(1+3) = 3*4 = 12. But wait, actually, no, because the next layer is 1 + 3*(the previous result). Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try again. The innermost expression is (1+3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer out is 3*(13), right? Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. Let me write each step down.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define the innermost part as E1, then E2, up to E9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Let me define each layer step by step.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(E9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I did that correctly because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting with E1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the layers correctly. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as each time we have a new layer. So, E1 to E9 as I did before.\n\nWait, but when I calculated E9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check using a different approach. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without calculating each layer manually.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\nE_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nYes, that's correct because (3^{n+1}/2 - 1/2) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for E_n, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the answer. Wait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time we have a new \"1+3(\", so let me count:\n\nStarting with the innermost, it's (1+3). Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nFrom the inside:\n\n(1+3) is the innermost.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me check by expanding:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1+3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1+3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nE3 =1 +3*E2 =40\n\nE4=121\n\nE5=364\n\nE6=1093\n\nE7=3280\n\nE8=9841\n\nE9=29524\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, so E9 is 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should compute it step by step again, just to confirm.\n\nStarting with E1 =4\n\nE2=1+3*4=13\n\nE3=1+3*13=40\n\nE4=1+3*40=121\n\nE5=1+3*121=364\n\nE6=1+3*364=1093\n\nE7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so E9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). The innermost term is (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Evaluate Innermost Layer**:\n   - E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Evaluate Subsequent Layers**:\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is the last 1+3. So, let me write down each step as I go outward. Let's start by looking at the innermost expression:\n\n1. The innermost part is 1+3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that:\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now that inner expression is 13. Moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that:\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that:\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right. Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Let's do that:\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n364? That seems a bit big, but okay, let's keep going. Next level out is 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that:\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's getting large. Let me check my calculations so far to make sure I haven't messed up. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n\n2. 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\n3. 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\n4. 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\n5. 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\n6. 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Now, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that:\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, right? 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. That seems correct.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that:\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, 3*3280. Let me verify that. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. That's correct.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Calculating that:\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3*9841. Let me check: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that:\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, 3*29524. Let me verify: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step builds on the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Let me list all the steps again to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the result we just computed, which is 88573. So, the final step is to multiply 88573 by 3.\n\n11. 3*88573 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 88573*3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n80000*3 = 240000\n\n8000*3 = 24000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n70*3 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding them together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nWait, so 88573*3 is 265719.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 88573*3 digit by digit:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\n3*0 (since there's nothing beyond 88573, it's just 2 carried over) 2.\n\nSo, writing it together: 265719.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 265719.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of steps. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(...\n2. 3(...\n3. 3(...\n4. 3(...\n5. 3(...\n6. 3(...\n7. 3(...\n8. 3(...\n9. 3(...\n10. 3(...))\n\nWait, so there are 9 sets of parentheses inside each other, right? So, starting from the innermost, which is the 10th layer, and working outwards, each step corresponds to one of those layers. So, when I did the steps from 1 to 10, I think I went through all the layers, ending up with 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost 1+3, which is step 1, then each subsequent step adds another layer until step 9, which would be the 9th layer, and then step 10 would be the outermost multiplication by 3. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number the layers differently. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1+3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). So, each layer is a 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10 result) = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 265719.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, subtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the result is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), so the innermost is layer 1, up to layer 9, which gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier at step 9.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier I got 88573. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the counting.\n\nWait, wait, let me think again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(, there's a 1+3(, so starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 1+3( adds a layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. The first 1+3 is at the innermost level, then each layer adds another 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers of 1+3 inside each other. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, each time adding another 1+3(...).\n\nTherefore, the result after 9 layers is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 88573 before multiplying by 3. Wait, that must have been a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my step-by-step computation, I went from 1+3=4, then up to 1+3*29524=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nBut according to the closed-form formula, the inner expression after 9 layers is 29524, so 3*29524=88572, not 88573. So, there's a discrepancy here, which means I must have made an error in my step-by-step calculation.\n\nLet me go back and check each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Wait, but according to the closed-form formula, after 9 layers, it's 29524, so this step 10 would be an additional layer, making it 10 layers, but the original problem only has 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original problem.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( adds a new layer.\n\nSo, let's count the opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(...\n\n9. 1+3(1+3\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3 inside, meaning that the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the result after 9 layers is 29524, as per the closed-form formula. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, which would imply 10 layers, which isn't the case. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me see: each time I did a step, I was going one layer deeper, but perhaps I should have stopped at 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. 1+3=4 (layer 1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*4=13 (layer 2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*13=40 (layer 3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*40=121 (layer 4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*121=364 (layer 5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*364=1093 (layer 6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093=3280 (layer 7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280=9841 (layer 8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841=29524 (layer 9)\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went one more layer, which would be layer 10, but that's not part of the original problem. So, I must have made a mistake by going one step too far.\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I had 88573 before multiplying by 3. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many 1+3(...) are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each time you have 1+3 followed by another set of parentheses.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n\n- Then, one level out: 1+3(1+3)\n\n- Next level: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers of 1+3 inside each other.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more 1+3( expressions. Let me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 1+3(\n\n2. 1+3(\n\n3. 1+3(\n\n4. 1+3(\n\n5. 1+3(\n\n6. 1+3(\n\n7. 1+3(\n\n8. 1+3(\n\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n3( ( ... ) )\n\nEach time, there's a 1+3(, which opens another set of parentheses.\n\nSo, let me count the number of 1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n\n2. 1+3(1+3(\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(\n\n9. 1+3(1+3\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of 1+3(, meaning 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 9, and the outermost is layer 1.\n\nWait, that would mean that when I did my step-by-step, I went from layer 1 to layer 9, resulting in 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I had 88573 before multiplying by 3, which would be incorrect. Therefore, the correct final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my step-by-step again. I think I went one layer too deep because I miscounted.\n\nWait, when I started, I did 1+3=4 (layer 1), then 1+3*4=13 (layer 2), up to 1+3*9841=29524 (layer 9). So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 1+3*29524=88573, which is layer 10, which isn't part of the problem. So, that was a mistake. Therefore, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572, not 265719 as I previously thought. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by going one layer too deep.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 4\n\n2. 13\n\n3. 40\n\n4. 121\n\n5. 364\n\n6. 1093\n\n7. 3280\n\n8. 9841\n\n9. 29524\n\n10. 88573\n\nBut according to the problem, there are only 9 layers, so step 10 is incorrect. Therefore, the correct final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because in my step-by-step, I thought I was correctly following each layer, but perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of layers again by looking at the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(, there's a 1+3(, which starts a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 1+3(\n\n2. 1+3(\n\n3. 1+3(\n\n4. 1+3(\n\n5. 1+3(\n\n6. 1+3(\n\n7. 1+3(\n\n8. 1+3(\n\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of 1+3(, so there are 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 9, which is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result).\n\nSo, layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, the value is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 1+3*29524=88573, which would be layer 10, which isn't present in the problem. Therefore, that was a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with the closed-form formula. For n=9 layers, a_n=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_n=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the number of layers, thinking there were 10 layers instead of 9. Therefore, I mistakenly computed one extra layer, leading to the wrong final answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time stopping at layer 9.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, leading me to an incorrect final answer. Now, by carefully recounting and using the closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward.\n\n1. The innermost expression is \\( 1 + 3 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, we evaluate \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, we evaluate \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next, we evaluate \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next, we evaluate \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next, we evaluate \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next, we evaluate \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next, we evaluate \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9.

The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to parse this expression step by step.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 times (something). That something is 1 plus 3 times another expression, which is also 1 plus 3 times another, and so on. Let me write it out more clearly to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Hmm, let me see: the innermost part is 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1, then multiplied by 3 again, and so on. So, maybe I can compute this by starting from the inside and working my way out. Let me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4.\n\n2. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Then: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 9). So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Hmm, 29524 times 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, it's 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer builds up as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4.\n\n2. Next: 1+3*4=13.\n\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40.\n\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121.\n\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364.\n\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093.\n\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, the total result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each step again.\n\n1. 1+3=4. Correct.\n\n2. 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\n3. 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\n4. 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\n5. 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\n6. 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, right? Yes, because 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1092+1=1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1+3*1093: 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279+1=3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1+3*3280: 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840+1=9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1+3*9841: 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 29523+1=29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to make sure. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, I did 9 steps, each time computing the next layer out. Then, the outermost 3*(...) would be the 10th step. Wait, no, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with how many 1+3 layers? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count them.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each time adding another layer. So, when I computed the innermost as step 1, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent step adds another layer, so step 1: 1 layer, step 2: 2 layers, up to step 9: 9 layers. Then, the outermost 3*(...) would be step 10, which is 3 times the 9-layer result. So, my earlier computation was correct: 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, each step from 1 to 9 corresponds to each layer, and step 10 is the final multiplication by 3. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote a_n as the value after n layers, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using the method for such recursions. The general solution is a_n = (a_0 - c/(r-1)) * r^n + c/(r-1). Wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. In our case, c=1, r=3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait, in our case, a_1 is the first term after one layer, which is 4. But in the recurrence, n starts at 1, so maybe the initial condition is a_0? Let me check.\n\nWait, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, using the general solution:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, that's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each a_n.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that:\n\n3*( (59049 -1)/2 )=3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is much faster and less error-prone.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula, the innermost part is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147.\n\nThen, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. So, that's another way to compute it directly, giving the same result.\n\nThis confirms that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think I've got it right. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression, which is a series of 1 + 3*(...) repeated 9 times, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, moving outward, each time computing the value of the current layer and substituting it into the next outer layer.\n\n3. Alternatively, model the expression as a recurrence relation, solve it to find a closed-form formula, and then compute the result using the formula, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\n4. Verify the result using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, ensuring consistency.\n\n5. Finally, compute the outermost multiplication by 3, arriving at the final answer.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each step and verifying my calculations, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression, which is a series of repeated terms of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{another similar expression})\\). We can compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer out:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and working my way out. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me assign each level a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, level 1 is (1 + 3), level 2 is 3*(1 + result of level 1), and so on, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then wrapping it all in another 3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, the structure is that each term is 3*(1 + next term). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each level one by one.\n\nStarting with level 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, level 2: 3*(1 + level1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + level2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + level3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + level4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + level5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + level6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + level7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + level8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so does that mean that the outermost 3 is applied to the entire level9 result? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, because the way it's written, each level is 3*(1 + next level). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + previous step). So, perhaps I've already included all nine levels, and the final result is 36084. But let me double-check because I might have miscounted the levels.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's one set, then each next set adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many levels are there? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n10. Then, the outermost 3: 3*(36084) = 108252\n\nWait, did I miss a level? Because in my initial count, I thought there were nine levels, but now it seems like after nine steps, we have 36084, and then another 3* that, making it 108252. So, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of 3(...) terms: Let's see, starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each 3 is inside. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of times the pattern \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). So, the number of times this occurs is 9 times, as each \"1 + 3(\" is a new level. So, maybe the innermost is level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(result of level 9). So, 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, so that would make the total number of levels 10? But in the original expression, I think the count is 9. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write it as a sequence, each step building on the previous one.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is computed as 3*(1 + previous term). So, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet\u2019s define a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na3 = 3*(1 + a2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na4 = 3*(1 + a3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na5 = 3*(1 + a4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na6 = 3*(1 + a5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na7 = 3*(1 + a6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na8 = 3*(1 + a7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na9 = 3*(1 + a8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\na10 = 3*(1 + a9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... in the expression.\n\nStarting from the left, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ... starting from the first one after the initial 3.\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ... So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another 3*(1 + ... So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, (1 + 3), then each 3*(1 + ... So, the number of 3*(1 + ... is 9, right? Because after the initial 3*(, there are 9 more 3*(1 + ... So, that would mean that after the initial 3, we have 9 more levels. So, that would make a total of 10 levels, including the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to a10 as 108255, but perhaps that's not correct because maybe the initial 3 is the first level, and then each subsequent 3*(1 + ... is the next level.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the outermost 3 is applied to the result of the innermost expression. So, perhaps the initial 3 is the first level, then each inner 3 is a subsequent level. Let me try again.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one level: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext level: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nSo, that's 9 steps after the innermost (1 + 3). So, the outermost 3 is applied to 36084, giving 108255.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so the initial 3 is the first level, and then each inner 3 is another level. So, perhaps there are 9 levels after the initial 3. Let me check the count again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the initial 3 is considered a level or not. Let me try to write down the expression with each level:\n\nLevel 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nBut the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each level is 3*(1 + previous level). So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nLevel 10: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255\n\nSo, the expression is built up to level 10, which would be the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the final result would be 108255.\n\nWait, but when I first calculated up to level 9 as 36084, then applying the outermost 3 would give 108252, but in this step-by-step, I have level 10 as 108255. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, let me recast this. Perhaps I'm miscounting the number of levels. Let's try to write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next level out is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nStep 3: Next level out is 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nStep 4: Next level out is 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nStep 5: Next level out is 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nStep 6: Next level out is 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nStep 7: Next level out is 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nStep 8: Next level out is 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nStep 9: Next level out is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nStep 10: Finally, the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, so that's 10 steps, but in the original problem, how many nested 3*(1 + ...) are there? Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + appears in the expression.\n\nStarting from the left, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3*(1 +, there are 9 more 3*(1 + ... So, that would imply that there are 9 levels inside, making the total levels 10, including the outermost one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial 3 is not part of the count. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3 is the first level, and then each inner 3 is another level. So, the initial 3 is level 1, and then each subsequent 3*(1 + ... is level 2, 3, etc. So, in that case, how many levels do we have?\n\nLet me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3*(1 + ...). Then, inside that, there's another 3*(1 + ...), and so on, nine times.\n\nSo, the number of 3*(1 + ... terms is 9, starting from the first one after the initial 3.\n\nWait, so perhaps the initial 3 is level 1, and then each inner 3 is another level, up to level 10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each step carefully, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me write down each step with the result:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next level: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next level: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next level: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next level: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next level: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next level: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next level: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next level: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\n10. Next level: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nSo, after 10 levels, we reach 108255. But in the original problem, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3*(1 +, each subsequent 3*(1 + is a new level. So, let's count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) \u2013 this is level 1.\n\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1 + ...)) \u2013 level 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many levels? Let's see, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+, each 3(1+ is a new level. Let's count the number of 3(1+:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 level 1\n\nThen, inside that, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 level 2\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). So, how many 3(1+ are there? Let's count:\n\n- The first 3(1+ is level 1.\n\n- Then, inside that, another 3(1+ is level 2.\n\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is level 9.\n\nWait, so perhaps there are 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...), making the total number of levels 9, each corresponding to a step. So, then the final result after 9 steps would be 36084, and then the outermost 3 is applied, making it 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 10 levels, but now I'm seeing 9 levels. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3 is considered a level or not. Let me try to write down the expression with each level clearly.\n\nLet me define the expression as follows:\n\nE = 3*(1 + E1)\n\nWhere E1 = 3*(1 + E2)\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E3)\n\nAnd so on, until E9 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, but that can't be right because E9 would be 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then E8 would be 3*(1 + 12) = 39, and so on. But that seems different from my earlier approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misdefining the levels. Let me try to define it recursively.\n\nLet me define E(n) as the expression with n levels. So, E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + E(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + E(4)) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + E(5)) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + E(6)) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + E(7)) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nE(9) = 3*(1 + E(8)) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but this approach is giving me a different result. Hmm. So, perhaps I'm miscounting the levels. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I'm starting E(1) as 3*(1 + 3), but in the original problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then each level is 3*(1 + previous level). So, perhaps E(n) is defined as 3*(1 + E(n-1)), starting from E(1) = 4.\n\nWait, no, because E(1) would be the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*5 = 15, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me try that.\n\nSo, define E(1) = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + E(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + E(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + E(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + E(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + E(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nE(9) = 3*(1 + E(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nE(10) = 3*(1 + E(9)) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255\n\nSo, if E(n) represents the value after n levels, then E(10) would be 108255.\n\nBut in the original problem, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... terms.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3*(1 + is level 1, then inside that, another 3*(1 + is level 2, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many levels is that?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(...\n\nSo, each time a new ( appears, it's a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 1 opening parenthesis.\n\nBut wait, each 3(1+... has its own opening parenthesis. So, perhaps each 3(1+... is a new level.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of levels is equal to the number of 3(1+... terms. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...), that's level 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 3(1+3(...), level 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). So, how many 3(1+... terms are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 level 1\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 level 2\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). Let's see, each time we have a 3(1+... So, let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears after the first one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times \"3(\" occurs in the expression, excluding the first 3.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the number of times \"3(\" appears is 9, because after the first 3, each subsequent \"3(\" is part of a new level. Let me confirm:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+, each subsequent 3(1+ is a new level. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first one.\n\nLooking at the string: \"3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nThe first \"3(\" is at the beginning. Then, each subsequent \"3(\" is inside. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1+...\n\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many \"3(\" are there in total? Let me count:\n\n- The first 3( is the outermost.\n\n- Then, inside that, another 3(, so that's 2.\n\n- Then another 3(, making it 3.\n\n- Continue until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach time we have a \"(\", it's a new level. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", after the initial 3, each \"(\" corresponds to a new level.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, the first \"(\" is at position 2: 3(1+3(... So, that's 1.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another \"(\", so that's 2.\n\n3. Continuing, each time we have a \"(\", that's a new level.\n\nSo, how many \"(\" are there after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first \"(\", after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(... \u2013 1\n\n2. (1+3(... \u2013 2\n\n3. (1+3(... \u2013 3\n\n4. (1+3(... \u2013 4\n\n5. (1+3(... \u2013 5\n\n6. (1+3(... \u2013 6\n\n7. (1+3(... \u2013 7\n\n8. (1+3(... \u2013 8\n\n9. (1+3(... \u2013 9\n\nThen, the innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th \"(\", so that would correspond to 9 levels.\n\nTherefore, the number of levels is 9, meaning that E(9) = 36084, and then the outermost 3 is applied, making it 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did E(10) = 108255, that was based on starting E(1) as the innermost (1 + 3). So, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3 is part of the level count or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the original expression, the outermost 3 is applied to the result of 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...). So, the computation would be:\n\nCompute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nSo, that's 9 levels after the innermost (1 + 3). Therefore, the result of the innermost expression is 36084, and then the outermost 3 is applied, giving 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to E(9) = 36084, and then E(10) = 108255, but perhaps that's incorrect because in the original expression, the outermost 3 is only applied once, after computing the inner expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by including the outermost 3 as an additional level. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nSo, the inner expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 9 levels, and then the outermost 3 is applied to the entire result.\n\nWait, but actually, the way it's written, each 3*(1 + ... is a separate level, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each step out is 3*(1 + previous result). So, after 9 steps, we reach 36084, and then the outermost 3 is applied, giving 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of it as E(n), I considered E(1) = 4, E(2) = 15, up to E(9) = 36084, and then the outermost 3 is applied, giving 108252.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had E(10) = 108255, which seems to be an error because that would imply that there are 10 levels, but in the original problem, there are only 9 levels inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the levels.\n\nLet me write down the expression with each level clearly indicated:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after 9 levels, we reach 36084.\n\nThen, the outermost 3 is applied to this result: 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a different result when I included an extra level, which was incorrect. So, I think the correct approach is to compute 9 levels, each being 3*(1 + previous result), starting from (1 + 3) = 4, leading to 36084, and then applying the outermost 3 to get 108252.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the initial 3 is part of the first level, making it 10 levels in total, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to recognize that the expression is a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nEach term is 3*(1 + previous term), which can be represented as a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant"

Let's count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(... So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by something, and that something is 1 + 3 times another something. Let me see how many layers there are. Let's count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The outermost 3\n2. Then inside that, another 3\n3. Then another 3\n4. Then another 3\n5. Then another 3\n6. Then another 3\n7. Then another 3\n8. Then another 3\n9. Then another 3\n10. Finally, the innermost 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me check that again. Each time, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, there's a \"(\", so:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(\n2. Then another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n3. Another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n4. Another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n5. Another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n6. Another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n7.

Wait, but each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each layer before that adds another multiplication by 3. So, if there are 9 layers, I might need to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost and working outward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can define a recursive function or find a pattern.\n\nLet me try to define each layer as a term. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Wait, no, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, it's 3*a_9. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that seems right. Let me try to compute each a_n step by step.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4.\n2. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is a_2.\n3. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*a_9, so the final result would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers to make sure.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, starting from the innermost.\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, so that's the first layer.\n2. Then, moving outward, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", so a_1 to a_9.\n\nWait, but when I computed a_9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that each a_n is correctly computed.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2. Then each subsequent ( is after each 3. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(\n2. Then another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n3. Another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n4. Another ( after 3: (1 + 3(\n5.

Another ( after 3: (1 + 3)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. So, a_9 is the innermost expression, and the outermost is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my calculation above, a_9 is the result of the innermost expression, but actually, each a_n is the result of each layer moving outward. So, a_1 is the innermost, a_2 is the next layer, up to a_9, which is the result of the 9th layer, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(a_9), so yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in computing each a_n. Let me go through each step again:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, perhaps the general term can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me see if a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Since the expression starts with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), and each layer adds another 3*(...), how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, each time we move outward, we have another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3: layer 1.\n\n- Then, moving outward: 1 + 3*(1 + 3): layer 2.\n\n- Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)): layer 3.\n\n- Continuing this way, until we reach the outermost layer, which is layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, so n=9 in the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but nested.\n\nWait, but in this case, since it's finite, with 9 layers, it's better to compute it step by step or use the formula.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Define Each Layer:**\n   Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Expression:**\n   The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this expression step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So that part is easy. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each level is 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. So maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each layer one by one. Let me write this down to keep track.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So actually, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), and that happens 8 times inside the initial 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, each time another (1 + 3*(...)) is added. Let me count how many times the 3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, then inside that, we have 1+3(...), and each time another 1+3(...) is added. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Let's see: the first is 1+3(...), then another, up to 9 times? Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses. After the first 3, we have 1 + 3(...), then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's count the number of layers. Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). How many layers are there? Let's see: the expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count how many layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3 * 24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again, because that seems too big, and maybe I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but I feel like that's a very large number, so maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nWait, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 8 layers inside the first 3. Wait, no, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside the first 3, so total 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Wait, no, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, each time another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but maybe I should check my calculations step by step again because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nLet me recompute each layer carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nHmm, so the total is 88,572. That seems correct based on the step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nWait, the expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see: the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), so the innermost is layer 1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute a_9:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. So, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding the innermost layers to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nSimilarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait a minute, so each layer seems to be the sum of 3^k from k=0 to n, where n is the layer number. Wait, but let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, but 81 + 27 is 108, plus 9 is 117, plus 3 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n: a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that's the formula for the sum of a geometric series: sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and identify each layer.\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost out.\n3. Alternatively, use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find each layer's value.\n4. Multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the 9th layer, this gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the left, I see 3 times (1 + 3 times something), and that something has another 3 times (1 + 3 times something else), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, let's count: 1. 3(1+3(2. 1+3(3. 1+3(4. 1+3(5. 1+3(6. 1+3(7. 1+3(8. 1+3(9. 1+3)))))))))) Hmm, okay, so I think there are nine layers here, starting from the outermost 3 and going in. So maybe I can start solving from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually works with nested parentheses. So, the innermost part is 1+3. Let's compute that first. So, innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result of the innermost expression). So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(40). Let's calculate that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that layer is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240, so 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again more carefully. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Next layer: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Next: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Next: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Next: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Next: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Next: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Finally, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make it easier to compute without having to do each step manually. Let me see: Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each step as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on. Wait, actually, no, because a_1 would be the innermost, which is 4, then a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, etc., up to a_9, which would be the result before the outermost 3 is multiplied. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let me think: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant. Let's find C. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + C => 3A + C=4. Now, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 3A - 1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each step is of the form (3^{n} -1)/2, so after 9 steps, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, so 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that makes sense. So, the key was to recognize the pattern and find a formula for the nth term, which avoids having to compute each step individually, especially since there are nine layers here. Alternatively, I could have just computed each step step-by-step, as I did earlier, and arrived at the same answer. Either way, it seems consistent, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Hmm, okay, so that part simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So now, this part simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next level out would be 1 + 3*40. Let me do that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So that's 121.\n\nGoing another level out, we have 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, that part is 364.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So that's 1093.\n\nNow, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Well, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 is 9841. That's 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's 29524.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 1 + 88572 is 88573. That's 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check that last multiplication because it's a big number and it's easy to make a mistake. So, 88573 times 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 70 = 210\n- 3 * 500 = 1500\n- 3 * 8000 = 24000\n- 3 * 80000 = 240000\n\nAdding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It's almost like a geometric series, but with each term being built upon the previous one. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to something like a geometric progression where each term is defined recursively.\n\nWait, actually, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using that approach. Let me see, if I have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1 (since the innermost term is (1+3) = 4, but maybe that's a_1? Let me check.\n\nWait, the innermost term is (1+3) = 4, which would be a_1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for a linear recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first, and each subsequent layer adds another, so the outermost would be the 9th layer. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Wait, that's the same as the result I got earlier when I was working from the inside out. So, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 265719 as the final result. But according to this formula, it's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step computation where I ended up with 265719. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check my step-by-step computation again. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so actually, the outermost operation is 3 times the 9th layer, which is 29524, giving 88572. But earlier, I thought that the final result was 265719. So, that was incorrect. It seems that I must have miscounted the number of layers or miscalculated somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer, and each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is one layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...)))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, the expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), so the innermost is the first layer, and the outermost is the ninth. So, when I computed up to a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3, that's correct, giving 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I was working through the layers, I thought that the outermost operation was 3*(...), so that would be 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and my final answer should be 88572, not 265719. So, I must have made a mistake in my earlier multiplication.\n\nWait, let me check the last step again. So, after computing a_9 = 29524, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 2 (from 29524), so 2*3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that the final result was 265719, which was incorrect. So, I must have miscounted the layers or miscalculated the number of multiplications.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check that again. The formula I derived was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to a_9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the answer was 265719 was wrong; it's actually 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 9 layers, but when I was multiplying, I ended up with 265719, which is 3^12 or something? Wait, 3^12 is 531441, so that's not it. Wait, 3^10 is 59049, 3^11 is 177147, 3^12 is 531441. So, 265719 is between 3^11 and 3^12. But according to the formula, the result should be 88572, which is 3*29524.\n\nI think I must have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3\n2. (1+3\n3. (1+3\n4. (1+3\n5. (1+3\n6. (1+3\n7. (1+3\n8. (1+3\n9. (1+3\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning there are 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 265719, which is 3*88573. But 88573 is a_10, not a_9. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4 (a_1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (a_2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (a_3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (a_4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (a_5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (a_6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (a_7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (a_8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (a_9)\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was correct, and my confusion came from miscounting the layers when I thought I was getting 265719, which was actually a miscalculation on my part.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with the formula again. The formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers or miscalculating the final multiplication. The correct answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers.\n\nEach layer adds another 3^k term. So, expanding it out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which would be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9). Wait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, each time you have 1 + 3*something, which can be thought of as adding 1 and then scaling the rest by 3. So, if you expand it all the way, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) which would indeed be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9). So, that's a geometric series with ratio 3 and 10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9). The sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, sum = (3^10 -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I was confused earlier because I was trying to compute each layer step by step and might have lost track, but using the formula confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing it as a geometric series. Each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be solved using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. After simplifying, the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nLet me rewrite the problem to make it a bit clearer. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...) term. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of innermost)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of previous)\n...\nAnd this goes on until the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, I think the way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards, computing each layer step by step. That way, each time I compute a layer, I can substitute its value into the next outer layer.\n\nLet me try to do that. Let's start with the innermost expression:\n\nFirst layer (innermost):\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving out one layer, we have:\n\nSecond layer:\n1 + 3*(result from first layer) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the second layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer:\n\nThird layer:\n1 + 3*(result from second layer) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, third layer is 40. Next layer:\n\nFourth layer:\n1 + 3*(result from third layer) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nFourth layer is 121. Continuing outward:\n\nFifth layer:\n1 + 3*(result from fourth layer) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nFifth layer is 364. Next:\n\nSixth layer:\n1 + 3*(result from fifth layer) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSixth layer is 1093. Moving out another layer:\n\nSeventh layer:\n1 + 3*(result from sixth layer) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nSeventh layer is 3280. Next layer:\n\nEighth layer:\n1 + 3*(result from seventh layer) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nEighth layer is 9841. Now, moving out another layer:\n\nNinth layer:\n1 + 3*(result from eighth layer) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNinth layer is 29524. Finally, the outermost layer:\n\nTenth layer (outermost):\n3*(result from ninth layer) = 3*29524\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost up to the ninth layer, which gives us 29524, we then have to compute 1 + 3*(29524), and then multiply that by 3? Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nEach time, there's a 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...)\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" is another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a \"1 + 3(\", so the number of such layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we have a 1+3(...\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...).\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(...), the innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nLet me see: Each time we have a \"1 + 3(\", so how many times does this occur?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3*(1 + 3, we have 8 more \"1 + 3(\" before the last closing parenthesis. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + 3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\n- The first layer is 1 + 3\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nSo, each time, we add another layer.\n\nLooking at the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each time we have another \"1 + 3(\", which is a new layer.\n\nSo, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nBut in the original expression, how many such layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1 + 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3*(1 + 3, we have 8 more opening parentheses: each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression:\n\n- The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each time we have a \"1 + 3(\" which is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1 + 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1 + 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\nAfter 3*(1 + 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses here is 8, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we have another \"1 + 3(\", so how many times does that happen?\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nIn the original expression, after the initial 3*(1 + 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1 + 3 is 8. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. So, with 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3*(1 + 3, that would mean 8 more layers, making a total of 9 layers? Wait, no, because the initial 3*(1 + 3 is already layer 1, then each opening parenthesis adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, how many \"1 + 3(\" are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each time we have a \"1 + 3(\", which is another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nEach time, we have another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial one is 8, because the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 1 + 3, we have 8 more \"1 + 3(\" instances. Therefore, the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, no, because the initial 3*(1 + 3 is layer 1, then each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, if there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" after the initial, that would make 9 layers in total.\n\nBut when I was computing earlier, I only went up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524, and then I thought I needed to compute one more layer, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me try to visualize the expression as layers:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, in total, we have 9 layers, with Layer 1 being the innermost, and Layer 9 being the result of the innermost computations, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 9.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier computation was correct, where I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then I thought I needed to compute another layer, but perhaps that's not necessary because the outermost operation is just 3*(Layer 9). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nSo, that would be the final step. So, I think I had it right earlier when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I stopped at Layer 9 as 29524, thinking that was the final result, but actually, the problem is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, so after computing the innermost up to Layer 9 as 29524, we then have 3*(29524).\n\nSo, let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n_________\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n  29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n  88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9 as 29,524. Let me go back through the layers to check for any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out correctly. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer of 1 + 3. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and after computing all nine layers, the result is 29,524. Then, the outermost operation is multiplying this result by 3, which gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one level out, we have 3 times that result plus 1. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list out each layer from the innermost to the outermost to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer out: 3*(result from step 1) + 1\n3. Then, the next layer: 3*(result from step 2) + 1\n4. Continue this process until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, maybe it's better to compute starting from the innermost and working our way out. Let's assign each layer a number to keep track.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are 9 layers of nesting.\n\nStarting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, the outermost layer is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, we multiply it by 3.\n\nLet me confirm that. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, yes, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the innermost expression.\n\nSo, if L9 is 29524, then the total value is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the previous steps because this seems like a large number, and I might have made a mistake in computing L9.\n\nLet me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with L1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12 \u2192 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9 \u2192 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240 \u2192 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the first 3: each \"1+\" is followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each step out adds a layer. Let's count the number of closing parentheses at the end: there are 9 closing parentheses after the innermost. So, that would mean 9 layers? Wait, no, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we nest the expressions.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have 1+3(...), that's one layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then the next layer is 1+3*(layer1), which is layer2, and so on until the outermost layer, which is 3*(layer9). So, yes, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation of L1 to L9 is correct, with L9 being 29524, and the final result being 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say if the expression was only one layer: 3(1+3). Then, compute that: 3*(1+3)=3*4=12.\n\nIf it's two layers: 3(1+3(1+3))=3*(1+3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39.\n\nThree layers: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))=3*(1+3*(1+3*4))=3*(1+3*13)=3*(1+39)=3*40=120.\n\nWait, so let's see if that matches with the pattern I used earlier.\n\nFor n layers, the value seems to be 3*(something). Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nWait, for n=1: 3*(1+3)=12.\n\nn=2: 3*(1+3*(1+3))=39.\n\nn=3: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))=120.\n\nWait, let me compute n=4: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))=3*(1+3*(1+3*13))=3*(1+3*40)=3*(1+120)=3*121=363.\n\nWait, so n=1:12, n=2:39, n=3:120, n=4:363, n=5:1092, n=6:3285, n=7:9852, n=8:29553, n=9:88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, for n=9, I got 88572, which matches the outermost 3*(L9). So, yes, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since the outermost operation is 3*a_9, and a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost one.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find the outermost layer by multiplying the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to parse this step by step. Let me write it out more clearly, maybe starting from the innermost part and working my way out. The innermost part is 1+3, right? So that's the first one. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that level gives me 13. Now, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So that would be 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, so now I'm at 40. Next level out, it's 1 + 3 times 40. So 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Wait, that seems familiar, 121 is 11 squared. Interesting. Let me check if that pattern continues. Next level: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, 364 isn't a perfect square, but maybe it's just a coincidence. Let me continue. Next level: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, not sure if that's significant. Next level: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then plus 1 is 3280. Okay, so that's 3280. Next level out: 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then plus 1 is 9841. Hmm, 9841. Wait, is that a perfect square? Let me check. 99 squared is 9801, 100 squared is 10000, so 99.5 squared is approximately 9900.25, which is not 9841. Wait, maybe it's 99 squared plus something. 99 squared is 9801, so 9841 - 9801 is 40. So it's 99 squared plus 40, which isn't a perfect square. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation? Let me double-check 3*3280. 3280 times 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 9840 + 1 is 9841. So that's correct. Okay, moving on. Next level: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524. Hmm, 29524. Is that a square? Let me see. 170 squared is 28900, 180 squared is 32400. So maybe 172 squared? Let's check: 170 squared is 28900, plus 2*170 + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344, so 28900 + 344 = 29244. That's less than 29524. 173 squared: 170 squared is 28900, plus 3*170*2 = 1020, plus 9 = 1029, so 28900 + 1029 = 29929, which is higher than 29524. So no, not a perfect square. Maybe I made a mistake? Wait, 3*9841: Let me compute 9841*3 again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 is 29520, +3 is 29523. So 29523 +1 is 29524. Correct. Okay, moving on. Next level: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 is 88500, +72 is 88572. Then plus 1 is 88573. Hmm, that's a big number. Not sure if it's significant, but okay. Next level out: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 73*3=219. Adding these up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500 is 265500, +219 is 265719. Then plus 1 is 265720. Okay, so that's 265720. Next level: 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 720*3=2160. So adding up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, +15000 is 795000, +2160 is 797160. Then plus 1 is 797161. Hmm, 797161. Is that a square? Let me check. 893 squared is 797449, which is higher. 890 squared is 792100. So 890 squared is 792100, 891 squared is 792100 + 2*890 +1 = 792100 + 1780 +1=793881. 892 squared is 793881 + 2*891 +1=793881 + 1782 +1=795664. 893 squared is 795664 + 2*892 +1=795664 + 1784 +1=797449. So 797161 is between 892 squared and 893 squared. So it's not a perfect square. Hmm, okay, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just continue. Next level: 1 + 3*797161. Let's compute 3*797161. 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 161*3=483. Adding up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, +21000 is 2391000, +483 is 2391483. Then plus 1 is 2391484. Next level out: 1 + 3*2391484. Let me compute 3*2391484. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1484*3=4452. Adding up: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, +270000 is 7170000, +4452 is 7174452. Then plus 1 is 7174453. Hmm, okay, that's a huge number. Let me check if I did that correctly. 2391484 times 3: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000; 300,000*3=900,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 1,484*3=4,452. So adding them: 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000; +270,000 = 7,170,000; +4,452 = 7,174,452. Then +1 is 7,174,453. Correct. Now, the outermost expression is 3 times that result. So 3*7,174,453. Let me compute that. 7,000,000*3=21,000,000; 174,453*3: let's compute 100,000*3=300,000; 70,000*3=210,000; 4,000*3=12,000; 453*3=1,359. So adding those: 300,000 + 210,000 = 510,000; +12,000 = 522,000; +1,359 = 523,359. So 7,174,453*3 = 21,000,000 + 523,359 = 21,523,359. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 21,523,359. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me recount how many levels there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So each \"1+3(...)\" is a level, and there are nine such levels, right? Let me count the opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So yes, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each subsequent level adds another 1+3(...). So that's nine levels, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I went through each level step by step, starting from the innermost and working out, and ended up with 21,523,359 as the final result. So maybe that's the correct answer. But let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each level manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. I remember that expressions like this, which have a repeated structure, can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's denote each level as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_0 = 1. Wait, but in the problem, the innermost term is 1+3, which would be a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, where a_0 is 1. So let me check: a_0 = 1. Then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. a_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. a_11 = 1 + 3*a_10 = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720. a_12 = 1 + 3*a_11 = 1 + 3*265720 = 797161. a_13 = 1 + 3*a_12 = 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484. a_14 = 1 + 3*a_13 = 1 + 3*2391484 = 7174453. a_15 = 1 + 3*a_14 = 1 + 3*7174453 = 21523359 +1? Wait, no, 3*7174453 is 21523359, so a_15 = 21523359 +1? Wait, no, the formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So a_15 would be 1 + 3*a_14 = 1 + 3*7174453 = 21523359 +1? Wait, no, 3*7174453 is 21,523,359, plus 1 is 21,523,360. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I ended up with 21,523,359. There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let me check my previous calculations. When I was computing the outermost expression, I had 3*(7,174,453) which was 21,523,359. But according to the sequence, a_15 should be 1 + 3*a_14, which is 1 + 3*7,174,453 = 1 + 21,523,359 = 21,523,360. Hmm, so which one is correct? Did I make a mistake in the earlier step? Let me check the last step again. The original problem is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3. So when I computed up to a_14 = 7,174,453, then the outermost expression is 3*a_14, which is 3*7,174,453 = 21,523,359. So that should be correct. However, in the sequence, a_15 would be 1 + 3*a_14, which would be 21,523,360, but that's one more than the result we have. So perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me recount how many levels there are in the original problem. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" terms. Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then each subsequent level adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, each corresponding to a new level. So the innermost is level 1: 1+3. Then level 2: 1+3*(level1). Up to level 9: 1+3*(level8). Then the outermost is 3*(level9). So the total number of levels is 9, meaning that a_9 would be the innermost term, and the outermost is 3*a_9. Wait, but in my sequence above, a_1 = 4, which is the first level, and a_9 would be the ninth level, which is 9841. Then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523, but that doesn't match what I had earlier. Wait, no, that can't be right because in my initial step-by-step, I had 14 levels. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the original expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first \"1+3(\", that's level 1. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2.     1+3(\n3.         1+3(\n4.             1+3(\n5.                 1+3(\n6.                     1+3(\n7.                         1+3(\n8.                             1+3(\n9.                                 1+3(\n10.                                      ... )\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3(1+3(..., there are 9 \"1+3(\" instances. So that would mean 9 levels, right? So the innermost is level 9: 1+3. Then each level outwards adds one more. So the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 levels. So according to my sequence earlier, a_9 is 9841. So 3*a_9 = 3*9841 = 29523. But that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I ended up with 21,523,359. So I must have miscounted the levels earlier. Let me clarify. If the original expression has 9 levels of \"1+3(\", then a_9 is 9841, and the final result is 3*9841 = 29523. But when I computed step by step earlier, I ended up with 21,523,359, which suggests that I went through 14 levels. So I think I must have miscounted the levels in the original problem. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" is a new level. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. There are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the first 3. So that would mean 9 levels, with the innermost being 1+3, and each level outwards adds another multiplication. So the innermost is level 1: 1+3=4. Then level 2: 1+3*4=13. Level 3:1+3*13=40. Level4:1+3*40=121. Level5:1+3*121=364. Level6:1+3*364=1093. Level7:1+3*1093=3280. Level8:1+3*3280=9841. Level9:1+3*9841=29524. Then the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572. Wait, that's different from my initial step-by-step. So perhaps I miscounted earlier. So if there are 9 levels, the result is 88572. But when I computed step by step earlier, I went through 15 levels, ending up with 21,523,359. So I must have miscounted the number of levels in the original problem. Let me try to count the number of parentheses to determine how many levels there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new level. So:\n\n- 3(1+3( ... )) : 1\n- Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds one more.\n\nSo let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2.     1+3(\n3.         1+3(\n4.             1+3(\n5.                 1+3(\n6.                     1+3(\n7.                         1+3(\n8.                             1+3(\n9.                                 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 levels of \"1+3(\", right? So the innermost is 1+3, which is level 1, and the outermost is 3*(level9). So according to this, the result should be 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I ended up with 21,523,359, which suggests I went through 15 levels. So I must have miscounted the number of levels in the original problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has more levels than I thought. Let me count the number of closing parentheses as well to see how many levels there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3))))))))))))))))) \n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo after the first 3(, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", each followed by a closing parenthesis. So the structure is:\n\n3( \n    1+3( \n        1+3( \n            ... \n            1+3 \n        ) \n    ) \n... \n) \n\nSo each \"1+3(\" adds a new level, and the total number of such is 9. Therefore, the innermost is 1+3, and each level outwards adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So the sequence would be:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I was computing step by step, I went through 15 levels, which suggests that I miscounted the number of levels in the original problem. It's possible that the original problem has 9 levels, not 15, which would make the answer 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It's written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" is a new level. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 3(\n2.     1+3(\n3.         1+3(\n4.             1+3(\n5.                 1+3(\n6.                     1+3(\n7.                         1+3(\n8.                             1+3(\n9.                                 1+3(\n\nSo that's 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Therefore, the innermost is 1+3, and each level outwards adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, for a total of 9 levels. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9, where a9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think earlier when I was computing step by step, I must have miscounted the number of levels, thinking there were more than 9, which led me to an incorrect larger number. So to avoid confusion, I should stick to the correct count of 9 levels, leading to 88,572 as the final result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C - 1/2 => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple levels of multiplication and addition. By carefully expanding each level from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me try to visualize the structure:\n\nStarting from the innermost part, it's just 1+3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, writing down the results as I go. Let me try that.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, let me count the number of 3(...). It's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. There's 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and each time, it's another 3(...). So, from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer, then each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, how many layers? Let me see: starting from the innermost, layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2: 1+3*(layer 1). Layer 3: 1+3*(layer 2). And so on, until layer 9: 1+3*(layer 8). Wait, but the problem is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))). So, maybe the number of layers is 9, as there are nine 3(...) parts? Let me check: the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's 8 layers. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 3(...) expressions. The first 3 is outside, then inside it's 1+3(...), so that's one layer. Then inside that, another 3(...), so that's two layers, and so on until the innermost part, which is 1+3. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, 1+3: that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, 1+3*(layer1): that's layer 2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(layer2): layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, each time adding a layer, until we reach the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) parts.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first term is 3, then inside it's (1 + 3*(...)), which is 9 layers deep? Hmm, maybe. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Each time there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 inside adds another layer. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 3( in the expression. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1+3(, so that's another 3(, and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many 3( are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. But the innermost part is 1+3, which doesn't have a 3( after it. So, perhaps there are 8 layers? Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because the innermost is 1+3, so the layers would be 8, each adding another 3*(...). Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 9 layers because each time you have a 3*(1+3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, 1+3 is layer 1, then each time you go out, you add another layer. So, if there are 8 sets of 3*(...), then there are 8 layers. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to just start computing from the innermost layer and work my way out step by step, regardless of how many layers there are. Let's try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. Let me write that down as layer1.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(layer1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, layer2 is 13.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(layer2). So, that's 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, layer3 is 40.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer4 is 121.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer5 is 364.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer6 is 1093.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer7 is 3280.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer8 is 9841.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNow, moving outward another layer: 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer9 is 29524.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if I've correctly counted the layers. Because I started from the innermost as layer1, and I've gone up to layer9. But the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing layer9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire inner expression. So, when I computed up to layer9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). Therefore, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me verify. Because in my earlier steps, I went from layer1 to layer9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). But in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I went one layer too far. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should have only 8 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each time moving outward, we have another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3( inside.\n\nFrom the innermost: 1+3, that's layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time another 1+3*(...). So, let's count the number of 3( after each 1+.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3( is at the very beginning, then inside it's 1+3(, then inside that is 1+3(, and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many times does 3( appear? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, that would mean 9 layers, right? So, layer1 is 1+3, layer2 is 1+3*(layer1), up to layer9, which is 1+3*(layer8). Then, the outermost operation is 3*(layer9). So, perhaps I was correct in computing up to layer9, and then the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I computed layer9 as 29524, which would be the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. But wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, in my earlier steps, I computed layer1 as 4, layer2 as 13, layer3 as 40, layer4 as 121, layer5 as 364, layer6 as 1093, layer7 as 3280, layer8 as 9841, and layer9 as 29524. So, then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because when I started, I thought maybe I was overcomplicating it, but perhaps that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually computing each layer, especially if there are many layers.\n\nWait, but in this case, there are only 9 layers, so it's manageable. But perhaps I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1+3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can compute a_9, then multiply by 3, I'll have the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern. Let me compute the first few a_n:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, a9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that computation again because 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + 0 = 27, but wait, let me do it properly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers.\n\na1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\na2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\na3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\na4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nWait, let me write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let me check n=9.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, correct.\n\n59049 -1 is 59048.\n\n59048 divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression in terms of 3^10.\n\nWait, let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. Using the formula, the innermost value is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

    "text": " Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the expression is 1+3. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Then, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write this down as I go along to keep track.\n\nFirst, let's define each level to make it clearer. Let's number the innermost expression as Level 1, then each subsequent layer as Level 2, Level 3, and so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1). Level 3 would be 1 + 3*(Level 2), and so on until Level 9.\n\nLet me try to compute each level one by one.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Level 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 + 1 = 364. Level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, which is 29524. So, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again because 3*29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems very large. Let me verify the earlier steps because the problem is a nested expression with nine levels, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the levels.\n\nLet me go back and check each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 \u00d7 3. 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 \u00d7 3: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 \u00d73: 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840. So, 9000 +840=9840. Then, 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 +3*9841. 9841 \u00d73: Let's compute 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. Adding up: 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Level 9 is indeed 29524, and 3\u00d729524 is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here instead of computing each level step by step. Since each level is defined by Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1), this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Level n.\n\nLet me think about this recurrence relation. The general form is Level n = 1 + 3*(Level n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a formula for Level n in terms of n.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nLevel n = 3 * Level (n-1) + 1, with Level 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is Level n = 3 * Level (n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is Level_h(n) = C * 3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say Level_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Level(n) = Level_h(n) + Level_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, Level(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Level(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Level(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Level(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, Level(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * Level(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because 3*29524 is 88572. Let me compute it another way.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another approach. Since Level(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(Level(9)) = 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^11 = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Since each level is built upon the previous one, and each time we multiply by 3 and add 1, the structure is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But I think the approach I took earlier using the recurrence relation is sufficient.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each level step by step and then using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result both ways, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each level from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, the innermost part is layer 1, then layer 2 wraps around that, and so on, up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, if we have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the layers again, maybe using a different approach or checking if I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table of each layer's value:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nYes, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each step, multiply by 3 and add 1. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, etc. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost expressions and work our way outwards.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let's see: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on, until we have nine layers in total. So, I think I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. That way, each time I can substitute the inner expression with its computed value and then move to the next layer.\n\nLet me try to write down each step as I go. Let me start by labeling each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. But actually, since the innermost is the first one, maybe it's better to start with the innermost and work my way outwards, computing each expression as I go.\n\nSo, let's start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving out to Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so that's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so that's 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 300 + 60 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me break it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times this Layer 9 expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n29524 \u00d7 3: \n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the multiplication earlier, I got 88572, but when I broke it down digit by digit, I think I might have made a mistake because when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think it's actually 88572. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 +2=17 \u2192 7, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the digits are 7,7,5,8,7,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d73 is 88572. Let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2,7,5,8,7,7. Wait, that would make it 775872? No, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d73 is 88572. Wait, I think I messed up the place values.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. When multiplied by 3, each digit is multiplied from right to left.\n\nSo:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\nSo, the result is 88572. So, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 of them before the last closing parenthesis. So, I think I did compute all 9 layers correctly, ending up with 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nBut let me try another approach just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, as we computed. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which also matches. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works. Therefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we computed earlier.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1 is indeed a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. We found C = -1/2, and then using the initial condition a_1=4, we found A=3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. That seems correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 =88572.\n\nWait, but 3^{10} is 59049? Let me confirm that. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscalculate 3*29524. Let me do it again:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\nSo, from right to left, the digits are 2,7,5,8,7,7? Wait, that would be 775872, which can't be right because 29524 \u00d73 is 88572. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens place is 7\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands place is 8\nSo, the result is 88572, which is a 5-digit number: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, I think I confused myself earlier when I was writing out the digits, but now I see that it's correct. So, the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also gave me the same result. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give me the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost layer and working our way outwards. The given expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 \\) is the innermost layer.

Let me compute that. 1 + 3*4 is 1 + 12, which is 13. So, now, the next layer out is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, okay, so now that part becomes 40. The next layer out is (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that part becomes 121. Next, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*121). Let me calculate that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that becomes 364. Next, the next layer is (1 + 3*364). Let me compute that. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, that part is 1093. Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*1093). Let me calculate that. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, that becomes 3280. Next, the next layer is (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute that. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, that part is 9841. Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*9841). Let me calculate that. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, that becomes 29524. Next, the next layer is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. So, that part is 88573. Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*88573). Let me calculate that. 3*88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. So, that becomes 265720. Finally, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*265720). Let me compute that. 3*265720 is 797160, plus 1 is 797161. So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 797161. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3 * 797161. Let me compute that. 3 * 700000 is 2,100,000. 3 * 97,161 is let's see, 3*90,000 is 270,000, 3*7,161 is 21,483. So, 270,000 + 21,483 is 291,483. Then, adding that to 2,100,000 gives me 2,391,483. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each step to make sure I didn't miscalculate any of the inner expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, moving out, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Next, 1+3*40=121. Then, 1+3*121=364. Next, 1+3*364=1093. Then, 1+3*1093=3280. Next, 1+3*3280=9841. Then, 1+3*9841=29524. Next, 1+3*29524=88573. Then, 1+3*88573=265720. Next, 1+3*265720=797161. Finally, 3*797161=2,391,483. Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe I can approach this differently. I remember that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1, then a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, since there are 9 layers of nesting. So, if I compute each a_i step by step, I can get the final value. Let me try that approach. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, but that doesn't match what I had earlier. Earlier, I had a9 as 29524, but in my initial step-by-step, I went further out. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), right? Because each time, it's 1+3(...), and that repeats 9 times. So, perhaps I went too far earlier. Let me recount. Let me start from the innermost and work outwards, computing each a_i step by step, making sure I count correctly. Let me write down each step:\n\n1. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, a9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Wait, that's different from my earlier result of 2,391,483. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers earlier. It seems that the expression only has 9 layers, so a9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a9 = 88,572. So, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1+3(...), and each of those has another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's the first layer. Then, moving out, each (1+3(...)) adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each time, it's 1+3(...), and each of those has another layer. Let me count how many times (1+3 appears, each time followed by another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, it's (1+3(...))\n- So, each time, it's another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? So, the innermost is the first layer, and each time we move out, it's another layer, up to 9 layers. So, a9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*a9 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing up to a9 as 29524, that's correct, and then 3*29524 is 88,572. So, that seems to be the correct answer. So, I think my initial mistake was that I continued beyond 9 layers, thinking there were more, but actually, there are only 9 layers. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me count the number of (1+3(...) in the original expression. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, a9 is 29524, and 3*a9 is 88,572. So, that's the correct answer. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by computing each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\n1. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as follows:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, we can compute a_2 through a_9 as above.\n\nAlternatively, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve it by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also used the recurrence relation method to confirm. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).
