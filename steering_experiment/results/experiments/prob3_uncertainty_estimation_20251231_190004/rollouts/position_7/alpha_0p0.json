    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with a 1 and adds 3 multiplied by another set. Let me try to count them. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost one.\n\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted. Let me check again. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, so that means nine levels deep. Hmm, that's quite a few. Maybe I can work from the inside out, computing each level step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing out each level separately. Let me assign each level a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n...\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, if I compute Level 1 through Level 9, each time substituting the previous level's result, I can find the value of the entire expression.\n\nLet me start computing each level one by one.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot that. Level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, Level 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, let me check that calculation for Level 9 again. 3 times 9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n- 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29\nSo, 9841*3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Level 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, that's 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2? Wait, no, that's the next digit, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, actually, let me write it properly.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\n- Digit 1: 4 (units place)\n- Digit 2: 2 (tens place)\n- Digit 3: 5 (hundreds place)\n- Digit 4: 9 (thousands place)\n- Digit 5: 2 (ten thousands place)\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6+1=7, write 7\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6+2=8, write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n(4*3)=12, write 2, carryover 1\n(2*3)=6 +1=7, write 7\n(5*3)=15, write 5, carryover 1\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n(2*3)=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the levels correctly, because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me list all the levels again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each level is computed correctly, and each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous level). So, yes, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to go through each level manually. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(r-1)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me confirm that.\n\nFor a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nWait, let me check that formula.\n\nYes, for a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation where each term is r times the previous term plus a constant c, the solution is:\n\na_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nIn our case, a_1 = 4, but let's see if we can adjust the indices to fit this formula.\n\nWait, in the problem, Level 1 is a_1 = 4, Level 2 is a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nBut the formula I have is for a_0, a_1, etc. Let me adjust for that.\n\nIf we let n start at 0, then a_0 would be the innermost term, which is 4. But in our problem, a_1 is 4, so perhaps we need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the first term is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in this case, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1), where a_0 is the initial term when n=0.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, so when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nIf we consider the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the solution is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1).\n\nBut we need to find a_0 such that when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, substituting n=1:\n\na_1 = 3^{1} * a_0 + (3^{1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 2/2 = 3*a_0 + 1\n\nWe know that a_1 = 4, so:\n\n3*a_0 + 1 = 4 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each level.\n\nTherefore, for Level 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a formula for a_n, maybe we can express the entire expression in terms of a formula as well.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*a_9, and since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147.\n\nThus, the entire expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested term from the innermost parentheses outward. Each term follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). This pattern leads to a geometric progression, and the final value after expanding all levels is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each level from the innermost outward:\n   - Level 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Level 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Level 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Level 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Level 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Level 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Level 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Level 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Level 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal answer: \\( \\boxed{88572} \\)"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me try to write down each step carefully. \n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, that would be:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, so that simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that's:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Got it, that's 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the last result. So:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Alright, 121 so far.\n\nNext, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, 364.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Hmm, that's a big number.\n\nContinuing, the next one is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Wow, that's growing quickly.\n\nAnother layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Calculating 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me do that step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 29523 +1 = 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 88572 +1 = 88573.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 is a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 88572 +1 = 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000+24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. So, 265719 +1 = 265720.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication. 88573*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, carryover 2\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, carryover 1\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, carryover 2\n\n3*8=24 +2=26\n\nSo, writing it down: 265719. Then adding 1 gives 265720. Correct.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding these: 600000+180000=780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. So, 797160 +1 = 797161.\n\nWait, let me confirm that multiplication. 265720*3:\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000\n\n5000*3=15000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n20*3=60\n\nAdding up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 +15000=795000\n\n795000 +2100=797100\n\n797100 +60=797160\n\nYes, correct. So, 797160 +1=797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(797161). Let's compute 3*797161. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down:\n\n700000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000\n\n100*3=300\n\n60*3=180\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 +21,000=2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 +300=2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 +180=2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 +3=2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161=2,391,483. Then, adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 797,161 *3:\n\n797,161 *3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n6*3=18, carryover 1\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n7*3=21, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, carryover 2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23, carryover 2\n\n7*3=21 +2=23\n\nSo, writing it down: 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(2,391,484). Let's compute 3*2,391,484.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n2,000,000*3=6,000,000\n\n300,000*3=900,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n1,000*3=3,000\n\n400*3=1,200\n\n80*3=240\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 6,000,000 +900,000=6,900,000\n\n6,900,000 +270,000=7,170,000\n\n7,170,000 +3,000=7,173,000\n\n7,173,000 +1,200=7,174,200\n\n7,174,200 +240=7,174,440\n\n7,174,440 +12=7,174,452\n\nSo, 3*2,391,484=7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 2,391,484 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carryover 1\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, putting it together: 7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(7,174,453). Let's compute 3*7,174,453.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n7,000,000*3=21,000,000\n\n174,000*3=522,000\n\n453*3=1,359\n\nAdding them up: 21,000,000 +522,000=21,522,000\n\n21,522,000 +1,359=21,523,359\n\nSo, 3*7,174,453=21,523,359. Then, adding 1 gives 21,523,360.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication another way. 7,174,453 *3:\n\n3*3=9\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n\n4*3=12 +1=13, carryover 1\n\n7*3=21 +1=22, carryover 2\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, carryover 1\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n7*3=21\n\nSo, writing it down: 21,523,359. Adding 1 gives 21,523,360.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, the outermost operation is 3*(21,523,360).\n\nLet me compute that: 21,523,360 *3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20,000,000*3=60,000,000\n\n1,523,360*3=4,570,080\n\nAdding them up: 60,000,000 +4,570,080=64,570,080.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n21,523,360 *3:\n\n0*3=0\n\n6*3=18, write down 8, carryover 1\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carryover 1\n\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n1*3=3 +1=4\n\n2*3=6\n\nSo, writing it down: 64,570,080. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 64,570,080.\n\nWait, hold on, let me recap to make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, I worked my way out, computing each layer step by step, and ended up with 64,570,080. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recount the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n\n2. 1+3*4=13\n\n3. 1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\n10. 1+3*29524=88573\n\n11. 1+3*88573=265720\n\n12. 1+3*265720=797161\n\n13. 1+3*797161=2391484\n\n14. 1+3*2391484=7174453\n\n15. 1+3*7174453=21523360\n\n16. 3*21523360=64570080\n\nWait, so actually, I have 16 layers? No, let me count the number of times I performed the operation 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost, each time I moved out a layer, I did that operation. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*... So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each subsequent \"(\" adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. After first 3: (1+3(\n2. Then another ( inside: (1+3(\n3. Continuing: (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3))\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, I should have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) =4\n\n2. Next: 1 +3*4=13\n\n3. Next:1 +3*13=40\n\n4. Next:1 +3*40=121\n\n5. Next:1 +3*121=364\n\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1093\n\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that's conflicting with my earlier count. Earlier, I went out to 16 layers, but actually, the expression has only 9 layers of nesting. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by going too far.\n\nWait, let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3))\n\nSo, 9 layers. Therefore, starting from the innermost, I should compute 9 layers, each time 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nWait, so perhaps my earlier calculation was incorrect because I continued beyond 9 layers. Let me redo this correctly.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) =4\n\n2. Next layer:1 +3*4=13\n\n3. Next:1 +3*13=40\n\n4. Next:1 +3*40=121\n\n5. Next:1 +3*121=364\n\n6. Next:1 +3*364=1093\n\n7. Next:1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8. Next:1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9. Next:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 *3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, perhaps I confused the number of layers earlier. So, according to this, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...). If there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost, each time I compute 1 + 3*(previous result), that's 9 times, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner 9-layer expression.\n\nSo, let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nSo, that's the correct answer. Earlier, I continued beyond 9 layers, which was incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers of nesting. Therefore, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond 9 layers, which led me to 64,570,080, which is way too big. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier. Let me confirm by looking at the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"(\" adds a layer. Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3))\n\nSo, 9 layers. Therefore, after computing 9 layers, the result is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 16 layers, which was wrong. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check this by another method. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This kind of recursive structure might have a formula. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\na_2 =1 +3*a1=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a3=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a4=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a5=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, as above, a_9=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I miscounted the layers, I got a different result. So, I need to make sure that I'm correctly applying the formula.\n\nGiven that the expression has 9 layers, a_9=29524, then 3*a9=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I just need to make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors in my initial step-by-step. Let me quickly verify a few key steps.\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. It was a bit confusing at first because of the many layers, but by breaking it down step by step and verifying with a formula, I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each term follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the result efficiently. The final computation yields the answer:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, so let me write this down to visualize it better. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parentheses. Inside that parentheses, it's 1 plus 3 times another parentheses, which itself contains 1 plus 3 times another parentheses, and so on. Counting the number of parentheses might help. Let me see: starting from the outermost, it's 3(1+3(...)), and each time, there's another 1+3(...) until the innermost part, which is just 1+3. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, that's not right. Each time I have a 3(1+3(...)), so each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me try to count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next layer: 1+3(innermost)\n3. Then: 1+3(next layer)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1+3(...), starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of 1+3 parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, maybe I can compute this starting from the innermost and work my way outwards. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me define each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, until L9, which is the outermost layer. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(L9), but actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if L9 is the innermost 1+3, then each layer is built upon the previous. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my notation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's try that.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost parentheses first. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's denote this as A1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(A1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this A2 = 13.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(A2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, A3 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(A3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. A4 = 121.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(A4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. A5 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(A5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. A6 = 1093.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*(A6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. A7 = 3280.\n\nContinuing, 1 + 3*(A7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. A8 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(A8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, A9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(A9). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3. Again, breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524*3. Alternatively, 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step builds upon the previous, and the calculations seem accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, starting from A1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for A_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, with A1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is A_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find D first. If we assume A_n approaches a steady state as n increases, then in the limit, A_n = A_{n-1} = A. So, A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Hmm, but that's negative, which doesn't make sense in our context because all A_n are positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is A_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try that.\n\nAssume the particular solution is a constant D. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is A_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition A1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1, A1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is A_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: A1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: A2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct.\n\nSo, the formula A_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works. Therefore, since we have 9 layers, A9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, A9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a geometric series. Since each A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, and A_{n-1} = 1 + 3*A_{n-2}, and so on, this can be expanded as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nIndeed, expanding A_n, we get:\n\nA_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but in our case, A1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^1 + 3^0.\n\nA2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, A3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, A_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nIn our case, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/(3-1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula we found earlier.\n\nSo, since we have A9, which is the sum up to 3^9, but wait, no, because n=9 would mean sum up to 3^9, but in our case, A9 is the 9th layer, which is sum up to 3^8? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, when n=1, A1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = sum up to 3^1.\n\nn=2, A2=13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = sum up to 3^2.\n\nSo, in general, A_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for A9, it's sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the geometric series approach also confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, using either iterative computation or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so starting from the inside would be the logical approach.\n\nAlright, let me write this down more clearly to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. That should be straightforward.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me compute that step by step.\n\nSecond innermost: 1 + 3*(result from above). So, substituting the innermost result, it's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, adding 1 gives me 13. So, the second innermost expression is 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that. 3*13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40. So, that level simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next level out is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we have 121.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364 is the result here.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364 first. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093.\n\nNext, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841.\n\nNext, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because that seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute 88573 * 3 step by step:\n\n88573\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1 and carry over 2\n3*5 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1\n3*8 = 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, write down 5 and carry over 2\n3*8 = 24, plus the carried 2 is 26.\n\nSo, writing it all together, it's 265719. Wait, that's the same as before. So, no, I didn't make a mistake there. So, the final result is 265719.\n\nBut let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors because that's a lot of steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 3*88573 = 265719\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation, especially since this expression is a repeated structure. It might be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me define the terms more formally. Let\u2019s denote the innermost term as a base case and build up from there.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen,\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na\u2081\u2080 = 1 + 3*a\u2089 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080 = 3*88573 = 265719\n\nSo, by defining each term step by step, I arrive at the same result. This method seems systematic and reduces the chance of error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric sequence. Each term a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a\u2099.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, when n=1, a\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a\u2081\u2080 as the innermost term, but actually, let's see how many terms we have.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3 terms, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new term. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a term. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, we have one more layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, meaning there are 8 layers inside. So, starting from the innermost, we have 8 terms, so a\u2081 to a\u2088.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had a\u2081 to a\u2081\u2080. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" corresponds to a new term. Let me write the structure:\n\nLevel 1: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nLevel 2: 3(1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach time, the depth increases by 1. So, the innermost is at level 9, because starting from the outermost, each \"1 + 3(\" increases the level by 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times the operation is nested.\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2013 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) \u2013 layer 2\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2013 layer 3\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) \u2013 layer 4\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) \u2013 layer 5\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) \u2013 layer 6\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) \u2013 layer 7\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) \u2013 layer 8\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2013 layer 9\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3 times the layer 9 expression. So, the total number of layers inside the outermost 3 is 9. Therefore, the innermost is layer 9, and each layer outside is one less.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step, I had a\u2081 to a\u2081\u2080, which seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial step-by-step was misaligned with the layers. Let me try to reconcile this.\n\nIf the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = ?\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a\u2081\u2080, which might have been incorrect. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nHow many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 8. So, the innermost is layer 8.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the confusion. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, actually, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 8, which means there are 8 layers inside. So, the innermost is layer 8.\n\nTherefore, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a\u2081\u2080, which was incorrect. It should be up to a\u2088.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. a\u2081 = 4\n\n2. a\u2082 =13\n\n3. a\u2083=40\n\n4. a\u2084=121\n\n5. a\u2085=364\n\n6. a\u2086=1093\n\n7. a\u2087=3280\n\n8. a\u2088=9841\n\n9. a\u2089=29524\n\n10. a\u2081\u2080=88573\n\nBut if the innermost is layer 8, then the outermost expression is 3*a\u2088.\n\nWait, that conflicts with my initial calculation. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial step-by-step was correct because each layer adds a new a\u2099, starting from a\u2081 as the innermost. So, if the innermost is a\u2081, then each subsequent layer is a\u2082, a\u2083, etc., up to a\u2089, which would be the term just inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a\u2081 =4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nSo, a\u2081 =4\n\na\u2082=1 +3*4=13\n\na\u2083=1 +3*13=40\n\na\u2084=1 +3*40=121\n\na\u2085=1 +3*121=364\n\na\u2086=1 +3*364=1093\n\na\u2087=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na\u2088=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na\u2089=1 +3*9841=29524\n\na\u2081\u2080=1 +3*29524=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080=3*88573=265719.\n\nBut according to the structure, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost (1 +3) as layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3(...), up to layer 9, which is just inside the outermost 3. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089=3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, no, hold on. If a\u2081 is the innermost, then a\u2082 is one layer out, and so on, up to a\u2089 being the term just inside the outermost 3. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed a\u2081\u2080 as 88573, which would be the term just inside the outermost 3, making the outermost expression 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nBut how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, the number of opening parentheses increases by 1.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nHow many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, after the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ... (1 + 3(...\n3. ... (1 + 3(...\n...\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's look:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is 1 opening parenthesis.\n\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so 2 opening parentheses.\n\n3. Continuing, until the innermost, which is (1 + 3). So, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nStarting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds an opening parenthesis. So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is layer 8, meaning a\u2081 is the innermost, a\u2082 is one layer out, up to a\u2089 being the term just inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had a\u2081\u2080 as the term just inside the outermost 3, which would make the outermost expression 3*a\u2081\u2080.\n\nBut according to the count, there are 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3, so 8 layers inside. Therefore, the innermost is a\u2081, and the term just inside the outermost 3 is a\u2089.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had a\u2081\u2080=88573, which would be the term just inside the outermost 3, making the outermost expression 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion is whether the count starts at 1 or 0. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds 1. So, with 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3, that would mean 8 layers inside. Therefore, the term just inside the outermost 3 is layer 8, which would be a\u2088.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had a\u2081 to a\u2081\u2080, which seems conflicting.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe the number of times we apply the operation 1 + 3*... is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, which is 8. Therefore, we apply the operation 8 times, starting from (1 + 3).\n\nSo, starting with x\u2080 =1.\n\nThen,\n\nx\u2081 =1 + 3*x\u2080=1 +3*1=4\n\nx\u2082=1 +3*x\u2081=1 +12=13\n\nx\u2083=1 +3*x\u2082=1 +39=40\n\nx\u2084=1 +3*x\u2083=1 +120=121\n\nx\u2085=1 +3*x\u2084=1 +363=364\n\nx\u2086=1 +3*x\u2085=1 +1092=1093\n\nx\u2087=1 +3*x\u2086=1 +3279=3280\n\nx\u2088=1 +3*x\u2087=1 +9840=9841\n\nSo, after 8 operations, we get x\u2088=9841.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*x\u2088=3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous result.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because depending on how I count the layers, I get different results. So, perhaps I need to clarify how many times the operation is applied.\n\nLet me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...).

So, the innermost is layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the term just inside the outermost 3 is layer 9, which would be x\u2089.\n\nSo, if I define x\u2080=1, then:\n\nx\u2081=1 +3*x\u2080=4\n\nx\u2082=1 +3*x\u2081=13\n\nx\u2083=1 +3*x\u2082=40\n\nx\u2084=1 +3*x\u2083=121\n\nx\u2085=1 +3*x\u2084=364\n\nx\u2086=1 +3*x\u2085=1093\n\nx\u2087=1 +3*x\u2086=3280\n\nx\u2088=1 +3*x\u2087=9841\n\nx\u2089=1 +3*x\u2088=29524\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*x\u2089=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I had 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether we start counting layers from 1 or 0.\n\nIf we consider the innermost as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds 1, up to layer 9, which is just inside the outermost 3. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*x\u2089=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, starting from a\u2081=4 up to a\u2081\u2080=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me look at the original expression again and count the number of \"1 + 3(\" terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, the number of \"1 + 3(\" increases by 1.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3 is 8.

Let me try to write this out step by step. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. \n\nLet me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, Layer 2 would be 3 times (1 + Layer 1). Layer 3 would be 3 times (1 + Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, I think. Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis adds another layer, so starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let me see: starting from the innermost, I count 9 layers because the problem has 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, when I look at the problem, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) and there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, maybe I need to compute each of these 9 layers, starting from the innermost. \n\nWait, maybe I should start by computing the innermost part first. Let's write it out step by step. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so actually, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be 3*(1 + Layer 8). So, according to my calculations above, Layer 9 is 36084. But let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1, then each subsequent Layer adds another 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps I have 9 layers in total, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so if Layer 9 is 36084, then that would be the value of the entire expression, right? Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step, I'm taking the previous layer, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and proceeding outward. So, Layer 9, the outermost, is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check my arithmetic for each step to be thorough.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420+24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 45*3=135. So 1200+135=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3. 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 28*3=84. So 30000+6000=36000, +84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that each layer is computed correctly. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me just check: the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with 9 layers. So, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which is Layer 9, which is 36084. So, that should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think if there's a way to model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each term is 3*(1 + a_n), where a_n is the nth term. So, perhaps this can be modeled as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, for n > 1, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWait, because 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - k)) * k^n + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, k = 3, c = 3.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = (a_0 - 3/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 3/(1 - 3).\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find a_0. Wait, in our case, a_1 is the first term, which is 4. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider a_0 as the term before a_1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms using the recurrence to see if it matches our earlier calculations.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*a_1 + 3 = 3*4 + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15. Correct.\n\na_3 = 3*a_2 + 3 = 3*15 + 3 = 45 + 3 = 48. Correct.\n\na_4 = 3*a_3 + 3 = 3*48 + 3 = 144 + 3 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the recurrence works.\n\nTo solve the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's take n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = (8/2) + (3/2) = 11/2\n\nSo, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3^3 is 27, so for n=4, 3^{4-1} = 3^3 = 27.\n\nSo, a_4 = (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, the value would be a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\nLet me compute 10*6561 = 65610, plus 1*6561 = 6561, so total is 65610 + 6561 = 72171.\n\nThen subtract 3: 72171 - 3 = 72168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. So, the value of the 9th layer is 36084.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 36084.\n\nWait a second, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3(...) terms: starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis after 3(1+...). Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times. So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nSo, the calculation for a_9 is correct, resulting in 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach would be to recognize that each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since the number of layers is manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time, the term is 3*(1 + something), which can be expanded as 3*1 + 3*(something). So, perhaps we can expand the entire expression step by step, but that might get complicated quickly.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression a bit to see if a pattern emerges. Let's see:\n\nStarting with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can express each term as 3*(1 + previous term). So, each term is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_{n} is the nth term.\n\nSo, in the end, the 9th term is 3*(1 + a_8) = 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but given the structure, it's more of a recursive sequence rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this expression step by step, from the inside out, and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, the 9th layer is 36084, which is the value of the entire expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each term as adding 3^k, but let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the expansion:\n\nAfter Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\n\nAfter Layer 2: 15 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nAfter Layer 3: 48 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nAfter Layer 4: 147 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nWait, but when I look at these numbers, they seem to follow a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous plus 3, which is the same as the recurrence relation I had earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps another way to express the nth term is as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWhich is exactly what I had before, leading to the formula a_n = (11*3^{n} - 3)/2, but wait, no, when n=1, a_1 = 4, so let me make sure.\n\nWait, earlier, I had a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2, so for n=9, it's (11*3^8 - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added constant. However, since each term is 3*(1 + previous term), it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps if I unroll the expression, I can write it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, ..., E9, where E1 is the innermost.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nE9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, E9 is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express each E_n as 3^{n} * (something). Let me see:\n\nFrom the formula, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2, so for E9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a sum of 3^k terms, but I'm not sure if that's the most straightforward approach here. It seems that using the recurrence relation and solving it is a more efficient method, especially since the number of layers is manageable.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k, but let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, each time we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + something), which is 3*1 + 3*(something). So, maybe if I expand all the way, I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms, but I'm not sure if that would be simpler.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*1 + 3*E1 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*1 + 3*E2 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147\n\nE5 = 3 + 3*147 = 3 + 441 = 444\n\nE6 = 3 + 3*444 = 3 + 1332 = 1335\n\nE7 = 3 + 3*1335 = 3 + 4005 = 4008\n\nE8 = 3 + 3*4008 = 3 + 12024 = 12027\n\nE9 = 3 + 3*12027 = 3 + 36081 = 36084\n\nWait, so each En can be expressed as 3 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nWhich is consistent with the recurrence relation we had before: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nSo, perhaps if I expand E9, it would be 3 + 3*E8 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*E7) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*E7 = 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*E7.\n\nContinuing this expansion, each time, I'm adding another 3^k term, multiplied by the next E.\n\nBut this seems like it would get too complicated quickly, so perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recurrence formula.\n\nIn any case, after carefully computing each layer step by step, and verifying with the recurrence relation and its closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression evaluates to 36084.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Verification**: Using a recurrence relation and solving it, we confirm that the 9th layer evaluates to 36084.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value of the expression is $\\boxed{36084}$."

Starting from the innermost part:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n2. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 2).\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but let me check.\n\nWait, no, let's look again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each inner part is 1 + 3*(next inner part). So, maybe I can compute each innermost expression first and work my way outwards. Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then that's inside another 1+3*(...), and so on. Let me count how many times this happens. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time we have a 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1+3). Then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)), and so on. Let me count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the first 3*(...), there are 8 more 1+3*(...) layers. Wait, no, perhaps I can count the number of 3*(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's count how many layers there are.\n\nLet me try to parse this:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd this goes on until Layer 9, perhaps? Wait, let me see. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so let's count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(...), there are 8 more layers. Wait, perhaps I can think of it as 9 layers in total. Let me check.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, starting from Layer 1, then Layer 2, etc., up to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time there's a 1 + 3*(...), so how many times does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost expression is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so let me count how many times 3*(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first 1+3.

Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's see: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions inside the main 3*(...). Let's see:\n\n- The first layer is 1 + 3*(...)\n- Then another 1 + 3*(...)\n- And so on, until there are 9 such layers, right?\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + 3*(...). Each time there's a 1 + 3*(..., so each time a new layer starts. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me consider the general form:\n\nLet\u2019s say we have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^n*(a_0 - c/(1 - r)).\n\nWait, but in this case, c = 1, r = 3, and a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Wait, actually, the first term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as I computed earlier.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + 3^n*(a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)).\n\nWait, but 1/(1 - 3) is -1/2, so a_n = (-1/2) + 3^n*(4 - (-1/2)) = (-1/2) + 3^n*(9/2).\n\nSimplify: a_n = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^n.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\na_1 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^1 = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3 = (-1/2) + (27/2) = (26/2) = 13. Wait, but a_1 is supposed to be 4. Hmm, that's not matching. So, perhaps my general formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the initial conditions. Let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, to solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, that matches my earlier calculations.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, which is the Layer 9 we need, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm it's 59049.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n- Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n- For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n- Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and the formula using the recurrence relation seems to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6.

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". That seems like a good starting point. Let me write that down: Innermost expression: 1 + 3. Okay, so 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me compute that. So, if the innermost was 4, then the next one is 1 + 3*4. Let me calculate that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that step gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so that's 40. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*40. Let me do that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, so now I'm at 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Wow, that's a jump. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me see, 3*1093 is... 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. Okay, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Wow, that's a big number. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Okay, so now I'm at 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, plus 1 is 88573. Hmm, that's 88573. Next layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573. Breaking it down: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, plus 1 is 265720. Okay, so that's 265720. Now, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let me calculate that: 3*265720. Let's break it down: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, plus 1 is 797161. That's a huge number. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*797161. Let me compute that: 3*797161. Breaking it down: 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, plus 1 is 2391484. Wow, that's 2,391,484. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*2,391,484. Let me compute that: 3*2,391,484. Let's break it down: 3*2,000,000 is 6,000,000, 3*391,484. Wait, maybe it's better to compute 3*2,391,484 directly. Let me do that: 2,391,484 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2. 4*3=12 +2=14, carryover 1. 1*3=3 +1=4. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 3*3=9 +2=11, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 7,174,452. Then, adding 1 gives us 7,174,453. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2,391,484 * 3: Let's compute it step by step:\n\n2,391,484\n*          3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carryover 1.\n1*3=3 +1=4, write down 4.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 7,174,452. Then, adding 1: 7,174,452 +1=7,174,453. Okay, so that's correct. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, which is the original expression: 3*(the result we just got). So, that's 3*7,174,453. Let me compute that. 7,174,453 *3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n7,174,453\n*          3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3=9.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carryover 1.\n7*3=21 +1=22, write down 2, carryover 2.\n1*3=3 +2=5.\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\n1*3=3 +2=5.\n7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2.\nThere's no more digits, so write down 2.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n3 *3 =9. So, units place is 9.\nNext digit: 5*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext: 4*3=12 +1=13. Write down 3, carryover 1.\nNext: 7*3=21 +1=22. Write down 2, carryover 2.\nNext: 1*3=3 +2=5. Write down 5.\nNext: 4*3=12. Wait, no, the next digit is 4? Wait, no, let me check the number again: 7,174,453.\n\nWait, I think I might have misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n7,174,453 is:\n\nMillions:7, Hundred thousands:1, Ten thousands:7, Thousands:4, Hundreds:4, Tens:5, Units:3.\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nUnits:3*3=9\n\nTens:5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\nHundreds:4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carryover 1\n\nThousands:4*3=12 +1=13, write down 3, carryover 1\n\nTen thousands:7*3=21 +1=22, write down 2, carryover 2\n\nHundred thousands:1*3=3 +2=5, write down 5\n\nMillions:7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\nSince there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo putting it all together from left to right: 21,523,359.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n7,174,453 *3:\n\n7,000,000 *3=21,000,000\n\n174,453 *3: Let's compute that.\n\n174,453 *3:\n\n100,000*3=300,000\n\n70,000*3=210,000\n\n4,000*3=12,000\n\n400*3=1,200\n\n50*3=150\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding those together: 300,000 +210,000=510,000 +12,000=522,000 +1,200=523,200 +150=523,350 +9=523,359.\n\nSo, 7,000,000*3=21,000,000 and 174,453*3=523,359. Adding those together: 21,000,000 +523,359=21,523,359.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*7,174,453=21,523,359.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, the final result is 21,523,359. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations along the way. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each step quickly again to check.\n\nInnermost:1+3=4\n\nNext:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nNext:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nNext:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nNext:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nNext:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nNext:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nNext:1+3*29524=1+88572=88573\n\nNext:1+3*88573=1+265719=265720\n\nNext:1+3*265720=1+797160=797161\n\nNext:1+3*797161=1+2391483=2391484\n\nNext:1+3*2391484=1+7174452=7174453\n\nFinally, 3*7174453=21523359.\n\nWait, earlier I wrote 21,523,359, but in the final step, I wrote 21,523,359. Wait, 21,523,359 is correct because 7,174,453*3=21,523,359. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think I did each step correctly. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. Then, after reaching the outermost layer, I multiplied that result by 3. So, the final answer should be 21,523,359. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Let me try to count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...) around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nLooking at the expression, I see that each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3s before I get to the innermost 1 + 3. Starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each layer adds another 3. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n2. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n3. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n4. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n5. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n6. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n7. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n8. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n9. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \n10. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Each time, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times something). So, if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each inner expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on.\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, L3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by L9, so:\n\nTotal = 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the problem again: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, that seems off. Actually, each \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the first 3. So, starting from the first 3, the next is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, etc., until the innermost part. Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, in total, there are 9 layers, meaning I need to compute from L1 up to L9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to L9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me confirm if that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I started, I thought L1 was the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then L2=1+3*4=13, L3=1+3*13=40, L4=1+3*40=121, L5=1+3*121=364, L6=1+3*364=1093, L7=1+3*1093=3280, L8=1+3*3280=9841, L9=1+3*9841=29524. Then total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, making sure I get each one right.\n\nLet me write them out again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 3*L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but that might not be the correct way. Alternatively, let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I have 9 layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3's after the initial 3. Each layer adds a 3. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 3( before that. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, as each \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer. So, L1 to L9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I'm not missing any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, which means that the innermost part is (1+3), and then each layer adds another 3(...). So, in total, 9 layers, which I computed as L1 to L9.\n\nSo, with L9 being 29,524, and then the total expression is 3*L9, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a similar expression but with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute this:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother test case: three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich also matches.\n\nSo, my approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem with nine layers, I get 88,572 as the result.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. Each step seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each step manually is feasible and less error-prone.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving it this way to confirm.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nThus, both methods confirm that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't find any errors in my reasoning, and the test cases with smaller numbers worked out correctly. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next layer: \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " That sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's 40. Let's keep going. Next layer is another 1 + 3 times the previous number:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that's 121. Okay, moving outward again:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, 364. Next layer:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWhoa, that's getting big. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that becomes the next layer. Let me keep track step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nSo far, I have:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nWait, that's six layers so far. Let me check how many layers there are in total. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so maybe there are nine layers? Let me count.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers. So, I've done six layers, so I have three more to go.\n\nContinuing:\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so after the ninth layer, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, let me compute that:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29524.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way to be sure. Maybe I can multiply 29524 by 3 directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count extra.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, each time, I'm moving one layer out, so for nine layers, I should have nine computations. Let me list them:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the innermost expression after nine layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, that should be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be represented as a geometric series or something similar, which could lead to a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, let's say a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nUsing the general solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSetting them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition:\n\n4 = 3A + (-1/2)\n\nSo, 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the repeating pattern.\n\n2. Compute each layer from the innermost outwards, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution.\n\n4. Verify the formula with known values to ensure it's correct.\n\n5. Use the formula to compute the result for the ninth layer.\n\n6. Multiply the final inner result by 3 to get the overall result.\n\nThroughout this process, I made sure to double-check each computation step and even cross-validated using a different method (the recurrence relation) to ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors. It's easy to get lost in the layers and miscalculate, so having a systematic approach and checking each step helps prevent mistakes.\n\nAnother thing I considered was whether there's a more efficient way than computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. The recurrence relation approach is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. However, since nine isn't too bad, even computing each step wasn't too time-consuming.\n\nI also thought about whether this kind of expression could be represented as a geometric series. Let me explore that for a moment. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I expand it, it would be 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), but that seems to lead back to the same structure. Alternatively, maybe expanding the entire expression would reveal a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let's try expanding it a bit. Let me write the entire expression step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to express this as a sum, it's a bit tricky because each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But using the recurrence relation, I found a closed-form solution, which is much more efficient.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully working through each layer and verifying my computations, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last term, which is just 1+3. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, that was easy. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so the next layer would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the innermost was 4, the next one would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Hmm, okay, so that layer gives me 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(the previous result), which is 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, now I have 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, that's 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, so now I have 364. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, that's getting bigger. \n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let me do that: 3*1093 is... let me calculate, 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Wow, that's a big number. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. That's 9841. \n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate that. 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9524*3 is... let me see, 9000*3 is 27000, 524*3 is 1572, so 27000 + 1572 is 28572. So, 60000 + 28572 is 88572. Plus 1 is 88573. \n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check that again. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then plus 1 is 88573. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*88573: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, plus 1 is 265720.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me verify: 3*88573. Let me compute 88573*3 step by step. 88573 * 3: 3*3 is 9, write down 9. 3*7 is 21, carry over 2. 3*5 is 15 plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 3*8 is 24 plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2. 3*8 is 24 plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2. But since there are no more digits, write down 2. So, 265719. Then plus 1 is 265720. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute that. 3*265720: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. So, adding those: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Plus 1 is 797161.\n\nWait, hold on again. Let me check 3*265720. 265720 * 3: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. So, adding them: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, plus 1 is 797161. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*797161. Let me compute that. 3*797161: 700000*3 is 2100000, 90000*3 is 270000, 7000*3 is 21000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, plus 1 is 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again. 797161 * 3: 700000*3 is 2,100,000; 90,000*3 is 270,000; 7,000*3 is 21,000; 100*3 is 300; 60*3 is 180; 1*3 is 3. So, 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000. 2,370,000 + 21,000 is 2,391,000. 2,391,000 + 300 is 2,391,300. 2,391,300 + 180 is 2,391,480. 2,391,480 + 3 is 2,391,483. Then, plus 1 is 2,391,484. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*2,391,484. Let me compute that. 3*2,391,484: Let me break it down. 2,000,000*3 is 6,000,000; 300,000*3 is 900,000; 90,000*3 is 270,000; 1,000*3 is 3,000; 400*3 is 1,200; 80*3 is 240; 4*3 is 12. So, adding those up: 6,000,000 + 900,000 is 6,900,000. 6,900,000 + 270,000 is 7,170,000. 7,170,000 + 3,000 is 7,173,000. 7,173,000 + 1,200 is 7,174,200. 7,174,200 + 240 is 7,174,440. 7,174,440 + 12 is 7,174,452. Then, plus 1 is 7,174,453.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. 2,391,484 * 3: 2,000,000*3 is 6,000,000; 300,000*3 is 900,000; 90,000*3 is 270,000; 1,000*3 is 3,000; 400*3 is 1,200; 80*3 is 240; 4*3 is 12. Adding: 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000; +270,000 = 7,170,000; +3,000 = 7,173,000; +1,200 = 7,174,200; +240 = 7,174,440; +12 = 7,174,452. Plus 1 is 7,174,453. That seems right.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*7,174,453. Let me compute that. 3*7,174,453: Let's break it down. 7,000,000*3 is 21,000,000; 100,000*3 is 300,000; 70,000*3 is 210,000; 4,000*3 is 12,000; 400*3 is 1,200; 50*3 is 150; 3*3 is 9. So, adding those up: 21,000,000 + 300,000 is 21,300,000. 21,300,000 + 210,000 is 21,510,000. 21,510,000 + 12,000 is 21,522,000. 21,522,000 + 1,200 is 21,523,200. 21,523,200 + 150 is 21,523,350. 21,523,350 + 9 is 21,523,359. Then, plus 1 is 21,523,360.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 7,174,453 * 3: 7,000,000*3 is 21,000,000; 100,000*3 is 300,000; 70,000*3 is 210,000; 4,000*3 is 12,000; 400*3 is 1,200; 50*3 is 150; 3*3 is 9. So, adding: 21,000,000 + 300,000 = 21,300,000; +210,000 = 21,510,000; +12,000 = 21,522,000; +1,200 = 21,523,200; +150 = 21,523,350; +9 = 21,523,359. Then, plus 1 is 21,523,360.

Adding those up: 60,000,000 + 3,000,000 is 63,000,000. 63,000,000 + 1,500,000 is 64,500,000. 64,500,000 + 60,000 is 64,560,000. 64,560,000 + 9,000 is 64,569,000. 64,569,000 + 900 is 64,569,900. 64,569,900 + 180 is 64,570,080. Plus 1 is 64,570,081.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 21,523,360 * 3: 20,000,000*3 is 60,000,000; 1,000,000*3 is 3,000,000; 500,000*3 is 1,500,000; 20,000*3 is 60,000; 3,000*3 is 9,000; 300*3 is 900; 60*3 is 180; 0*3 is 0.

Then, plus 1 is 5,230,176,601. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*5,230,176,601. Let me compute that. 3*5,230,176,601: Let me break it down. 5,000,000,000*3 is 15,000,000,000; 200,000,000*3 is 600,000,000; 30,000,000*3 is 90,000,000; 1,000,000*3 is 3,000,000; 70,000*3 is 210,000; 6,000*3 is 18,000; 600*3 is 1,800; 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 15,000,000,000 + 600,000,000 is 15,600,000,000. 15,600,000,000 + 90,000,000 is 15,690,000,000. 15,690,000,000 + 3,000,000 is 15,693,000,000. 15,693,000,000 + 210,000 is 15,693,210,000. 15,693,210,000 + 18,000 is 15,693,228,000. 15,693,228,000 + 1,800 is 15,693,229,800. 15,693,229,800 + 3 is 15,693,229,803. Then, plus 1 is 15,693,229,804.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 5,230,176,601 * 3: 5,000,000,000*3 is 15,000,000,000; 200,000,000*3 is 600,000,000; 30,000,000*3 is 90,000,000; 1,000,000*3 is 3,000,000; 70,000*3 is 210,00"

    "text": " That usually helps with nested expressions. So, let's start from the innermost part and work our way out. The innermost part is the last term: 1+3. That should be easy. Let me write that down: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost parentheses equals 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that step gives me 13. Alright, moving out another layer, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, it's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, okay, so now I'm at 40. Let me make sure I'm keeping track of each step correctly. So far, we've done three layers, right? Let me recount: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then the next is 1+3*4=13, then the next is 1+3*13=40. Yeah, that seems right. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 40. So, 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, so now we're at 121. Let me note that down. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that. 3*121 is... let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, that step gives me 364. Hmm, getting bigger each time. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Okay, so now we're at 1093. Let me confirm that step again: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is indeed 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Yep, that's correct. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that. 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Okay, so that's 9841. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that. 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that step gives me 88573. Now, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, we have 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 88573*3: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies down to 265719. Let me just quickly recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, multiplying the final result by 3: 3*88573 = 265719. That seems consistent. I don't think I made any multiplication errors, but let me double-check a couple of the steps to be sure. For example, step 6: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Step 10: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Correct. Then, 3*88573: 88573*3. Let's see, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding them: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did all the steps correctly. It's a long expression, but by breaking it down layer by layer and computing each step carefully, I arrived at the final result of 265719. I don't think I missed any steps or made any calculation errors, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 88573 = 265719\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. The very last part is (1+3), right? So, let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that middle part simplifies to 13. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm replacing the innermost parentheses with its value and then moving outward. So, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. Hmm, so that part becomes 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 plus 120 is 121. Okay, so now we have 121. The next step is 1 + 3*(121). Let me calculate that. 3 times 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. \n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3*(364). Let's see, 3 times 364 is... let me compute that. 364 times 3: 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3 times 1093. Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. \n\nNext, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, and 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. \n\nContinuing further, the next expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3 times 9841. Hmm, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. \n\nNow, moving outward again, the next part is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3 times 29524. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. \n\nFinally, the outermost part of the expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 times 88573. Let me compute that. 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573 times 3: 3 times 3 is 9, 3 times 7 is 21, so write down 1 and carry over 2. 3 times 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 3 times 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, write down 5 and carry over 2. 3 times 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 3 times 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25. So, writing that down, it's 265719. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, each step simplifies the innermost parentheses first, and then each subsequent layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. After working through each layer step by step, the final result is 265719. I think that's the correct answer. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me quickly recap the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, I think I can confidently say that the result of the expression is 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " That makes sense because each part is dependent on the next one, so starting from the inside will help me build up the solution step by step. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses, it looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, which means I'll need to compute nine layers. That sounds a bit tedious, but if I take it one step at a time, it should be manageable. Maybe I can start by assigning a variable to each level to make it easier. Let's denote each innermost expression as follows: Let me start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer is built by 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try to formalize that. Let\u2019s define L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9. Finally, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, I need to compute L1 through L9 step by step. Let me compute each layer one by one. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple enough. Now, moving to L2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 is 13. Next, L3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. L3 is 40. Moving on to L4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. L4 is 121. Now, L5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, L5 is 364. Next, L6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. L6 is 1093. Now, L7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. L7 is 3280. Moving on to L8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L8 is 9841. Finally, L9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Therefore, L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think I did everything right. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped. Each time, I just multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric progression kind of situation.

    "text": " That usually seems to work with these kinds of nested expressions. So, let me try to start from the innermost part and work my way out. \n\nLet me rewrite the expression so I can see it more clearly. Starting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). So, if I start from the inside and work out, each step will involve computing a smaller expression first. Let me number these layers to keep track. I'll label them from the innermost as layer 1 up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses before the innermost (1+3). Hmm, but when I count from the inside, each layer adds another set. Maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost (1+3) as layer 1, then each layer going out adds another 3(1+3(...)). So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer 2: 3*(1 + layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, that seems to be a pattern. Let me see if I can generalize this.\n\nSo, each layer is defined as follows: layer n = 3*(1 + layer (n-1)). So, starting from layer 1, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer 3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer 4 is 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer 5 is 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer 6 is 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer 7 is 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer 8 is 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer 9 is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after layer 9, we have another 3 multiplied by the result of layer 9. So, the total expression would be 3*(layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. Hmm, but let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. Wait, but when I count the layers, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). From the innermost, each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 48. Layer 4: 147. Layer 5: 444. Layer 6: 1335. Layer 7: 4008. Layer 8: 12027. Layer 9: 36084. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 108252. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9. So, layer 1 to layer 9, as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is defined by a recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form solution. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me define the expression recursively. Let\u2019s denote E(n) as the expression with n layers. So, E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, as before. E(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 4. Let me expand this:\n\nE(n) = 3 + 3*E(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is E(n) - 3*E(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution E_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n\n-2*A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is E(n) = E_h(n) + E_p(n) = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1.5\n\n3*C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333\n\nThus, the solution is E(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^n)/6\n\nSimilarly, 3/2 is just 3/2.\n\nSo, E(n) = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2.\n\nLet me simplify this further:\n\nE(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nBecause 3/2 = 9/6, so subtracting 9/6 from (11*3^n)/6 gives (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nSo, E(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nE(1) = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula seems to work. So, for n=9, which is our case, E(9) = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, E(9) = (11*19683 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\nLet me compute 19683*10 = 196830\n\nPlus 19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nSo, 11*19683 = 216513\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216504 / 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 * 36084 = 216504\n\nSo, E(9) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(E(9)) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed layer by layer, I got E(9) = 36084, and then the total expression is 3*36084 = 108252. So, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, E(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6, so for n=9, E(9)=36084, then total expression is 3*E(9)=108252.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(E(9)) = 3*((11*3^9 - 9)/6) = (33*3^9 - 27)/6 = (3^1 * 11*3^9 - 27)/6 = (11*3^10 - 27)/6.\n\nWait, 33*3^9 is 11*3^1*3^9 = 11*3^10.\n\nSo, 3*(E(9)) = (11*3^10 - 27)/6.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^9=19683, so 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, 11*59049 = Let's compute that.\n\n59049 * 10 = 590490\n\n59049 *1 = 59049\n\nTotal: 590490 + 59049 = 649539.\n\nThen, subtract 27: 649539 -27=649512.\n\nDivide by 6: 649512 /6=108252.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, the final answer is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do a lot of steps, I might make an arithmetic error. Let me verify E(9)=36084.\n\nFrom the formula: E(9)=(11*3^9 -9)/6= (11*19683 -9)/6.\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683*10=196830\n\n19683*1=19683\n\nTotal: 196830 +19683=216513\n\n216513 -9=216504\n\n216504 /6=36084. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*36084=108252. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using another approach, such as expanding the expression step by step without using the formula, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)=4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 +4)=15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 +15)=48.\n\nLayer 4:3*(1 +48)=147.\n\nLayer5:3*(1 +147)=444.\n\nLayer6:3*(1 +444)=1335.\n\nLayer7:3*(1 +1335)=4008.\n\nLayer8:3*(1 +4008)=12027.\n\nLayer9:3*(1 +12027)=36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084)=108252.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I feel confident that the answer is 108252.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:3*(1+4)=3*5=15.\n\nLayer3:3*(1+15)=3*16=48.\n\nLayer4:3*(1+48)=3*49=147.\n\nLayer5:3*(1+147)=3*148=444.\n\nLayer6:3*(1+444)=3*445=1335.\n\nLayer7:3*(1+1335)=3*1336=4008.\n\nLayer8:3*(1+4008)=3*4009=12027.\n\nLayer9:3*(1+12027)=3*12028=36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084)=108252.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined as 3 times (1 plus the next layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next. Using a recursive approach or a derived formula confirms that the final result is 108,252.\n\n$\\boxed{108252}$"

So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), I can work my way outward.

Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1\n3. Layer 3: 3*(Layer 2) + 1\n...\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9).

Let's try that.\n\nLet me write down each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that with actual multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, I think I did each step correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\nSimplify 3*A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n, so:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with Layer 1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can compute the result without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if there were more layers.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the sum can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, the closed-form formula is more efficient.\n\nLet me just recap the steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n3. Notice the recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer directly.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute Layer 9.\n\n5. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps thoroughly and checked each computation to ensure accuracy.

    "text": " That sounds like a good plan. So, let's start from the inside and work our way out. \n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out is 3 times (1+3). Wait, no, actually, let me look again. The innermost is (1+3), which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer becomes 13. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. \n\nNext, we have 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3 times 121 first. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, that's 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(364). Let's calculate 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, that's 1093. \n\nNext layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. Well, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, that's 3280. \n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, that's 9841. \n\nNext layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that's 29524. \n\nContinuing outward, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's 88573. \n\nNext layer is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, that's 265720. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. So, that's 797161. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*797161. Let me compute that. 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483. Wait, let me double-check that because it's a big number and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again quickly to see if everything adds up.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. 1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. 1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. 1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n10. 1+3*29524=1+88572=88573\n11. 1+3*88573=1+265719=265720\n12. 1+3*265720=1+797160=797161\n13. Finally, 3*797161=2391483\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 2,391,483.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1, leading to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{2391483}$"

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another 3 times something). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I have 1+3(...), so I think there are nine layers here because each \"1+\" is a new layer. Wait, actually, let me check. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see: starting from the left, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), and each subsequent 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me see: the innermost part is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, 1+3, then 3*(1+3), then 3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, until we have nine layers. So, there are nine layers of 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). That seems correct. So, to solve this, I can start from the innermost layer and compute each layer step by step, moving outward. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Continuing this way, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Let's see, 9841*3. Let me compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, L9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524*3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculation again because 29,524*3 should be straightforward. Let me do it digit by digit: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (L1). Then 1+3*4=13 (L2). Then 1+3*13=40 (L3). Then 1+3*40=121 (L4). Then 1+3*121=364 (L5). Then 1+3*364=1093 (L6). Then 1+3*1093=3280 (L7). Then 1+3*3280=9841 (L8). Then 1+3*9841=29,524 (L9). Then 3*29,524=88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see the entire expression as a geometric series, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Each term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which seems to be a repeated multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Since there are nine layers, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine 1s? Wait, no, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds a 1 and a 3. So, perhaps the total expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see that. If I have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, solving this recurrence, as I did earlier, gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me think. Since each layer is a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, expanding this, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 +3*(1 +3)=1+3+9=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Wait, that seems to be the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 +3^2 +3^3. Let me check: 1 +3 +9 +27=40, which is a_3=40. Similarly, a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +3*40=1 +120=121=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121. So, it seems that a_n is the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +... +3^{n}. Wait, but for a_1=4=1+3=4, which is sum up to 3^1. a_2=13=1+3+9= sum up to 3^2. a_3=40=1+3+9+27= sum up to 3^3. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I found earlier. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms multiplied by some coefficients. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). Let me expand this step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me write E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me compute the innermost part first: 1+3=4. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by some coefficients. Let me see: Each time I expand a layer, I'm adding another term. For example, when I expand E, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). Let me expand it step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost first:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524\n\nThen, E = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I need to verify. Let me see, when I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to distribute the 3s:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)).\n\nBut that seems similar to the original structure. Alternatively, maybe I can write E as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^10. Wait, let me check:\n\nIf I expand E, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). Let me see:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but each layer adds another 3. Let me see:\n\nFirst, the innermost is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*(4)=13.\n\nThen, 1 +3*(13)=40.\n\nEach time, the term being added is 3 times the previous layer. So, if I expand all the layers, E would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)))).\n\nLet me try to write E as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))).\n\nIf I distribute the 3s, it would be:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms.\n\nWait, but that would be 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, but 3^0 is 1, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, up to 3^9=19,683.\n\nWait, but in our case, E is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nWait, let's see: Let me define E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me see if E can be expressed as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 59,049 (which is 3^10). The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where r=3, and n=10 terms.\n\nSo, sum = (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2=29,524.\n\nWait, that's exactly a_9, which we computed earlier. Then, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it: E = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11}=177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, E=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of E as the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, but that would be (3^{11} -3)/2, which is the same as above.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so if n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29,524, which is a_9. Then, E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use induction to verify that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBase case: n=1, a_1=4. (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nAssume a_k = (3^{k+1}-1)/2. Then, a_{k+1}=1 +3*a_k=1 +3*((3^{k+1}-1)/2)=1 + (3^{k+2}-3)/2= (2 +3^{k+2} -3)/2= (3^{k+2} -1)/2, which is the formula for a_{k+1}. So, by induction, the formula holds for all n.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29,524.\n\nThus, E=3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, after all these methods and checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " That usually makes sense with nested expressions because you can't really evaluate the outer layers until you know the value of the inner ones. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: Innermost: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3 times that innermost part). So, the next layer is: (1 + 3*(innermost result)). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another (1 + 3 times the previous result). So, that's (1 + 3*13). Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer simplifies to 40. Continuing outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So, this becomes 121. Next layer: (1 + 3*121). Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. So, this is 364. Moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*364). Let's see, 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, this simplifies to 1093. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, this becomes 3280. Moving outward again, we have (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, this layer is 9841. Now, the next layer is (1 + 3*9841). Let me calculate 3*9841: 9841*3 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. Therefore, this part simplifies to 29524. Moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*29524). Calculating that: 3*29524 is 88572, so 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, this becomes 88573. Next layer: (1 + 3*88573). Let's compute 3*88573: 88573*3 is 265,719, so 1 + 265,719 is 265,720. So, this layer is 265,720. Now, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*265,720). Calculating that: 3*265,720 is 797,160, so 1 + 797,160 is 797,161. Therefore, the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses simplifies to 797,161. But wait, the original problem is 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, the entire problem is 3*(797,161). Let me compute that: 797,161*3. Let me break that down: 700,000*3 is 2,100,000; 97,000*3 is 291,000; 161*3 is 483. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 291,000 is 2,391,000; then 2,391,000 + 483 is 2,391,483. So, the final result is 2,391,483. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then (1+3*4)=13. Then (1+3*13)=40. Then (1+3*40)=121. Then (1+3*121)=364. Then (1+3*364)=1093. Then (1+3*1093)=3280. Then (1+3*3280)=9841. Then (1+3*9841)=29524. Then (1+3*29524)=88573. Then (1+3*88573)=265720. Then (1+3*265720)=797161. Then 3*797161=2,391,483. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check one more time, maybe I missed a step or miscalculated somewhere. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1+3)=4. 2. (1+3*4)=13. 3. (1+3*13)=40. 4. (1+3*40)=121. 5. (1+3*121)=364. 6. (1+3*364)=1093. 7. (1+3*1093)=3280. 8. (1+3*3280)=9841. 9. (1+3*9841)=29524. 10. (1+3*29524)=88573. 11. (1+3*88573)=265720. 12. (1+3*265720)=797161. 13. Finally, 3*797161=2,391,483. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2,391,483. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " That usually seems to work with nested expressions. So, let me try that approach.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, okay, so starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that part, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The innermost parentheses was the last (1 + 3), so replacing that with 4. Now, moving one step out, the next layer is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4\n\n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure. The next innermost after replacing the last (1 + 3) was (1 + 3(4)) which became 13. So now, the next layer is (1 + 3(13)). Let me compute that.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, now the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that.\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nSo, the expression now is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))\n\nWait, no, let me check. After replacing (1 + 3(40)) with 121, the next layer is (1 + 3*121). Let's compute that.\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\nWait, no, let's correct that. After replacing (1 + 3(40)) with 121, the next layer is (1 + 3*121) which is 364, so the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recount. Each time, I'm moving one layer out, so after replacing the innermost, each step should be the next layer out. Let me try to list each step clearly to avoid confusion.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*88573\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has multiple layers, each time a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I'm replacing one layer, so let me count the number of times I can see \"1 + 3(\" before the first \"1 + 3\". Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on, until we have 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Because from the innermost, each time we go out, we're adding another layer until we reach the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I only went up to 11 steps, but maybe I miscounted. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Layer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer10) = 3*88573\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), so after computing up to Layer10, which is 88573, the final step is 3*88573.\n\nSo, let me compute that: 3*88573.\n\nFirst, compute 88573 * 3:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9, write down 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\nBut wait, 88573 is a 5-digit number. Let me compute step by step:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\nBut wait, there's no more digits, so the carry over 2 becomes 26, so the result is 265,719.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 88573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, so write 1, carryover 2\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2\nBut since we're done with digits, the carryover 2 becomes the next digit, so the total is 265,719.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 88573 * 3:\n\n80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n70 * 3 = 210\n3 * 3 = 9\nAdding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Sometimes when I compute step by step, especially with so many layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recount each layer:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Layer10: 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\n11. Final step: 3*88,573 = 265,719\n\nWait, okay, that seems consistent. Each layer is correctly computed, and the final multiplication gives 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 10 layers of 1 + 3*(...), so n=10.\n\nWait, no, let me see: starting from the innermost as layer1, up to layer10, which is the 10th layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the final step is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 265,719 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWhich can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this, we can express a_n as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*a_1\n\nBut since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, we can see that each term is building up a sum.\n\nAlternatively, since we found a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, that might be the most straightforward way.\n\nIn any case, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 265,719.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure that each step is correct.\n\nUsing a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=10: (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd finally, 3*88573 = 265,719 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, leading to the final result after evaluating all layers and multiplying by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute each layer efficiently, confirming that the final answer is 265,719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me start by identifying how many layers there are here. I'll count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. Starting from the left, the first part is 3(1+3(...)). Each time, there's another 1+3(...). Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine layers of parentheses. That means I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and work my way back to the first. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is the 9th layer: 1+3. That seems straightforward. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Let me note that down as Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, that's Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, Layer 8 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives me 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 7 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 6 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so adding those together, 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. Layer 4 is 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so adding those gives 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 3 is 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so adding those together gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 2 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 1: 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me calculate that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. So, Layer 1 is 29523.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many layers. Let's go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841=29523. Correct.\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer's result is used correctly in the next outer layer. Therefore, the final result after computing all layers is 29523.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation, especially since it's a repeated structure. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). This seems like a nested multiplication where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 being the innermost term, which is 4 in this case. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I went up to Layer 9 being 4, then Layer 8 being 13, and so on until Layer 1 being 29523. But if I consider a_1 as the innermost, which is 4, then a_2 would be 13, and so on until a_9. So, the entire expression would be 3*a_9, but in my calculation, I ended up with 29523 as Layer 1, which is 3*a_9 where a_9 is 9841. Wait, that seems inconsistent because 3*9841 is 29523, which matches my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, as we saw. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, the total number of layers is 9, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had Layer 9 as 4, which is a_1, and then Layer 8 as 13, which is a_2, etc., so that a_9 would be the innermost term, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, each layer outwards adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), and the innermost is 9 layers deep.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a_1 being the innermost, a_2 being the next layer, up to a_9 being the outermost. But in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the outermost is 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, the number of layers inside the 3* is 8, because the first 3*( starts at the first layer, and then each inner layer adds another 3*(...). Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let's count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...) terms. Starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, each time, after the first 3*, there's a 1 + 3*(...), and each of those has another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the first 3*(, then inside that is 1 + 3*(, then inside that is another 1 + 3*(, and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many 1 + 3*(...)? Let me see: The first 3*( has one 1 + 3*(...), then inside that is another 1 + 3*(...), and so on until the ninth layer. Wait, perhaps it's 8 layers inside the first 3*(, making a total of 9 layers. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because the first 3*( is followed by 8 more 1 + 3*(...) terms. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nWait, let me write the expression step by step, each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3\n\nSo, each layer after the first is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 9, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so that seems correct. So, the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost as Layer 9 up to Layer 1, which is the outermost. So, the final result is 29523.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's consider that each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step, as I did earlier, since n is only 9. Alternatively, we can note that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence, K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Wait, that's different from my earlier result of 29523. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the general formula?\n\nWait, let's check n=9 with the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. But in my step-by-step calculation, I got a_9 as 9841, which when multiplied by 3 gives 29523. Wait, that suggests that my general formula is giving me a different result, which means I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The expression in the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, in the formula, a_n is defined as starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, which is 4, as a_1. Then, a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, which is 13, and so on up to a_9, which would be the value at the first 3*(...). But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then the total expression is 3*29524=88572, which contradicts my earlier step-by-step result of 29523.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There's a mistake here. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I derived is for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, so a_1 is the innermost layer. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the value after 9 layers. But according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 would be 88572, which is way larger than my step-by-step result of 29523. That means I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, but in the problem, the outermost term is 3*(a_9), so maybe the formula should be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, let me try to re-examine the recurrence. If I define a_n as the value at the nth layer, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, for n=9, a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. So, the general solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I derived earlier. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. But that's conflicting with my step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 29523. That suggests that my step-by-step approach was wrong.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 4, Layer 8 as 13, Layer 7 as 40, Layer 6 as 121, Layer 5 as 364, Layer 4 as 1093, Layer 3 as 3280, Layer 2 as 9841, and Layer 1 as 3*9841=29523. So, according to that, the total expression is 29523, but according to the formula, it's 88572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in either the step-by-step calculation or in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the first 3*(, there's a 1 + 3*(...), then inside that another 1 + 3*(...), and so on until the innermost 1 + 3. So, how many 1 + 3*(...) are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3*, we have:\n\n1+3(...\n\nThen inside that, another 1+3(...\n\nAnd this continues until the last 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3( occur? Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...\n2. Then inside that: 1+3*(...\n3. Then inside that: 1+3*(...\n4. Then inside that: 1+3*(...\n5. Then inside that: 1+3*(...\n6. Then inside that: 1+3*(...\n7. Then inside that: 1+3*(...\n8. Then inside that: 1+3*(...\n9. Then inside that: 1+3.\n\nSo, there are 8 instances of 1+3*(...), followed by the innermost 1+3. So, that would mean that the innermost layer is 1+3=4, which is Layer 1, then each outer layer adds another 1+3*(...), up to Layer 8 being 1+3*(Layer 1), and the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8). So, in this case, the total number of layers is 8, not 9. That explains the discrepancy. So, in my initial step-by-step, I considered 9 layers, but actually, there are only 8 layers inside the first 3*(...), making the total layers 8, with the outermost being 3*(Layer 8).\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nLet me redefine the layers as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nSo, in this case, the number of layers is 8, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost 1+3=4, up to Layer 8 being 9841, and then the entire expression is 3*9841=29523.\n\nNow, applying the general formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Here, n=8, so a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2=9841, which matches Layer 8. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8=3*9841=29523, which matches my step-by-step result.\n\nEarlier, I mistakenly thought there were 9 layers, leading to a_9=29524 and total expression 88572, which was incorrect. The correct number of layers inside the first 3*( is 8, so the total expression is 3*a_8=29523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{29523}\\)."

Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So that would be:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I have an expression of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, the next level out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit big, but okay. Let me go another level out. So, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let's calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that's growing really quickly. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. 3*40 is indeed 120, so adding 1 gives 121. That seems correct.\n\nMoving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWhoa, that's getting huge. Let me see how many levels there are. Each time I solve an inner expression, I move one level out. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep this goes.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which I did as 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364... Let me try to list them step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3.

Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot of steps. Let me count again. The original expression is 3 multiplied by a series of nested 1 + 3(...). Each time, I'm solving one level and then moving out. So starting from the innermost, which is step 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen step 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, after solving all nine levels, the innermost expression becomes 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then we have 3 multiplied by that.\n\nSo, the final step is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me break it down properly.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. But maybe a better way is to do it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one, and each time, the number is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern here that can be expressed with a formula instead of computing each step manually. Maybe it's a geometric series or something like that.\n\nLet me think about it. Each time, we have a term like 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is a_9, and then we multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time in the future. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B.\n\nTo find another equation, let's compute a_2.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution, a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9 / 6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for a_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then we have 3 multiplied by that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524*3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20,000 *3 =60,000.\n\n9,000*3=27,000.\n\n500*3=1,500.\n\n20*3=60.\n\n4*3=12.\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000.\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500.\n\n88,500 +60=88,560.\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, the structure is like this: starting from the innermost part, each step is 1 plus 3 times the next step. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think I need to compute each one starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me try to write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1+3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that innermost part. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level is 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next level is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that level is 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3*121 first. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, this level is 364.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, this level is 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, this level is 3280.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, this level is 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, this level is 29524.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, this level is 88573.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, the expression is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. So, the outermost expression is 265720.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, I need to compute 3*(265720). Let me calculate that. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3 times 265720 is 797160.\n\nWait a second, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when you do a lot of multiplications, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*265720. Let me compute this again:\n\n265720 * 3:\n- 200000 * 3 = 600000\n- 60000 * 3 = 180000\n- 5000 * 3 = 15000\n- 700 * 3 = 2100\n- 20 * 3 = 60\nAdding these together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but now I'm thinking, maybe there's a pattern here that I could have recognized earlier without computing each step manually. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, maybe this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we have a recursive relation here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many levels do we have? Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4. Then each layer out is a_{n} where n increases by 1 each time. So, the outermost expression before the final multiplication is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, the outermost expression before the final multiplication was 265720, which is 1 + 3*88573 = 265720. But according to this formula, a_9 is 29524, which is different. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each closing parenthesis corresponds to moving out one layer. Let's count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and each \")\" closes a layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is the first layer, then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a new layer. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the first is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(, which suggests 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost expression before the final multiplication is a_9, which according to the formula is 29524. But when I computed step by step, I ended up with 265720 before multiplying by 3. So, that suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check: if a_n is the value at the nth layer, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, a_9 would be the value after 9 layers, which is 29524. But in my step-by-step computation, I ended up with 265720 before the final multiplication, which is much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers when computing step-by-step. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 a_1 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2192 a_2 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2192 a_3 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2192 a_4 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2192 a_5 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2192 a_6 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2192 a_7 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2192 a_8 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2192 a_9 = 29524\n\nSo, according to this, a_9 is 29524. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step-by-step, I ended up with 265720 before multiplying by 3, which would give me 797160. But that contradicts the formula, which suggests that a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis means I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step computation. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nLooking back at my step-by-step:\n\nI started with (1+3)=4.\n\nThen 1+3*4=13.\n\nThen 1+3*13=40.\n\nThen 1+3*40=121.\n\nThen 1+3*121=364.\n\nThen 1+3*364=1093.\n\nThen 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nThen 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nThen 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went beyond that, going up to 265720. That suggests that I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and each \")\" closes it. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I compute a_9, I get 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 265720 before multiplying by 3, which suggests that I had more layers than I should have. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(. Starting from the left:\n\n- After the first 3(, we have (1+3(1+3(...))).\n\nEach time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(. That suggests that there are 9 layers, meaning that a_9 is the value before the final multiplication. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with a_9 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the formula. So, where did I go wrong earlier when I computed up to 265720? I think I must have miscounted the layers, adding an extra layer beyond the 9th.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers when I did the step-by-step. Let me recount the layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 a_1 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2192 a_2 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2192 a_3 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2192 a_4 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2192 a_5 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2192 a_6 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2192 a_7 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2192 a_8 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2192 a_9 = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, ending at a_9 = 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 797160 as I previously thought. I must have added an extra layer in my initial step-by-step computation, which led to the incorrect result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again.\n\nWe have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think the confusion came from miscounting the layers when I did the initial step-by-step computation, leading me to an incorrect final value. By using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I can be more confident in the result.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The expression is a nested structure with 9 layers.\n- Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n- The general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n- For n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n- The total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the value of each layer and then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Recurrence relation**: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a\u2081 = 4.\n3. **General formula**: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n4. **Compute a\u2089**: For n=9, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3), right? So, I can start by computing that and then work my way outwards. Let me write down each step as I go. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace that part with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that part becomes 13. \n\n2. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, this part becomes 40.\n\n3. Next level out, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that. 3 times 40 is 120, and adding 1 gives me 121. So, that part becomes 121.\n\n4. Moving another level out, we have 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute this. 3 times 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. So, this part becomes 364.\n\n5. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*(364). Let me figure that out. 3 times 364 is... let me do the multiplication step by step. 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 64 is 192. So, adding those together, 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, this part becomes 1093.\n\n6. Now, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that. 3 times 1000 is 3000, and 3 times 93 is 279. So, 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that part becomes 3280.\n\n7. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate that. 3 times 3000 is 9000, and 3 times 280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives me 9841. So, this part becomes 9841.\n\n8. Moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute this. 3 times 9000 is 27,000, and 3 times 841 is... let's see, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. So, adding those together: 2400 + 120 is 2520, plus 3 is 2523. So, 27,000 + 2523 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29,524. So, that part becomes 29,524.\n\n9. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*(29,524). Let me compute this. 3 times 29,524. Hmm, let me break that down. 3 times 20,000 is 60,000, 3 times 9,000 is 27,000, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 24 is 72. Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500. 88,500 + 72 is 88,572. So, 3 times 29,524 is 88,572. Adding 1 gives me 88,573. So, that part becomes 88,573.\n\n10. Now, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(88,573). Let me compute this. 3 times 88,573. Let me break it down: 3 times 80,000 is 240,000, 3 times 8,000 is 24,000, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 70 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Now, adding all those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500. 265,500 + 210 is 265,710. 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. So, 3 times 88,573 is 265,719. Adding 1 gives me 265,720. So, that part becomes 265,720.\n\n11. Finally, the outermost expression is 3 times this result. So, it's 3*(265,720). Let me compute that. 3 times 200,000 is 600,000, 3 times 65,000 is 195,000, 3 times 700 is 2,100, and 3 times 20 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 195,000 is 795,000. 795,000 + 2,100 is 797,100. 797,100 + 60 is 797,160. So, 3 times 265,720 is 797,160.\n\nWait a minute, that seems really large. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\n10. Next: (1 + 3*29,524) = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573.\n\n11. Next: (1 + 3*88,573) = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720.\n\n12. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*265,720 = 797,160.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check the multiplication steps again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFor step 10: 3*29,524. Let's compute that again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. Then, adding 1 gives 88,573.\n\nThen, step 11: 3*88,573.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n88,573 * 3:\n- 80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n- 8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 70 * 3 = 210\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n\nAdding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3*88,573 = 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives 265,720.\n\nFinally, step 12: 3*265,720.\n\nLet me compute that again.\n\n265,720 * 3:\n- 200,000 * 3 = 600,000\n- 60,000 * 3 = 180,000\n- 5,000 * 3 = 15,000\n- 700 * 3 = 2,100\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. In my initial calculation, I broke it down as 200,000, 65,000, 700, and 20. But actually, 265,720 is 200,000 + 60,000 + 5,000 + 700 + 20. So, let me correct that.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n- 200,000 * 3 = 600,000\n- 60,000 * 3 = 180,000\n- 5,000 * 3 = 15,000\n- 700 * 3 = 2,100\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n\nNow, adding them up step by step:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160\n\nSo, 3*265,720 is indeed 797,160. Therefore, the final result is 797,160.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check if I counted the number of parentheses correctly because sometimes with these problems, it's easy to miscount the levels.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds one more level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n10. Then closing parentheses start.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a new level. So, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a level. Let me count:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds one more level. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, that means there are 9 nested levels. So, when I was computing earlier, I went through 9 steps from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost 3*(result). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I ended up with 797,160, which is a 6-digit number. That seems plausible, given that each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 is compounding the value significantly. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern that could simplify the calculation.\n\nI notice that each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can express this as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built using this relation. Let's see how this plays out.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841,\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524,\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573,\n\na_11 = 1 + 3*a_10 = 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720,\n\na_12 = 1 + 3*a_11 = 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_11), not a_12. So, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to a_11 and then multiplied by 3, which gave me 797,160. But according to the recurrence, a_12 would be 797,161. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for any n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 levels of nesting, starting from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost 3*(a_9). Wait, let me clarify. Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(next term), so the first term is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, and so on, up to a_9 = 29,524, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572, but no, wait, that's not right.\n\nWait, actually, in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if we consider that the innermost is a_1 = 4, then the next level is a_2 = 13, and so on, up to a_9 = 29,524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. But wait, that's not matching with my earlier step-by-step computation where I ended up with 797,160.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\nWait, that's 9 levels. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29,524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. But wait, in my earlier step-by-step calculation, I went all the way up to a_11 = 265,720, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797,160. So, that suggests that I might have miscounted the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: each \"1+3(\" adds a new level, but the outermost expression is 3*(...), which would correspond to n=9, so a_9 = 29,524, and then 3*a_9 = 88,572. But in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to a_11 = 265,720, which would correspond to n=11, implying 11 levels. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of \"1+3(\" sections in the original problem. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new level, and the innermost is the last (1+3). Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sections:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 \"1+3(\" sections, which means 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29,524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. But wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I computed up to a_11 = 265,720, which would be n=11. So, that suggests that I might have miscounted the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the expression starts with 3*(...), and then inside, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, perhaps the number of a_n terms is one more than the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Let me think.\n\nIf there are 9 \"1+3(\" sections, that would mean there are 10 levels, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new level, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1+3), which is level 1, then each \"1+3(\" adds a new level outward. So, with 9 \"1+3(\" sections, that would mean 10 levels. Therefore, a_10 would be the innermost, and the outermost would be 3*a_10.\n\nWait, let me clarify this. Let me consider the expression as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1+3)\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nLevel n: 1 + 3*(Level n-1)\n\nSo, if there are 9 \"1+3(\" sections, that would mean that the innermost is Level 9, and the outermost is Level 10. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 10). So, let's compute Level 1 through Level 10.\n\nGiven that, let's compute each Level:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*Level 1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*Level 2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*Level 3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*Level 4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*Level 5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*Level 6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*Level 7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*Level 8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524\n\nLevel 10: 1 + 3*Level 9 = 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Level 10 = 3*88,573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier calculation where I ended up with 797,160. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me recount the number of \"1+3(\" sections in the original problem. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new level. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, that's 10 \"1+3(\" sections, but the last one is just (1+3) without another \"1+3(\" after it. So, actually, there are 9 \"1+3(\" sections, each adding a new level, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is Level 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, each \"1+3(\" adds a new level outward. So, the first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 13.\n\nThen, the next \"1+3(\" is Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, up to Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 29,524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to Level 10: 88,573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me try to map this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the expression is 3*(Level 9), where Level 9 is 1 + 3*(Level 8). So, Level 9 is 29,524, and 3*29,524 = 88,572. But in my earlier step-by-step, I had computed up to a_11 = 265,720, which would be Level 11, implying 11 levels. So, perhaps the original problem has 9 levels, meaning that the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I had 797,160. So, I must have miscounted the number of levels.\n\nWait, let's try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, each corresponding to a \"1+3(\" section. Therefore, there are 9 levels of nesting, starting from the innermost (1+3) as Level 1, up to Level 9, which is the expression inside the 9th \"1+3(\".\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9). So, let's compute Level 1 through Level 9:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*Level 1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*Level 2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*Level 3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*Level 4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*Level 5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*Level 6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*Level 7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*Level 8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Level 9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to Level 11, which would be beyond the original problem's structure. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial step-by-step by going beyond the required levels. Therefore, the correct computation should stop at Level 9"

Hmm, this seems recursive. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n...\nI think there are 9 layers here because each \"1+\" starts a new layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, there are 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost. So, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9)\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because I think I might have made a mistake in the carry-over.\n\nWait, let's do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Add the carried 1: 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6. Add the carried 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nStarting from L1 to L9:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with 9 layers.\n\nIf I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) = 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on.\n\nBut perhaps it's more complicated than necessary since we've already solved it step by step and confirmed with a formula.\n\nSo, to recap, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. \n\nAlright, moving another layer out, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So now, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. \n\nWait, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me write down the steps so far to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, so each time, it's like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, maybe if I can figure out how many layers there are, I can compute this without having to go through each step manually. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 1+3 terms inside: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me see, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each layer adds one more set of parentheses. So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), and each layer adds another, so from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, so after 10 layers, the value is 88573. But then, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Because the outermost is 3*(...). So, the total expression would be 3*88573.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me recount. When I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n2. The first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3: that's one.\n3. Then another \"1+3(\": that's two.\n4. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first opening parenthesis after that is for the first (1+3(...)). Then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) \u2014 that's one opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)): that's the second opening parenthesis.\n\nContinuing this way, each \"1+3(\" adds another opening parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, let's count:\n\n1. First ( after 3: layer 1\n2. Next ( after that: layer 2\n3. Next: layer 3\n4. Next: layer 4\n5. Next: layer 5\n6. Next: layer 6\n7. Next: layer 7\n8. Next: layer 8\n9. Next: layer 9\n10. Next: layer 10\n\nWait, that can't be right because the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 10, but then we have to compute up to layer 10 and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let me consider that each time, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if I start from the innermost and work my way out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nSo, after 10 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*88573.\n\nLet me compute 3*88573. 88,573 times 3. Let me compute this:\n\n88,573 * 3:\n\n3*3 = 9, write down 9.\n\n3*7 = 21, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 88,573 is a 5-digit number, so:\n\n88,573\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n?\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write down the 2.\n\nWait, but 88,573 is 8 8 5 7 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n   8 8 5 7 3\n\u00d7        3\n------------\n   ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write 1, carry over 2\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry over 1\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry over 2\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry over 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the 2.\n\nWait, but that would give 265,719. Let me check:\n\n88,573 \u00d7 3:\n\n80,000 \u00d7 3 = 240,000\n\n8,000 \u00d7 3 = 24,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n70 \u00d7 3 = 210\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nAdding them up:\n\n240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 88,573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Because if there are 9 layers, the result would be different. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression. Let me count again:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3: 1+3(...\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(...\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is Layer 9: (1+3).\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 9 layers, not 10. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the outermost 3*(...), the first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1.\n\nInside that, another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing until Layer 9 is the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, that would mean that the innermost is Layer 9, and then we have to compute up to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I computed up to Layer 10 as 88,573, which would be incorrect if there are only 9 layers. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the innermost was Layer 10, but now I'm seeing that there are only 9 layers, so the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in counting the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nInside that:\n\n2. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 2\n\n3. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 3\n\n4. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 4\n\n5. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 5\n\n6. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 6\n\n7. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 7\n\n8. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 8\n\n9. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 9, right? So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought there were 10 layers, I got 265,719, which seems too large.\n\nWait, so which is correct? Let me try to count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen inside that, another \"1+3(\" \u2192 Layer 2\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is (1+3). How many \"1+3(\" are there?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 4: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 5: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 6: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 7: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 8: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nLayer 9: 1+3(\u2026))\n\nBut wait, the innermost is (1+3), which doesn't have a \"1+3(\" after that. So, the number of \"1+3(\" is 9, leading to 9 layers, with the innermost being Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the computation should be up to Layer 9, giving us 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 10 layers because I was counting the innermost as Layer 1, but that seems to be incorrect. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a layer, and the innermost is Layer 1. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression, how many \"1+3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 1\n\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 2\n\n3. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 3\n\n4. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 4\n\n5. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 5\n\n6. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 6\n\n7. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 7\n\n8. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 8\n\n9. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nThen, the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 9.\n\nWait, but that would mean that there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the computation would be up to Layer 9, giving 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed up to Layer 10, I got 88,573, which led to 265,719, but that seems inconsistent with the correct number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me try to compute the layers again, this time carefully counting the number of layers.\n\nLet me start over:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me parse this as follows:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" are present after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nInside that:\n\n2. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 2\n\n3. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 3\n\n4. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 4\n\n5. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 5\n\n6. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 6\n\n7. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 7\n\n8. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 8\n\n9. 1+3(\u2026)) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nAfter Layer 9, we have (1+3), which is the innermost, so that's Layer 9. So, there are 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, the computation should proceed as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524.\n\nCalculating 3*29,524:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total: 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the innermost was Layer 1, leading to 10 layers, but that seems incorrect. Now, I'm confident that there are 9 layers, leading to 88,572 as the final result.\n\nBut let me double-check this by another method. Perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nLet me consider the general form: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as:\n\nx_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, x_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as we computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nx_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is x_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution x_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition x_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, x_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29,524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this with another approach to be absolutely sure.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each step is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the sequence is:\n\nx_1 = 4\n\nx_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nx_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nx_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nx_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nx_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nx_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nx_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nx_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nSo, x_9 = 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived earlier: x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n = 9, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nSo, 3*x_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified this sufficiently. The answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous result. After 9 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 + 3 times another similar expression. The innermost term is (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: \n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let me start by identifying how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Hmm, so there are nine layers of parentheses. That means I need to start from the innermost one and work my way out, solving each layer step by step. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nOkay, so starting from the innermost part, which is the last parentheses: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3 \\times 4)))))))$\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should handle each layer one by one. Let me number each layer from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3 \\times Layer1) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3 \\times Layer2) = (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3 \\times Layer3) = (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3 \\times Layer4) = (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3 \\times Layer5) = (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3 \\times Layer6) = (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3 \\times Layer7) = (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3 \\times Layer8) = (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me make sure I'm numbering the layers correctly. The innermost parentheses is the last one, which is the ninth layer. So, starting from the ninth layer, which is (1 + 3). Then moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(Layer1)). So that's:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3*(Layer2)):\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen,\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, so after computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is Layer9, which is 29524. But the original problem is 3 times that expression, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, does that mean I need to take Layer9 and multiply it by 3?\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. It's 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, if Layer9 is 29524, then the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I computed Layer9, I think I might have included the outermost 3 already. Let me clarify. Let me parse the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), which is Layer1: 4.\n\nThen each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*LayerN), where N is the previous layer.\n\nSo, Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought Layer9 was 29524, which is the result inside the outermost parentheses. So, yes, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nFinally, 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it out properly.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,5,7,7,7,2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, let me write it correctly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, no carryover.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check again by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer9.\n\nStarting from Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, so Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). After computing each layer step by step, the outermost expression is found to be 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Parentheses):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Multiplication by 3:**  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That makes sense because each part depends on the next one, so starting from the inside would probably be the easiest way.\n\nAlright, let me write this out more clearly so I can visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, okay, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + another similar expression). Since there are multiple layers, I'll need to compute each innermost part first and then work my way outward. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers in total because each time we add another 3(1 + ...). Let me check that. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So yes, nine layers. That means I'll need to compute from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and work my way back to the first.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step. I'll start with the innermost one.\n\n**Layer 9:** (1 + 3)\nOkay, that's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nSo, Layer 9: 4\n\n**Layer 8:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 9))\nWait, let me make sure I understand. Layer 8 is the next one out, so it's 3 times (1 + 3 times Layer 9). So, substituting Layer 9's value:\n\n3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, no, hold on. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. Layer 8 is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by Layer 9). So, it's 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 9)). Since Layer 9 is 4, then:\n\n3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 8 is 39.\n\n**Layer 7:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 8))\nSo, substituting Layer 8's value of 39:\n\n3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354\n\nWait, that seems big, but let's check:\n\n3*39 is 117, plus 1 is 118, times 3 is 354. Yes, correct.\n\n**Layer 6:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 7))\nLayer 7 is 354, so:\n\n3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189\n\nHmm, that's a big number, but let's verify:\n\n3*354 is 1062, plus 1 is 1063, times 3 is 3189. Correct.\n\n**Layer 5:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 6))\nLayer 6 is 3189, so:\n\n3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704\n\nWait, 3*3189 is 9567, plus 1 is 9568, times 3 is 28704. That seems right.\n\n**Layer 4:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 5))\nLayer 5 is 28704, so:\n\n3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339\n\nLet me compute that again. 3*28704 is 86,112. Plus 1 is 86,113. Multiply by 3: 86,113 * 3. Let's compute 80,000*3=240,000, 6,000*3=18,000, 113*3=339. So 240,000 + 18,000 = 258,000, plus 339 is 258,339. Correct.\n\n**Layer 3:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 4))\nLayer 4 is 258,339, so:\n\n3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018\n\nCompute that: 700,000*3=2,100,000; 75,000*3=225,000; 18*3=54. So 2,100,000 + 225,000 = 2,325,000; plus 54 is 2,325,054. Wait, but 775,018 * 3: Let me check.\n\n700,000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n70,000 * 3 = 210,000\n5,000 * 3 = 15,000\n18 * 3 = 54\n\nSo adding those together: 2,100,000 + 210,000 = 2,310,000; plus 15,000 is 2,325,000; plus 54 is 2,325,054. Correct.\n\n**Layer 2:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 3))\nLayer 3 is 2,325,054, so:\n\n3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163\n\nCompute that: 6,000,000 * 3 = 18,000,000; 975,000 * 3 = 2,925,000; 163 * 3 = 489.\n\nSo 18,000,000 + 2,925,000 = 20,925,000; plus 489 is 20,925,489.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\n3*2,325,054 is 6,975,162. Plus 1 is 6,975,163. Multiply by 3:\n\n6,975,163 * 3: 6,000,000*3=18,000,000; 975,000*3=2,925,000; 163*3=489. So total is 18,000,000 + 2,925,000 = 20,925,000; plus 489 is 20,925,489. Correct.\n\n**Layer 1:** 3(1 + 3(Layer 2))\nLayer 2 is 20,925,489, so:\n\n3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468\n\nCompute that: 60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000; 2,776,468 * 3 = let's compute 2,000,000*3=6,000,000; 776,468*3=2,329,404.\n\nSo 6,000,000 + 2,329,404 = 8,329,404.\n\nSo total is 180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, let me check 62,776,468 * 3:\n\n62,776,468 * 3: 60,000,000*3=180,000,000; 2,776,468*3=8,329,404. So total is 180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out correctly. So I think I can confidently say that the final answer is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions. So, maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way out, simplifying each step as I go. Let me try that.\n\nAlright, the innermost part is $1+3$. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that. So, 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. Okay, so now that layer simplifies to 13. \n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(13)$. Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is $1 + 3(40)$. Let's compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 plus 120 is 121. So, that's 121. \n\nNext, moving out another layer, we have $1 + 3(121)$. Calculating that, 3 times 121 is 363, and 1 plus 363 is 364. So, that's 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, the expression is $1 + 3(364)$. Let me do that: 3 times 364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. So, that's 1093. \n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(1093)$. Calculating that, 3 times 1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. So, that's 3280. \n\nNext layer out, we have $1 + 3(3280)$. Let's compute that: 3 times 3280 is 9840, and 1 plus 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. \n\nMoving out another layer, the expression is $1 + 3(9841)$. Calculating that, 3 times 9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. So, that's 29524. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is $3(29524)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 29524 is... hmm, let me break that down. 29524 times 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3. \n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 is 60000. Then, 9000 * 3 is 27000. 500 * 3 is 1500. 20 * 3 is 60, and 4 * 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000. 87000 + 1500 is 88500. 88500 + 60 is 88560. 88560 + 12 is 88572. So, 3 times 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do mental math, I might slip up. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a mistake along the way:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems to follow correctly, so I think I did it right. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result), which is a recursive pattern. Maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence? Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and then a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting with 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time, it's 3(1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers? Let me check:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(...)), and inside each, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on. Let's count the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts.\n\nLooking at the LaTeX code, it's:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(...)), then each subsequent (1+3(...) is another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost 1+3, then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers?\n\nLet me parse it:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then moving out:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, but the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning there are 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is the 9th layer. So, using the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier counting, when I started from the innermost as a_1, each layer out increments n by 1. So, if there are 9 layers, then n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524, which is the value inside the outermost 3(...). Then, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. That's reassuring.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can see that each layer is a geometric progression, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear function. So, starting from the innermost term, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I denote the innermost term as t1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then t2 = 1 + 3*t1 = 1 + 12 = 13, t3 = 1 + 3*t2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, up to t9, which is 29524. Then, the outermost term is 3*t9 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each step manually or use the formula for the recursive sequence, I end up with the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes, let me verify a couple of the intermediate steps:\n\n- t1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n- t9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the intermediate steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, the sequence grows exponentially. The formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, perfectly captures this growth.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which again matches. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how recognizing patterns and using recursive formulas can simplify what initially looks like a complicated expression. Instead of computing each layer step by step manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone, understanding the underlying structure allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem step by step, recognizing the recursive pattern, and applying the appropriate formula, I arrived at the solution of 88572. It's always satisfying when different methods converge to the same answer, confirming its correctness.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, the expression is built like this: starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer wraps another (1 + 3*(previous expression)). Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think I need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step, labeling each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3*(result of layer 1)\n3. 1+3*(result of layer 2)\n4. 1+3*(result of layer 3)\n5. 1+3*(result of layer 4)\n6. 1+3*(result of layer 5)\n7. 1+3*(result of layer 6)\n8. 1+3*(result of layer 7)\n9. 1+3*(result of layer 8)\n10. The entire expression is 3*(result of layer 9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Hmm, that might mean I need to compute 9 layers, each time plugging the result into the next layer. Let me confirm by counting the opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see: starting from the first (1+3, that's one, then each subsequent (1+3 adds another. So from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers, right? Because the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost, that's 1, and then each time we go out, it's another layer, so total of 9 layers. So, I need to compute each layer from 1 to 9, starting with the innermost.\n\nLet me create a table to keep track of each layer's result. Let's denote Layer 1 as the innermost (1+3), and Layer 9 as the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I should do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly, because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which could save time and reduce the chance of error.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this problem, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the result of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). Using a step-by-step approach or a closed-form formula, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). That's straightforward. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so now we have 40. Let me see how many times this pattern repeats. Looking back at the original problem, I can count the number of opening parentheses before the last closing one. Let me count: starting from the innermost, each set adds another layer. I think there are nine sets of parentheses in total. Wait, let me check again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nSo, actually, the expression is nested nine times. That means I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try to list each step clearly.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1 + 3. Hmm, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of \"1 +\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me try to parse it:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3*(...), there's a 1 + 3*(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the ninth time, which is (1 + 3). So, that's nine layers in total. Therefore, I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out.\n\nWait, but when I did the steps before, I got up to 29524, but let me check if that's correct. Let me list each step with their corresponding layer.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that:\n\nTotal expression: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nCalculating 3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n\nNext, 3 * 500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check the multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me go back and check my earlier steps because 88572 seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLet me recount each layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost multiplication is only by 3, not by 3 at each layer. So, actually, the way I computed it is correct: the innermost layers evaluate to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let me define the terms recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n... and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general form of the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, which is our case, the value is:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because 3^{10} is 59049, right? Yes, because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 is 59048/2, which is 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, but it's not a geometric series per se. However, using the formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is neat.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, as we saw.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, and it confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\n- The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer.\n- There are nine such layers, starting from (1+3) up to the ninth layer.\n- Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n- For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n- The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can solve it efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next term)}\\), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the final result by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try to write it out more clearly to visualize what's going on. Starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we have another 1+3(...) until we get to the outermost one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. Hmm, let's see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections. There's one at the very end, then another, and so on. Let me see: each time I have a 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 1+3. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of 3s after each 1+. Let's see: Each time it's 1+3(...), so the number of layers is 9, because each time it's 1+3(...), and there are 9 such layers before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, let me check again. The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))). So, each time, it's 1+3*(...), starting from the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. Each opening parenthesis adds a new layer, so let's see:\n\n1. Starting with the innermost: (1+3)\n2. Then, the next layer is (1+3*(...))\n3. So, each time, we have a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. The expression is:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. Let's see:\n\n- The first (1+3) is the innermost.\n- Then, the next is (1+3*(...)), so that's one layer.\n- Then another (1+3*(...)), that's two layers.\n- Continuing this way, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then the next layer is (1+3*(1+3)), then (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))), and so on. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Wait, perhaps a better way is to see that each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1+...). Let me see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1+...). Let me count how many 3s are after the 1+ signs. Wait, maybe it's better to just count the number of times we have 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3*(1+3))\n3. Then: (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Each time, we have a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: (1+3*(layer1)). Layer3: (1+3*(layer2)), and so on. How many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer1.\n\nThen, each time we have another 1+3*(...), so let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- Layer1: (1+3)\n- Layer2: (1+3*(Layer1))\n- Layer3: (1+3*(Layer2))\n- Layer4: (1+3*(Layer3))\n- Layer5: (1+3*(Layer4))\n- Layer6: (1+3*(Layer5))\n- Layer7: (1+3*(Layer6))\n- Layer8: (1+3*(Layer7))\n- Layer9: (1+3*(Layer8))\n- Finally, the outermost 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. Because starting from Layer1, each time we add another layer, up to Layer9, and then multiplied by 3. So, total of 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, we need to compute starting from Layer1 and moving outward to Layer9, then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me create a table to keep track of each layer's value.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524.\n\nFirst, let's compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n---------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because it's easy to make an arithmetic error in such a long chain.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes, when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me make sure that I counted correctly.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), how many times does the pattern 1+3*(...) repeat? Let's see:\n\nEach time, after the first (1+3), we have another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the innermost, then each layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 1+3 is 8, because each time we have another (1+3*(...)). Let me count:\n\n- After the first 1+3, we have 8 more layers, each starting with 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 1+3.\n\nEach 1+3*(...) introduces a new opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then, each time we have another (1+3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that each time you have a 1+3*(...), which is one layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s inside the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEach time, we have another 3 inside. So, the number of layers is 9, because each layer adds another 3.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many times does 3 appear? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s inside the expression after the initial 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each layer adds one more 3. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a 3*(...), and starting from the innermost, there are 9 such layers before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, and that led me to the correct result. So, perhaps that's accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I applied the formula correctly.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is correct.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, and the formula for a_n is a geometric series.\n\nBut since I already got the same answer through two different methods, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize that the expression is a nested sequence of similar terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. Decide to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n3. Compute each layer's value and keep track of the results.\n\n4. After computing all layers, multiply the outermost layer's result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n5. Double-check the result using a different method, solving the recurrence relation, to ensure accuracy.\n\nBoth approaches led me to the same final value, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's about it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the recurrence relation method, we derive a formula for the nth layer and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification using recurrence relation**: The nth layer value is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Thus, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next expression. Let me see, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until I get to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression and then move outward step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost part: 1 + 3.\n\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1), which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*4.\n\nFirst, do the multiplication: 3*4 = 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the result of the second layer is 13.\n\nStep 3: Now, moving one more layer out, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(result from step 2), which is 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, the third layer gives us 40.\n\nStep 4: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCalculate 3*40: 120. Then, add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFourth layer result: 121.\n\nStep 5: Now, moving outward again: 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute 3*121: Let's see, 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nFifth layer result: 364.\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculate 3*364: Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSixth layer result: 1093.\n\nStep 7: Moving outward: 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSeventh layer result: 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculate 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nEighth layer result: 9841.\n\nStep 9: Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNinth layer result: 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from the ninth layer. So, the outermost operation is 3*(29524).\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me break this down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nThere's no more digits, but we have a carry over 0, so we're done.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me verify:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext, 5 \u00d7 3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext, 9 \u00d7 3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d7 3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps because the numbers got quite large. Maybe I should verify each step to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\n10. 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, all steps check out. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure of the expression to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, each time you go a layer deeper, you have another (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is the 9th layer, right?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nFrom the start, after the first 3, the first (1 + 3( starts the first layer. Then each subsequent (1 + 3( is another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the ninth layer. So, when I started from the innermost, that was the ninth layer, so when I computed up to the ninth layer, that was correct. So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer's result, which is 29,524, giving 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Each time I see a (1 + 3(, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3( adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1 + 3( appears, which is 9 times. So, the innermost is the ninth layer, and the outermost is the first layer. Therefore, when I computed up to the ninth layer, I correctly reached the innermost part, and then each step moving outward correctly computed each layer, ending with the outermost 3 multiplied by the ninth layer's result.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. Each step was computed accurately, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to represent the expression in a more general form. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost expression, and each subsequent a_n is built by a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in this case, since we're starting from the innermost, a_1 would be 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 would be 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches my earlier steps. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which would be 1 + 3*a_8, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant.\n\nWait, let me try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the ninth layer, n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I obtained earlier for the ninth layer.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see.\n\nFrom the recurrence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we found. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nThis method also confirms that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute the expression using another approach, perhaps by expanding each layer step by step, though that might be time-consuming, but given that I've already done it once, maybe I can recount the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\n10. 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYep, same numbers each time. So, I think it's solid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a table to list each step clearly.\n\nLet me create a table where each row represents a layer, starting from the innermost as layer 1 up to layer 9, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nLayer | Expression | Value\n-----|------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3      | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4    | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13   | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40   | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121  | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364  | 1,093\n7    | 1 + 3*1,093| 3,280\n8    | 1 + 3*3,280| 9,841\n9    | 1 + 3*9,841| 29,524\n10   | 3*29,524   | 88,572\n\nThis table clearly shows each step and the corresponding value. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the final value after layer 10 is 88,572.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to verify this. The answer seems consistent across different methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and direct expansion. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n10. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the final answer should be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each nested within the previous one. So starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer outward. So 9 layers in total, as I computed. So the result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing step by step seems manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote each term as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So actually, if I let b_n = 3*(1 + b_{n-1}), with b_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no, that's not correct because the innermost layer is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which would be b_2 = 15. So perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, maybe if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 3*a_n. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but let me think.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So if I define a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nGiven that, starting from a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4, then:\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I still get 36084 as the final result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K = 3 + 3K => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1 using the general solution:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 3/2 = (8/2 + 3/2) = 11/2\n\nThus, C = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2.\n\nWe can factor out 1/6:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nWait, let's check this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 \u00f7 6\n\n6 goes into 21 three times (3*6=18), remainder 3.\n\nBring down 6: 36. 6 goes into 36 six times, remainder 0.\n\nBring down 5: 05. 6 goes into 5 zero times, but we can write it as 0 with remainder 5.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 216,504 \u00f7 6 step by step:\n\n6 into 2 is 0, but 6 into 21 is 3 (3*6=18), remainder 3.\n\nBring down 6: 36. 6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0.\n\nBring down 5: 05. 6 into 5 is 0, but we can consider it as 50 now (since next digit is 0).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 216,504 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 into 2 is 0, but 6 into 21 is 3, as before.\n\n3*6=18, subtract from 21: 3.\n\nBring down 6: 36.\n\n6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0.\n\nBring down 5: 05.\n\n6 into 5 is 0, but we can write it as 50 (since the next digit is 0).\n\n6 into 50 is 8 (8*6=48), remainder 2.\n\nBring down 0: 20.\n\n6 into 20 is 3 (3*6=18), remainder 2.\n\nBring down 4: 24.\n\n6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0.\n\nSo putting it all together: 3 (from 21), then 6 (from 36), then 0 (from 5), then 8 (from 50), 3 (from 20), and 4 (from 24). So the result is 36,084.\n\nWait, that's 36,084. So, 216,504 \u00f7 6 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with n=4 using the formula:\n\na_4 = (11*3^4 - 9)/6 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works, and thus, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if there's a pattern in the numbers we got:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 15\n\nLayer 3: 48\n\nLayer 4: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 6: 1335\n\nLayer 7: 4008\n\nLayer 8: 12027\n\nLayer 9: 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3*(1). Wait, no, actually, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, each term is 3 more than 3 times the previous term.\n\nWait, but in any case, the step-by-step computation seems solid, and the formula also gives the same result, so I'm confident that 36,084 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from (1 + 3) = 4. By computing each layer step by step, and verifying with a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result each time. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( 3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( 3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( 3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( 3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( 3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( 3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( 3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027 \\)\n9. Outermost layer: \\( 3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

So, maybe if I start solving from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be manageable. Let me count the number of innermost parentheses to see where to start. \n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems like a good starting point. Let me compute that first:\n\nInnermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next part is:\n\n1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so the next level up becomes 13. Now, moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So:\n\n1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that:\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so now we're at 40. Continuing this pattern, the next level would be:\n\n1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that:\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nOkay, so now we're at 121. Next level out:\n\n1 + 3*(121). Let's see:\n\n3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nContinuing outward, next expression is:\n\n1 + 3*(364). Calculating that:\n\n3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nAlright, moving out another layer, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute this:\n\n3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n1 + 3*(3280). Let's calculate:\n\n3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is:\n\n1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that:\n\n3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute this:\n\n3*29524 = 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 times 3. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5*3 = 15, carryover 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is:\n\n1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute that:\n\n3*88573. Let me calculate this:\n\nFirst, 80000 * 3 = 240000.\nThen, 8000 * 3 = 24000.\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n70 * 3 = 210.\n3 * 3 = 9.\nAdding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719.\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is:\n\n1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute that:\n\n3*265720. Let me break it down:\n\n200000 * 3 = 600000.\n60000 * 3 = 180000.\n5000 * 3 = 15000.\n700 * 3 = 2100.\n20 * 3 = 60.\nAdding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160.\n\nSo, 3*265720 = 797160. Adding 1 gives 797161.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because 265720 * 3:\n\n200000 * 3 = 600000\n60000 * 3 = 180000\n5000 * 3 = 15000\n700 * 3 = 2100\n20 * 3 = 60\nNow, adding all these: 600000 + 180000 = 780000\n780000 + 15000 = 795000\n795000 + 2100 = 797100\n797100 + 60 = 797160\nYes, that's correct. So, 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(797161). Let's compute that:\n\n3*797161. Let me break it down:\n\n700000 * 3 = 2,100,000\n90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n7,000 * 3 = 21,000\n100 * 3 = 300\n60 * 3 = 180\n1 * 3 = 3\nAdding them up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161 = 2,391,483. Adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is:\n\n1 + 3*(2,391,484). Let's compute that:\n\n3*2,391,484. Let me calculate this step by step:\n\n2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n391,000 * 3 = 1,173,000\n484 * 3 = 1,452\nNow, adding these together:\n\n6,000,000 + 1,173,000 = 7,173,000\n7,173,000 + 1,452 = 7,174,452\n\nSo, 3*2,391,484 = 7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nNow, finally, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, the outermost part is:\n\n3*(7,174,453). Let me compute that:\n\n7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n174,000 * 3 = 522,000\n453 * 3 = 1,359\nAdding them up:\n\n21,000,000 + 522,000 = 21,522,000\n21,522,000 + 1,359 = 21,523,359\n\nWait, let me double-check that:\n\n7,174,453 * 3:\n\n7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n174,000 * 3 = 522,000\n453 * 3 = 1,359\nAdding them:\n\n21,000,000 + 522,000 = 21,522,000\n21,522,000 + 1,359 = 21,523,359\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is 21,523,359.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication or addition. Let me recount the steps to ensure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n13. 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484\n14. 1 + 3*2391484 = 7174453\n15. 3*7174453 = 21523359\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had 7,174,453 as the result before the final multiplication, which when multiplied by 3 gives 21,523,359. But in the recount, I have 2391484 as step 13, then step 14 is 7174453, and step 15 is 21,523,359. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from 1. So, each step is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nThis seems like a geometric series or a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n-2*a_p = 1\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. When n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1 into a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nSo, the general term is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of times the expression repeats. Starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1+3*...). So, the innermost is the first layer, and the outermost is the 9th layer. Wait, but when I started solving, I had 14 steps, which seems contradictory. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nEach time, it's another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, n=9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step calculation, I had 14 layers, which suggests that perhaps I miscounted. Wait, perhaps the initial expression has 9 layers, so n=9. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(... occurs:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(layer1)) \u2192 layer2\n3. (1 + 3*(layer2)) \u2192 layer3\n...\nContinuing until layer9.\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, the value at layer9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step calculation, when I reached layer9, I had 29524 as the result. Then, moving out, I had 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, which would be layer10, but in the problem, the expression only has 9 layers, so perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1 + 3*(... occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nEach layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, meaning that the innermost is layer1, and the outermost is layer9.\n\nThus, the value at layer9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as computed above.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step approach, I went beyond layer9, which might have led to confusion. So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute up to layer9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, once we compute layer9, which is a_9 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, that doesn't align with my initial step-by-step calculation where I went further out.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me visualize the structure:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial step-by-step where I went up to 21,523,359. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the layers. The problem is that the expression is 3*(layer9), so after computing layer9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, I went beyond layer9, which was incorrect. So, the correct approach is to compute up to layer9 and then multiply by 3, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because earlier when I computed up to 7,174,453 and then multiplied by 3, I got 21,523,359, which seems way too large. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). Thus, the innermost is layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 21,523,359. I must have miscounted the layers earlier, thinking there were more layers than there actually are.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer1.\n\nEach subsequent (1 + 3*(...)) adds a layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is 3*(layer9).\n\nThus, the correct computation is:\n\nlayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nlayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nlayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nlayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nlayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nlayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nlayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nlayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nlayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was counting more layers than there actually are, leading to an incorrect final result. The correct approach is to compute up to layer9 and then multiply by 3, resulting in 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly applying the operation 1 + 3*(previous result). By recognizing the pattern and using a formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The sequence follows a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form formula.\n\n3. **General Term Formula**: The nth term of the sequence is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Layers**: The expression has 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\n5. **Compute the 9th Term**: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that result, right? Wait, no. Let me check: the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times (1 + 3), but wait, is that correct? Wait, no, because each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So maybe I should start by computing the innermost expression, then substitute it into the next one, and so on. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me label each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, looking again, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So maybe it's better to work from the inside out. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses and then work my way outward.\n\nSo, starting with Layer 1: (1 + 3). That's 4. Then, Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1) + 1, but wait, no, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the inner layer. So perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it out step by step. Let me try that. Let me define each level of the expression as a separate variable to make it clearer.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Let me count. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So perhaps my Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then Layer 2 is the next one, up to Layer 9 being the one before the outermost 3. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, according to my calculations above, Layer 9 is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6. So, 29524*3 is 88572. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my steps again because that's a lot of layers, and I might have made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but let me check if I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, counting from the innermost, there are 9 layers before the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me try an alternative approach. Perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, so perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same answer, which confirms that 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentials. Let me confirm 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. Then, 3^11 is 59049*3=177147. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so expanding it, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on. So, in the limit, if n approaches infinity, a_n would approach a certain value, but in this case, n is finite, so it's just a finite expansion.\n\nBut since we've already computed it step by step and verified with the closed-form formula, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3)=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, layer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's consistent.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

    "text": " That sounds like a plan.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's another layer. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then that's inside another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count each opening parenthesis: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are nine layers here. That means I'll have to compute from the innermost one, which is the ninth layer, and work my way out to the first layer.\n\nLet me write down each layer so I can keep track. Let's label them from innermost (layer 9) to outermost (layer 1). So layer 9 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then layer 8 is 1 + 3*(layer9), layer7 is 1 + 3*(layer8), and so on, up to layer1, which is 3*(layer2). Hmm, actually, wait a second. The entire expression is 3*(...), so layer1 is 3*(layer2). So, I think my layers are as follows:\n\nLayer1: 3*(layer2)\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(layer3)\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(layer4)\n...\nLayer9: 1 + 3\n\nSo, starting from layer9, which is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving up to layer8: it's 1 + 3*(layer9). Since layer9 is 4, let's substitute that in.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, that gives me 13 for layer8. Next, moving up to layer7: 1 + 3*(layer8). Substituting 13 in there.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 40. Okay, moving on to layer6: 1 + 3*(layer7). So 1 + 3*40.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWow, that's getting big quickly. Let's see layer5: 1 + 3*(layer6). So 1 + 3*121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWhoa, 364. Okay, layer4: 1 + 3*(layer5). So 1 + 3*364.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 1093. That's a pretty large number. Let's proceed to layer3: 1 + 3*(layer4). So 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWow, 3280. Okay, moving up to layer2: 1 + 3*(layer3). So 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, that's 9841. Now, finally, layer1 is 3*(layer2). So 3*9841.\n\nLayer1: 3 * 9841 = ?\n\nHmm, let's compute that. 9841 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n40 * 3 = 120\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, layer1 is 29,523.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer1: 3*9841 = 29,523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all the layers check out. So, the final result is 29,523.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can help simplify the calculation. Let me see if this expression is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Wait, that actually sounds like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_9 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, and so on. So, in general, a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1} for k from 2 to 9, and a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, that might not be the standard geometric series, but maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can express this as a recurrence and find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nLet me write out the terms:\n\na_9 = 4\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_1 = 3*a_2 = 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nWait, so that's exactly what I did before, just written as a recurrence. So, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, this is a linear recurrence, but it's written in terms of a_{k+1}, so it's a bit different. Let me try to reverse it.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence going from a_1 to a_9 instead. So, starting from a_1 = 3*(a_2), and a_2 = 1 + 3*a_3, and so on, until a_9 = 1 + 3*1. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to model it as a_1 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, finally, 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, perhaps the only way is to compute each layer step by step because it's a linear recurrence with a non-constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model it as a sum. Let me think.\n\nEach time, we have a term like 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's going to be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with each term multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, actually, if I write out the expansion, it's going to be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is nested inside the previous one. Let me try expanding the entire expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer1: 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, actually, if I think of it as a recurrence, it's a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nTo solve this recurrence, maybe I can express a_k in terms of a_{k+1} and so on, until I reach a_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the general solution for such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_k = c + r*a_{k+1}, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is a_{k+1} = (a_k - c)/r. So, in this case, a_{k+1} = (a_k - 1)/3.\n\nSo, starting from a_9 = 4, we can compute a_8 = (a_9 - 1)/3 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1, but wait, that's not matching our earlier result. Wait, that can't be right because earlier we had a_8 = 13.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the direction. Let me see. The recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, so to express a_{k+1} in terms of a_k, we can rearrange: a_{k+1} = (a_k - 1)/3.\n\nSo, starting from a_9 = 4, then a_8 = (a_9 - 1)/3 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1, but that contradicts our earlier computation where a_8 was 13. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the direction. Let me clarify.\n\nIf a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, then a_{k+1} = (a_k - 1)/3.\n\nBut in our case, we have a_9 = 4, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 13, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 40, etc. So, when moving from a_k to a_{k-1}, it's a_{k-1} = 1 + 3*a_k.\n\nTherefore, if I want to express a_{k} in terms of a_{k+1}, it's a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}.\n\nSo, if I have a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, then a_{k} - 1 = 3*a_{k+1}, so a_{k+1} = (a_k - 1)/3.\n\nBut since we know a_9 = 4, we can compute a_8 = (a_9 - 1)/3 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1, but that's not correct because earlier we had a_8 = 13.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps I should model the recurrence as a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, with a_9 = 4. So, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc., which is what we did earlier.\n\nSo, if I want to express this as a general formula, maybe I can write it as a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k+1}, which can be rewritten as a_{k+1} = (a_k - 1)/3.\n\nBut since we're moving from a_9 to a_1, it's a bit tricky. Let me try to write the terms in terms of a_9.\n\nStarting from a_9 = 4,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841,\n\na_1 = 3*a_2 = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nSo, each term is built upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except for the last term, which is just 3 times the previous term.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of this as a sum, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me try to write out the expression without parentheses to see the structure.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nThen, 3*(9841) = 29,523\n\nSo, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result), except for the last step, which is just 3*(result).\n\nHmm, so if I denote each step as S_k, where S_1 is the innermost, then S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4,\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 13,\n\nS_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 40,\n\nand so on, up to S_9 = 1 + 3*S_8 = 9841,\n\nand finally, the total expression is 3*S_9 = 29,523.\n\nWait, so S_9 is 9841, which is the result before multiplying by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, in general, each S_k = 1 + 3*S_{k+1}, with S_9 = 4.\n\nWait, that's similar to the recurrence relation I was trying earlier.\n\nBut perhaps I can model this as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with each term also adding 1.\n\nWait, let me think about it.\n\nIf I consider S_1 = 1 + 3*S_2,\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*S_3,\n\n...\n\nS_8 = 1 + 3*S_9,\n\nS_9 = 4.\n\nSo, if I substitute each S_k into the previous equation, I can write S_1 in terms of S_2, which is in terms of S_3, and so on, until S_9.\n\nSo, S_1 = 1 + 3*S_2\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S_3)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*S_3\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*S_4)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*S_4\n\nContinuing this way, each time expanding the terms, I end up with:\n\nS_1 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8*S_9\n\nSince S_9 = 4, we can write:\n\nS_1 = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8) + 3^9*S_9\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nYes, because each expansion adds another power of 3, and the last term is 3^8*S_9.\n\nSo, S_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*S_9\n\nBut S_9 is 4, so:\n\nS_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*4\n\nThe sum sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, first term 1, and 9 terms.\n\nThe formula for the sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nSo, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19,683, right? Let me confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\nYes, so 3^9 is 19,683.\n\nSo, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841\n\nSo, S_1 = 9,841 + 3^9*4 = 9,841 + 19,683*4\n\nWait, 19,683*4 is 78,732\n\nSo, S_1 = 9,841 + 78,732 = 88,573\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed S_1, which is layer1, I got 29,523. But according to this, S_1 is 88,573. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, no, actually, in my initial computation, S_1 was the outermost layer, which is 3*(layer2) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut in this current approach, I'm considering S_1 as the innermost layer, which is 4, and expanding outward. So, perhaps I confused the notation.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIn the initial computation, I labeled layer9 as the innermost, which is 4, and layer1 as the outermost, which is 29,523.\n\nIn this current approach, I'm defining S_1 as the innermost, which is 4, and S_9 as the outermost before multiplying by 3. Wait, no, actually, S_1 would be the innermost, and S_9 would be the outermost, which is 9841, and then the total expression is 3*S_9 = 29,523.\n\nSo, in this case, S_1 = 4, S_2 = 13, S_3 = 40, ..., S_9 = 9841.\n\nSo, when I expressed S_1 in terms of the sum, I think I messed up the indices.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nGiven that S_1 = 1 + 3*S_2,\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*S_3,\n\n...\n\nS_8 = 1 + 3*S_9,\n\nS_9 = 4.\n\nSo, if I substitute each equation into the previous one, I get:\n\nS_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S_3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*S_3\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*S_4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*S_4\n\nContinuing this substitution, eventually, S_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*S_9\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, S_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*S_9\n\nWe already calculated sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = 9,841\n\nAnd S_9 = 4\n\nSo, S_1 = 9,841 + 3^9*4 = 9,841 + 19,683*4\n\nCompute 19,683*4:\n\n19,683 * 4:\n\n10,000 * 4 = 40,000\n\n9,000 * 4 = 36,000\n\n600 * 4 = 2,400\n\n80 * 4 = 320\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let's compute 19,683 * 4:\n\n19,683 * 4:\n\n10,000 * 4 = 40,000\n\n9,000 * 4 = 36,000\n\n600 * 4 = 2,400\n\n80 * 4 = 320\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, but 19,683 is 10,000 + 9,000 + 600 + 80 + 3.\n\nSo, 10,000*4 = 40,000\n\n9,000*4 = 36,000\n\n600*4 = 2,400\n\n80*4 = 320\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n40,000 + 36,000 = 76,000\n\n76,000 + 2,400 = 78,400\n\n78,400 + 320 = 78,720\n\n78,720 + 12 = 78,732\n\nSo, 19,683*4 = 78,732\n\nTherefore, S_1 = 9,841 + 78,732 = 88,573\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed layer1, which is S_1, I got 29,523. But according to this, S_1 is 88,573. That doesn't match. So, I must have misapplied the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps in this approach, S_1 is not the same as layer1. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the initial computation, layer1 was the outermost layer, which is 3*(layer2) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut in this current approach, S_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, and S_9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3, which is 9841.\n\nSo, in this notation, the total expression is 3*S_9 = 3*9841 = 29,523, which matches the initial computation.\n\nBut when I expressed S_1 in terms of the sum, I got S_1 = 88,573, which is inconsistent because S_1 is supposed to be 4. So, I must have made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, no, actually, S_1 is 4, S_2 is 13, ..., S_9 is 9841.\n\nBut when I expressed S_1 in terms of the sum, I got S_1 = 88,573, which is not correct because S_1 is 4. So, my approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the indices. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have S_1 = 1 + 3*S_2,\n\nS_2 = 1 + 3*S_3,\n\n...\n\nS_9 = 1 + 3*S_{10}, but S_{10} doesn't exist; instead, S_9 = 4.\n\nWait, so actually, S_9 = 4, which is our base case.\n\nSo, working backward, S_8 = 1 + 3*S_9 = 1 + 12 = 13,\n\nS_7 = 1 + 3*S_8 = 1 + 39 = 40,\n\nand so on.\n\nSo, in this case, S_1 is the innermost, which is 4, and S_9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because S_9 is 4, which is the innermost. So, perhaps I should index it differently.\n\nLet me try redefining the layers as follows:\n\nLet me define L_1 as the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4,\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13,\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40,\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 9841,\n\nand the total expression is 3*L_9 = 29,523.\n\nSo, in this case, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, ..., L_9 = 9841.\n\nSo, if I want to express L_1 in terms of L_9, it's L_1 = 1 + 3*L_2,\n\nBut L_2 = 1 + 3*L_3,\n\nAnd so on, until L_9 = 1 + 3*L_{10}, but L_{10} doesn't exist; instead, L_9 is the innermost expression, which is 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, L_1 is the innermost, L_9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4,\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 13,\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 40,\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 9841,\n\nTotal expression = 3*L_9 = 29,523.\n\nSo, in this case, L_1 is the innermost, and L_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication.\n\nTherefore, if I want to express L_1 in terms of L_9, I can write:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_3)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_3\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L_4)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_4\n\nContinuing this way, we get:\n\nL_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*L_9\n\nBut L_9 = 4, so:\n\nL_1 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*4\n\nAs before, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9,841\n\nAnd 3^9*4 = 19,683*4 = 78,732\n\nSo, L_1 = 9,841 + 78,732 = 88,573\n\nWait, but L_1 is supposed to be 4, not 88,573. That doesn't make sense. So, clearly, my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, I think the confusion arises because I'm trying to express L_1 in terms of L_9, but in reality, L_1 is the innermost, and L_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication. So, perhaps I should instead express L_9 in terms of L_1.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nWe have L_1 = 4,\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 13,\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 40,\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nBut L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7,\n\nAnd so on, down to L_1.\n\nSo, to express L_9 in terms of L_1, we can write:\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_7)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_7\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L_6)\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_6\n\nContinuing this substitution, we get:\n\nL_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*L_1\n\nBut L_1 = 4,\n\nSo, L_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*4\n\nAs before, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = 9,841,\n\nAnd 3^9*4 = 78,732,\n\nSo, L_9 = 9,841 + 78,732 = 88,573\n\nBut wait, earlier, L_9 was computed as 9841, which is not equal to 88,573. So, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, no, actually, L_9 is 9841, which is much less than 88,573. So, my formula must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.\n\nWait, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k is (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3^9*L_1 = 19,683*4 = 78,732.\n\nSo, L_9 = 9,841 + 78,732 = 88,573\n\nBut according to the initial computation, L_9 is 9841, which is way less than 88,573.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that L_9 is expressed in terms of L_1, but in reality, L_1 is the innermost, and L_9 is built upon L_1 through the recurrence.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the general form of such a recurrence.\n\nSuppose we have a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a base case a_9 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by unfolding it.\n\nStarting from a_9 = 4,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 12 = 13,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 39 = 40,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 120 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 363 = 364,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3279 = 3280,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 9840 = 9841,\n\na_1 = 3*a_2 = 29,523.\n\nSo, each term is built upon the previous one, and the recurrence is correctly followed.\n\nBut when I tried to express a_1 in terms of a_9, I got a wrong result. So, perhaps my earlier approach was flawed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series with a twist.\n\nLet me think: each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote the total expression as T, then T = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + "

    "text": " That usually seems to be the best approach with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better. Starting from the inside:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. Since each subsequent expression is similar, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. That makes sense because each layer depends on the result of the inner layer.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The very innermost is (1+3).\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3 times that result.\n3. Then, another layer: 1+3 times the previous result.\n\nSo, actually, there are nine layers, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let me confirm that by counting the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the first '(', each subsequent '(' adds another layer. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1+3(' adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times I see '1+3(':\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 1+3\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is not preceded by a '3(', so maybe there are eight layers. Let me check again. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8)\n\nBut looking at the original expression, how many times does the pattern repeat? Let me parse it:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, if I count the number of times I see \"1+3(\", that should tell me the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's eight instances of \"1+3(\". So that would mean there are eight layers inside the initial 3*(...). Therefore, the innermost expression is (1+3), and then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). So, in total, there are eight layers inside the first multiplication by 3. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(Layer 8)\n\nWhere Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\n...\n\nLayer 1 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, to compute this, I can start from Layer 1 and work my way up to Layer 8, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841\n\nLet me compute that: 3*9841\n\nWell, 9841 * 3. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 29,523.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3 again:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, carry over 1\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 (carry) = 25, carry over 2\n\n9*3 = 27 + 2 (carry) = 29.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n9841\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 9841*3 is indeed 29,523.\n\nAlternatively, to verify, I can compute 9841 * 3 as follows:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 29,523.\n\nI wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can save a lot of time, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about this.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In this case, n is 8 layers inside the initial 3. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me consider the general form. Let's denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_8.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such relations often have closed-form solutions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_k.\n\nThe recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When k=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, for k=8, L_8=9841, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_8=3*9841=29,523.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms our earlier step-by-step calculation. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I might have just calculated each layer step by step, as I did initially, but it's good to know that there's a formula behind it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\nL_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}\n\nThis can be expanded as:\n\nL_k = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{k-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{k-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion:\n\nL_k = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_{k-3}\n\nAnd so on, until we reach L_1.\n\nSo, for L_8, it would be:\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^7 + 3^8*L_0\n\nWait, but L_1 is 1 + 3, so L_0 would be 1? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nActually, if we consider the recurrence L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\nIf I unroll the recurrence, it becomes:\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4)...))\n\nWhich, when expanded, is a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^7 + 3^8*4.\n\nWait, that might not be exactly correct, but let me see.\n\nActually, each time you unroll the recurrence, you add another term. So, starting from L_1=4=1+3.\n\nThen, L_2=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=13.\n\nL_3=1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40.\n\nWait, that's the same as 1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40.\n\nSimilarly, L_4=1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81=121.\n\nSo, in general, L_k is the sum from i=0 to k of 3^i, but wait, no, because L_1=4=1+3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nSimilarly, L_2=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=13=3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, L_3=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40=3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait a second, so in general, L_k= sum_{i=0}^{k} 3^i.\n\nBut wait, when k=1, sum from i=0 to 1 of 3^i=1 + 3=4, which matches L_1=4.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, sum from i=0 to 2 of 3^i=1 + 3 + 9=13, which is L_2=13.\n\nTherefore, in general, L_k= sum_{i=0}^{k} 3^i.\n\nBut the sum of a geometric series is (3^{k+1} - 1)/(3 - 1)= (3^{k+1} -1)/2, which matches the closed-form formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, indeed, L_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for k=8, L_8=(3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, which is exactly what we had.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_8=3*9841=29,523.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by recognizing a geometric series pattern. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding step by step or using the closed-form formula for the geometric series, we find the value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 8 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{29523}"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, so let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last term, which is $1+3$. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, $1 + 3$ equals 4. Got that. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be $1 + 3$ times the result we just got. Wait, no, let me check. The structure is $3(1 + 3(...))$, so actually, each time, it's 3 multiplied by the inner expression, which itself is 1 plus 3 times another inner expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write this down more systematically. Let me try to parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, and so on, up to Level 9 since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, counting the number of opening parentheses, I see that there are nine sets, so each level will be one more than the previous.\n\nWait, maybe I should number them from the inside out. So, the innermost is Level 1: $1 + 3$, then Level 2 would be $1 + 3 \\times$ (Level 1 result), Level 3 would be $1 + 3 \\times$ (Level 2 result), and so on, up to Level 9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3 times that Level 9 result. Wait, no, actually, the expression is $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))$, so the outermost operation is 3 times the first parentheses, which itself contains 1 plus 3 times another parentheses, and so on. So maybe the levels are from inside out, starting at Level 1 as the innermost.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let me define each level as follows:\n\n- Level 1: $1 + 3$\n- Level 2: $1 + 3 \\times$ (Level 1)\n- Level 3: $1 + 3 \\times$ (Level 2)\n- ...\n- Level 9: $1 + 3 \\times$ (Level 8)\n- Then, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each time you go one level out, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, and then moving outward. So, starting from Level 1, which is the innermost, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nLevel 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nLevel 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\nLevel 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\nLevel 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\nLevel 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nLevel 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nLevel 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nLevel 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9, so that would be 3 \u00d7 29524.

Correct.\n\nLevel6:1 +3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel7:1 +3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel8:1 +3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel9:1 +3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Since each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, and going up to a_9, then the total expression is 3\u00d7a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A\u00d73^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C =1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A\u00d73^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A\u00d73^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4 \u21d2 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 A=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)\u00d73^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9=3\u00d729524=88572. So that's consistent with what I computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each level is building up a geometric series. Since each term is 1 + 3\u00d7(previous term), it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but with an added 1 each time. But since we're dealing with a finite number of terms, the formula we derived using the recurrence relation is more straightforward.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression manually, step by step, to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute $1 + 3$ = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward: $1 + 3(4)$ = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: $1 + 3(13)$ = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: $1 + 3(40)$ = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: $1 + 3(121)$ = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: $1 + 3(364)$ = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: $1 + 3(1093)$ = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: $1 + 3(3280)$ = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: $1 + 3(9841)$ = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times this, so 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute 3\u00d729524 using another method.\n\nLet me break down 29524:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 3\u00d720000 = 60000.\n\n3\u00d79000 = 27000.\n\n3\u00d7500 = 1500.\n\n3\u00d724 = 72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 +72=88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another approach. Let me see if 88572 divided by 3 is 29524.\n\n88572 \u00f7 3: 3 \u00d7 29000=87000. 88572 -87000=1572.\n\n3 \u00d7 500=1500. 1572 -1500=72.\n\n3 \u00d724=72. So, total is 29000 + 500 +24=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that's a good check.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost level (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, that part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. \n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that simplifies to 13. Now, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's 40. Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 121? That seems a bit large, but okay, let's keep going.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWow, 364. I can see this is growing quickly. Let me proceed step by step.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThat's 1093. Continuing.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nHmm, 3280. Okay, moving on.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThat's 9841. Now, the next expression.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWow, that's 29524. \n\nWait, let me check how many levels I've gone through. The original expression has multiple layers. Let me recount. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9. So, starting from the innermost, I have 9 layers. So, I've computed up to the 9th layer, which gave me 29524. Now, I think I need to multiply this by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, no. Let me make sure. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time I'm multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So, I think I need to proceed step by step, each time substituting the inner expression with its value.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Let me try to visualize the expression more clearly. Let me write it out with labels to see each layer.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, and then the outermost expression is 3*(E9).\n\nWait, no, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) so each Ei is 1 + 3*E(i+1). So, starting from E9, which is (1 + 3), then E8 is 1 + 3*E9, E7 is 1 + 3*E8, and so on until E0, which is the innermost. Wait, perhaps I should index it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, as I did before, but let me recount to ensure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) \u2192 first opening parenthesis after the first 3.\n\nThen, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), so that's the second opening parenthesis. Let me count them all.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n- The first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- Then each inner layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me see: starting from the first 3, each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Because after the first 3, there are 9 more opening parentheses. Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of times 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term that starts with 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4, then each layer wraps around that with 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me check: the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds one more 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, meaning I need to compute 9 layers, each time substituting the innermost result into the next layer.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went through 9 layers and ended up with 29524, then I thought I needed to multiply by 3 again, but perhaps I was wrong.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3)=4. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer as E1 to E9, where E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps E1 is the innermost, E2 is the next one, up to E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1+3)=4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so perhaps I should compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 4, then 13, 40, etc., up to 9 layers, and then multiply the 9th layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went through 9 layers and got 29524, then I thought I needed to multiply by 3 again, but perhaps that's incorrect because the outermost layer is already 3*(E9), where E9 is the result of the 9th layer. So, perhaps I need to compute 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous) and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I started from the innermost as E1 = 4, then E2 = 13, E3 = 40, E4 = 121, E5 = 364, E6 = 1093, E7 = 3280, E8 = 9841, E9 = 29524. So, after 9 layers, E9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9, which would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let me recount the layers:\n\n1. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check each step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(E9), so E9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually computing each layer, but since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote each E_n as 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, E1 is 4, E2 is 1 + 3*E1, etc., so the general formula is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, with E9 being the outermost.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to index it in reverse, so that E1 is the innermost, E2 is the next, up to E9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 13\n\nE3 = 40\n\nE4 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE6 = 1093\n\nE7 = 3280\n\nE8 = 9841\n\nE9 = 29524\n\nHmm, let's see the pattern in E_n.\n\nLooking at E2 = 13, which is 4*3 + 1 = 13.\n\nE3 = 13*3 + 1 = 40.\n\nE4 = 40*3 + 1 = 121.\n\nE5 = 121*3 + 1 = 364.\n\nE6 = 364*3 + 1 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1093*3 + 1 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 3280*3 + 1 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 9841*3 + 1 = 29524.\n\nSo, each E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. So, the recurrence relation is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: E_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E_n^(p) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for E1, n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor E2, n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, E3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 81 -1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for E9, n=9: E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Since E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula without computing each step. Let me see.\n\nSince the expression is 3*E9, and E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't find any errors in the steps, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation, the solution can be expressed as a geometric series, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer1 is 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer2 is 3(1 + Layer1). Since Layer1 is 4, this becomes 3(1 + 4). Let me compute that: 1 + 4 is 5, and then 3 times 5 is 15. So, Layer2 is 15.\n\nNext, Layer3 is 3(1 + Layer2). Layer2 is 15, so 1 + 15 is 16. Then, 3 times 16 is 48. So, Layer3 is 48.\n\nMoving on to Layer4: 3(1 + Layer3). Layer3 is 48, so 1 + 48 is 49. Then, 3 times 49 is 147. Layer4 is 147.\n\nLayer5: 3(1 + Layer4). Layer4 is 147, so 1 + 147 is 148. 3 times 148 is... let me compute that. 148 times 3: 100*3 is 300, 40*3 is 120, 8*3 is 24. Adding those together: 300 + 120 is 420, plus 24 is 444. So, Layer5 is 444.\n\nLayer6: 3(1 + Layer5). Layer5 is 444, so 1 + 444 is 445. 3 times 445: Let's see, 400*3 is 1200, 40*3 is 120, 5*3 is 15. Adding those together: 1200 + 120 is 1320, plus 15 is 1335. So, Layer6 is 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3(1 + Layer6). Layer6 is 1335, so 1 + 1335 is 1336. 3 times 1336: Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 300*3 is 900, 30*3 is 90, 6*3 is 18. Adding them up: 3000 + 900 is 3900, plus 90 is 3990, plus 18 is 4008. So, Layer7 is 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3(1 + Layer7). Layer7 is 4008, so 1 + 4008 is 4009. 3 times 4009: Let me compute that. 4000*3 is 12,000, 9*3 is 27. So, 12,000 + 27 is 12,027. Therefore, Layer8 is 12,027.\n\nFinally, Layer9: 3(1 + Layer8). Layer8 is 12,027, so 1 + 12,027 is 12,028. Now, 3 times 12,028: Let's break it down. 12,000*3 is 36,000, 28*3 is 84. Adding those together: 36,000 + 84 is 36,084. So, Layer9 is 36,084.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027. Correct.\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each layer seems to check out. Therefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, but when I started counting from Layer1 as the innermost, I might have miscounted. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's one set. Then each subsequent layer adds another set.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLet me parse it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Let's call this L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out is (1 + 3*(L1)): So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this L2: 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: (1 + 3*(L2)): 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L3: 40.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. L4: 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. L5: 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L6: 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L7: 3280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L8: 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. L9: 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that's different from my previous calculation. Now I'm confused. Did I miscount the layers earlier? Because in my first approach, I ended up with 36,084, but now when I recount, I'm getting 29,524.\n\nI must have miscounted the layers initially. Let me try to figure out where I went wrong.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. The first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)).\n\n2. Inside that, there's another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions.\n\nEach opening parenthesis starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nContinuing, I think there are 9 layers in total because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, let's try this again, more carefully.\n\nLet me define each layer properly.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9, which is 3*29,524.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check the original expression again. The entire expression is 3*(Layer9), but Layer9 is already the outermost layer. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 3*(...), where the ... is the inner expression.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around with (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29,524.\n\nWait, so that would be 3*29,524 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29,524, I thought that was the final result, but actually, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, the final answer would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to Layer9 as 36,084, that was after multiplying by 3 at each step, but perhaps I misapplied the layers.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether each layer includes the multiplication by 3 or not. Let me clarify.\n\nEach layer after the innermost is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I included the multiplication by 3 in each layer, which led to 36,084. But that was incorrect because the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9), not 3*(Layer8). So, I think the correct approach is to compute each (1 + 3*previous_layer) up to Layer9, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, let me confirm the structure again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression, which is a series of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, to compute this correctly, I need to compute the innermost (1 + 3) first, then substitute back into the next layer, and so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, let's do that again, carefully:\n\nCompute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, now, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29,524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29,524.\n\nCalculating that: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this carefully:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer9 as 36,084, I think I was including the multiplication by 3 in each layer, which was incorrect because the outermost layer is just 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression, which after 9 layers is 29,524. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut now I'm getting conflicting results based on how I count the layers. Let me try a different approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let's see if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form solution.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the inner expression evaluates to 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that: 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer step by step, I got 29,524 as the inner expression, and then 3*29,524 is 88,572. So, that aligns with the formula approach.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 36,084. It seems that I incorrectly included the multiplication by 3 in each layer beyond the ninth, which was not necessary. The correct approach is to compute the inner expression up to Layer9 as 29,524, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nTo double-check, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match my manual calculations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the inner expression is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers and including the multiplication by 3 in each step beyond the ninth layer, which was incorrect. The correct approach is to compute the inner expression using the formula or step-by-step substitution, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through the problem and verifying with both step-by-step substitution and a formula approach, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
