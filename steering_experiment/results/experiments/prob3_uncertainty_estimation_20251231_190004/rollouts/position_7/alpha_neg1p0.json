    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that result. Let me try to write this out step by step. \n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost parentheses is 1+3. So, let's compute that first. 1+3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so now we're at 40. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Alright, so now we have 121. Next layer out: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives us 364. So now, the result is 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364. Let's do that: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So now, we're at 1093. \n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 which is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. So, now we have 3280. \n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*3280. Let's break that down. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. So, the result here is 9841. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 which is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, now we're at 29524. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the last step. So, when I compute 3*9841, let me do it more carefully. 9841 times 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Okay, so that seems correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. So, now we're at 88573. \n\nWait, hold on. That seems like a big jump. Let me double-check the computation for 3*29524. Maybe I should compute it digit by digit to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 29524 multiplied by 3: \n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading it from the top, it's 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that seems correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives us 265720. So, now we're at 265720. \n\nWait a second, that seems really large. Let me verify that. 88573 times 3: Let me compute it step by step. \n\n88573\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3*5 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3*8 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3*8 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n3*0 (since there's nothing left, but we have a carryover of 2, so write down 2)\nWait, that can't be right because 88573 is a 5-digit number, so when we multiply by 3, it should be 88573*3. Let me compute it correctly:\n\n88573 * 3:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3*5 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3*8 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3*8 = 24, plus 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\nSince there are no more digits, write down the carry over 2.\nSo, reading from top, it's 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Okay, so that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute that. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives us 797161. \n\nWait, that seems even larger. Let me check 265720 * 3. \n\n265720 * 3:\n3*0 = 0\n3*2 = 6\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3*5 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3*6 = 18, plus 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1\n3*2 = 6, plus 1 = 7\nSo, reading from top, it's 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Okay, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*797161. Let me compute that. 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives us 2391484. \n\nWait, that seems extremely large. Let me verify 797161 * 3. \n\n797161 * 3:\n3*1 = 3\n3*6 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n3*1 = 3, plus 1 = 4\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3*9 = 27, plus 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n3*7 = 21, plus 2 = 23, write down 3, carry over 2\n3*0 (since there's nothing left, but we have a carryover of 2, so write down 2)\nWait, that's not correct because 797161 is a 6-digit number, so multiplying by 3:\n\nLet me write it out properly:\n\n797161\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n1*3 = 3\n6*3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n1*3 = 3, plus 1 = 4\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n9*3 = 27, plus 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7*3 = 21, plus 2 = 23, write down 3, carry over 2\nThere's no digit left, so write down the carry over 2.\nSo, the result is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. Okay, that seems correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*2391484. Let me compute that. 3*2000000 is 6000000, 3*300000 is 900000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*400 is 1200, 3*80 is 240, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 6000000 + 900000 is 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452. Then, adding 1 gives us 7174453. \n\nWait, that's getting even bigger. Let me check 2391484 * 3. \n\n2391484 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n8*3 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n4*3 = 12, plus 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1\n1*3 = 3, plus 1 = 4\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\n3*3 = 9, plus 2 = 11, write down 1, carry over 1\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 = 7\nSo, reading from top, it's 7174452. Then, adding 1 gives 7174453. Okay, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*7174453. Let me compute that. 3*7000000 is 21000000, 3*1000000 is 3000000, 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*40000 is 120000, 3*4000 is 12000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 21000000 + 3000000 is 24000000, plus 2100000 is 26100000, plus 120000 is 26220000, plus 12000 is 26232000, plus 1500 is 26233500, plus 9 is 26233509. Then, adding 1 gives us 26233510. \n\nWait, that seems too big. Let me verify 7174453 * 3. \n\n7174453 * 3:\n3*3 = 9\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n4*3 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n4*3 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n7*3 = 21, plus 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n1*3 = 3, plus 2 = 5\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\nThere's nothing left, so write down the carry over 2.\nWait, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly:\n\n7174453\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*7 = 21, plus 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n3*1 = 3, plus 2 = 5\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\nThere's nothing left, so write down the carry over 2.\nSo, reading from top, it's 21523359. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate 7174453 * 3 properly.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n7174453\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*7 = 21, plus 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n3*1 = 3, plus 2 = 5\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\nThere's no digit left, so write down the carry over 2.\nSo, the result is 21523359. Then, adding 1 gives us 21523360. \n\nWait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. I think I messed up the place values earlier. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n7174453\ntimes 3\n--------\n3*3 = 9\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*4 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n3*7 = 21, plus 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2\n3*1 = 3, plus 2 = 5\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\nSo, the digits from right to left are 9,5,3,3,2,5,1, and then the carry over 2 at the beginning. So, reading it as a number, it's 21523359. Then, adding 1 gives 21523360. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 7174453*3=21523359, but when I broke it down step by step, I had 21000000 + 3000000 + 2100000 + 120000 + 12000 + 1500 + 9, which added up to 26233509, which is incorrect. I think I messed up the place values there. So, the correct result is 21523359, then adding 1 gives 21523360. \n\nSo, I need to correct that. Therefore, the result after this layer is 21523360. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*21523360. Let me compute that. 3*20000000 is 60000000, 3*1000000 is 3000000, 3*500000 is 1500000, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*600 is 1800, 3*60 is 180. Adding those together: 60000000 + 3000000 is 63000000, plus 1500000 is 64500000, plus 60000 is 64560000, plus 9000 is 64569000, plus 1800 is 64570800, plus 180 is 64570980. Then, adding 1 gives us 64570981. \n\nWait, let me verify 21523360 * 3. \n\n21523360\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n0*3 = 0\n6*3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n3*3 = 9, plus 1 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n3*2 = 6, plus 1 = 7\n3*3 = 9\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3*1 = 3, plus 1 = 4\n3*2 = 6\nSo, reading from top, it's 64570080. Wait, that's not matching my previous calculation. Let me do it step by step:\n\n21523360\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n0*3 = 0\n6*3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n3*3 = 9, plus 1 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n3*2 = 6, plus 1 = 7\n3*3 = 9\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n3*1 = 3, plus 1 = 4\n3*2 = 6\nSo, the digits from right to left are 0,8,0,7,9,5,4,6. So, the number is 64570080. Then, adding 1 gives us 64570081. \n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake in breaking down the multiplication. The correct result is 64570080, then adding 1 gives 64570081. \n\nSo, now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*64570081. Let me compute that. 3*60000000 is 180000000, 3*4000000 is 12000000, 3*500000 is 1500000, 3*70000 is 210000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 180000000 + 12000000 is 192000000, plus 1500000 is 193500000, plus 210000 is 193710000, plus 2400 is 193712400, plus 3 is 193712403. Then, adding 1 gives us 193712404. \n\nWait, let me verify 64570081 * 3. \n\n64570081\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n1*3 = 3\n8*3 = 24, write down 4, carry over 2\n0*3 = 0, plus 2 = 2\n0*3 = 0\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n0*3 = 0, plus 2 = 2\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n4*3 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n6*3 = 18, plus 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1\nThere's nothing left, so write down the carry over 1.\nSo, reading from top, it's 193710243. Then, adding 1 gives 193710244. \n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Let me do it properly:\n\n64570081\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n1*3 = 3\n8*3 = 24, write down 4, carry over 2\n0*3 = 0, plus 2 = 2\n0*3 = 0\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n0*3 = 0, plus 2 = 2\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n4*3 = 12, plus 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1\n6*3 = 18, plus 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1\nSo, the digits from right to left are 3,4,2,0,1,2,5,3,9, and the carry over 1 at the beginning. So, the number is 193710243. Then, adding 1 gives 193710244. \n\nWait, so my earlier breakdown was incorrect.

Let me compute that. 3*500000000 is 1500000000, 3*80000000 is 240000000, 3*1000000 is 3000000, 3*100000 is 300000, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*30 is 90, 3*3 is 9.

Then, adding 1 gives us 1746011200. \n\nWait, let me verify 581130733 * 3. \n\n581130733\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*3 = 9\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n0*3 = 0, plus 2 = 2\n3*3 = 9\n1*3 = 3\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n1*3 = 3, plus 2 = 5\n8*3 = 24, write down 4, carry over 2\n5*3 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\nThere's nothing left, so write down the carry over 1.\nSo, reading from top, it's 1743392199. Then, adding 1 gives 1743392200. \n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Let me do it properly:\n\n581130733\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*3 = 9\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n0*3 = 0, plus 2 = 2\n3*3 = 9\n1*3 = 3\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n1*3 = 3, plus 2 = 5\n8*3 = 24, write down 4, carry over 2\n5*3 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\nSo, the digits from right to left are 9,9,1,2,9,3,1,5,4,7, and the carry over 1 at the beginning. So, the number is 1743392199. Then, adding 1 gives 1743392200. \n\nWait, so my earlier breakdown was incorrect. The correct result is 1743392199, then adding 1 gives 1743392200. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1743392200. Let me compute that. 3*1000000000 is 3000000000, 3*700000000 is 2100000000, 3*40000000 is 120000000, 3*3000000 is 9000000, 3*300000 is 900000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*200 is 600. Adding those together: 3000000000 + 2100000000 is 5100000000, plus 120000000 is 5220000000, plus 9000000 is 5229000000, plus 90"

Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the inside and working my way out. \n\nLet me label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, when I count the number of parentheses, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a closing one, so maybe it's 8 layers? Hmm, maybe I should just count them. Let's see: the expression is 3(...), and inside that, there's another 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. \n\nLooking at it, starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a term that starts with 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I go one layer out, I have another 3(...). So, from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1+3*(Layer1), that's Layer 2. Then, Layer3 is 1+3*(Layer2), and so on. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Let's see: starting from the end, the first closing parenthesis is after the last 3, then each time I go back, I have another closing parenthesis. Let me count them: the expression ends with 3)), so that's one closing parenthesis. Then, moving left, each time I see another ), so let me count them:\n\nStarting from the end:\n1. The last ) is after the innermost 3, so that's the first layer.\n2. The next ) is after the next 3, so that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing this way, each ) corresponds to a layer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer1). So,\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, Final Result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that calculation again because 29524 *3 might be 88572. Let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly calculated each layer, because if I made a mistake in one layer, it will propagate through all the subsequent layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to verify.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3(1+3(...)), so after computing Layer9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get 88572. So, that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me check: maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count how many times I applied the 1+3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) =4 (Layer1)\n2. 1+3*4=13 (Layer2)\n3. 1+3*13=40 (Layer3)\n4. 1+3*40=121 (Layer4)\n5. 1+3*121=364 (Layer5)\n6. 1+3*364=1093 (Layer6)\n7. 1+3*1093=3280 (Layer7)\n8. 1+3*3280=9841 (Layer8)\n9. 1+3*9841=29524 (Layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time moving outward, and then the outermost 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the first 3(...), inside that, another 3(...), etc.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), which is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another 3*(...). So, each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we have \"1+3(\", so let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), so that's Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, we have another 1+3*(Layer1), which is Layer2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(Layer2) is Layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, up to Layer9, as I did before.\n\nSo, 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(...). So, the calculation as I did before is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly multiplied each time. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, Layer9 is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I'm wondering if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me think about it. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 +3 =4, and a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1} for n >=2.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C =3*C +1.\n\nSolving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1= A*3^1 + (-1/2) =3A -1/2=4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually, but it's good to know the general formula for future reference.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4. By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer a\u2099 can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Calculating up to the ninth layer gives a value of 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That way, each time I solve a part, I can substitute it back into the next part, simplifying the whole expression step by step. Let me try that.\n\nLet's rewrite the expression to make it clearer:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each set is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost one, which is 1 + 3, that's the simplest part.\n\nLet me write this down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\n3. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 2), and so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, I can structure this as follows, starting from the innermost and working outward:\n\nLet me label each step for clarity. Let's say:\n\n- Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3.\n- Step 2: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1).\n- Step 3: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2).\n- Continue this process until all layers are computed.\n- Finally, multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nSo, let's go through each step one by one.\n\n**Step 1:** Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 4.\n\n**Step 2:** Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1).\n\nThat would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the result of the second layer is 13.\n\n**Step 3:** Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2).\n\nThat is 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, the third layer gives us 40.\n\n**Step 4:** Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3).\n\nThat is 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAdd 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, the fourth layer is 121.\n\n**Step 5:** Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4).\n\nThat is 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute 3*121: 3*121.

Compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3=27000,\n\n800*3=2400,\n\n40*3=120,\n\n1*3=3.\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400,\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520,\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000,\n\n9000*3=27000,\n\n500*3=1500,\n\n20*3=60,\n\n4*3=12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20,000*3=60,000,\n\n9,000*3=27,000,\n\n500*3=1,500,\n\n20*3=60,\n\n4*3=12.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this without computing each step manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that for a second.\n\nThis expression is a finite geometric series, isn't it? Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1.\n\nWait, let me see. If I denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a9.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the term would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nGiven a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as a2=13.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, as a3=40.\n\nYes, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the innermost term, which is a1=4, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost term before multiplying by 3 is a9.\n\nCompute a9 using the formula:\n\na9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier in Step 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula confirms the result we obtained step by step.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms with a repeating pattern, which can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the recurrence relation confirms the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down. That's 1 + 3, which is 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so that would be 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, then this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the next layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), which is 1 + 3*40. Let me compute 3*40 first, which is 120, and then add 1 to get 121. So, that's 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, that layer simplifies to 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1 to get 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1 to get 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1 to get 9841.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1 to get 29524.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then add 1 to get 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. Breaking it down: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then add 1 to get 265720.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we're adding another layer. So, if I have 9 layers, I should have computed 9 times. Let me recount the steps I took:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next: 1+3*4=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, after computing all 9 layers, the outermost result is 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working outward, the value inside the parentheses is 29524, and then we multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I went one step further and ended up with 265720, but that was because I had an extra layer. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count how many layers there are. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer3:1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9:1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers inside the parentheses, and then the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, my initial computation was correct up to Layer9 being 29524, and then multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was stepping through, I went beyond Layer9 because I thought there were more layers. So, perhaps I confused the number of layers. Let me recount:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting after the first 3(, each ( adds a layer.\n\nLet's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of ( after the first 3: There are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers inside the parentheses, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, to recap, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's list each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct computation. Let me verify it another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, setting A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just double-check the arithmetic in case I made any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. By systematically simplifying each layer from the inside out, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the value inside the parentheses is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count them: \n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outwards, each time adding another layer. So, maybe I can start by computing the innermost part first. Let me try that. \n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that might be a good way to approach it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to Layer 2:\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3:\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39.

So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7:\nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nLet me compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279.

So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which can throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can save time and reduce the chance of errors.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric sequence or perhaps something that can be modeled with recursion.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2.\n\nSo, we can write this recurrence relation as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3C\n\nTherefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, now, for Layer 9, which is a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms my previous result. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which might have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there were only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nBut it's good to know that recognizing the recurrence relation can lead to a formula, which is helpful for more complex or longer expressions. It's a useful problem-solving technique: breaking down the problem, looking for patterns, and then generalizing if possible.\n\nSo, in summary, by either method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations\u2014we arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward.

Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9.

    "text": " That makes sense because each inner expression is part of the larger one, so I need to solve the innermost one first and then work my way outwards.\n\nAlright, let's start by identifying how many layers there are. I'll count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep the nesting goes. Let me see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a layer. Let's count: \n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3(1+3).\n3. Next, 1+3(1+3(1+3)).\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by something. Let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. Since it's nested nine times, I think I need to compute this from the innermost parentheses outwards. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost. Wait, actually, in the expression, the innermost part is 1+3, so maybe I should start from there and work my way out.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Let me check the structure again. The innermost is 1+3, which is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as L1 to L9, but actually, looking at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, which is L1, then the next is 1+3*(L1), which would be L2, and so on, up to L9, which is the outermost before the final 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(L9), where L9 is the entire nested expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me try to compute each layer one by one.\n\nSo, let's start:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3.\n\nI can compute this as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNow, 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I correctly identified the layers. I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), and each time, we're adding another layer outward. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8.

So, starting from L1:1+3=4\n\nThen L2:1+3*L1=1+12=13\n\nL3:1+3*L2=1+39=40\n\nL4:1+3*L3=1+120=121\n\nL5:1+3*L4=1+363=364\n\nL6:1+3*L5=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1+3*L6=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1+3*L7=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1+3*L8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication or in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, that's not the right way to break it down. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the calculations seem correct. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we arrive at the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). The innermost term is 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying how many layers there are here. I'll count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1. Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first layer is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). Then each time, inside another 3 times (1 + ...). Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Hmm, I think it's nine layers deep because there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check again: starting from the innermost, the last 1+3 is the innermost, and each time we go out, it's another layer. So the innermost is 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added 1, and so on. So, maybe it's 8 layers? Wait, maybe I should just count the number of 1+3(...). Let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3)))))))))) So, each time, it's another layer. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of times I see \"3(\" starting from the left. The first is 3(, then inside that is another 3(, and so on. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3( is layer 1, then inside that is layer 2, and so on until the innermost 1+3. Let me count the number of 3( before the first 1+3. Hmm, it's 9 layers because each time you go in, it's another 3(. So, the innermost part is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that. So, that's 9 layers. Wait, actually, when I count the number of 3( before the first 1+3, I see 9 instances of 3(, which would mean 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then each time we go out, it's another layer up to layer 9. Wait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outward, so layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and each outer layer adds another 3(1+...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers in total. Alternatively, maybe I should just start solving it step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, regardless of the number of layers, just to see how it works.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, if the innermost is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer is 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the third layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, the fourth layer is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Fifth layer is 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: let's compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900+192=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Sixth layer is 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Seventh layer is 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Eighth layer is 9841.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Ninth layer is 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3 times the entire expression, right? So, the outermost layer is 3*(the result we just computed). So, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572, so 87000 + 1572 is 88572. So, the final result would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check each multiplication step again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364. Let's compute that again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093. Let's compute that: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute this carefully: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 41*3=123. So, adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 123 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*29,524. Let's compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding those together:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step? Because if this expression had more layers, say 20 or 30, it would be impractical to compute each step manually. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression that can represent this.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which we found to be 29,524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nNow, for a general case where there are k layers, the expression would be 3*a_k, where a_k is defined recursively as a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nI recall that such a recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Let me try to derive it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe general solution to such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution, a_p(n). Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = a_h(n) + a_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result directly without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(a(9)), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 times the inner expression, which itself has 9 layers. So, that's correct.\n\nLet me just confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Starting from the innermost 1+3, each time we have a layer that adds another 3*(...). So, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, yes, 9 layers, so a(9) as we computed.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula for 9 layers.\n\nCompute a(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is adding a term that's a power of 3. Let me see:\n\nFrom the closed-form solution, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a(9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's another way to look at it, confirming the result.\n\nSo, in summary, by recognizing the pattern, deriving a closed-form formula, and verifying each step, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By solving from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed step by step until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is calculated efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested pattern where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the Outermost Layer:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   The closed-form formula for the nth layer is a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a(9) = 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer one by one without getting confused. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3, it's followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the left, I have 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another set. Let me see, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers? Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3s. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, I can think of each nested expression as a separate step.\n\nLet me try to parse this expression. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). That something is 3 multiplied by another (1 + something else), and this continues until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). So, it's like a chain of 3s and 1s. Maybe it's easier if I label each step as I go inwards.\n\nLet me start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 1)). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 2: Compute 3*(4) = 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo now, the next layer out is (1 + 3*(result from Step 2)). Let's compute that.\n\nStep 3: Compute 3*(13) = 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3*(40)).\n\nStep 4: Compute 3*40 = 120. Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*121).\n\nStep 5: Compute 3*121 = 363. Add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*364).\n\nStep 6: Compute 3*364. Let me do that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*1093).\n\nStep 7: Compute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*3280).\n\nStep 8: Compute 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841).\n\nStep 9: Compute 3*9841. Let's break this down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, which is 3 multiplied by the result from Step 9.\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*29524. Let's compute this step by step: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\nWell, 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000.\n\nSubtract 476 \u00d7 3 = 1,428.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right approach. Alternatively, 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Each step involved computing the innermost parentheses first, moving outward, and then multiplying by 3 each time. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. I think I did each multiplication and addition carefully. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: if I have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), it's similar to a geometric series or something else.\n\nWait, actually, each step is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers after the initial 3(...).\n\nWait, actually, let's count how many layers there are. The expression starts with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), and each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of 3s before the first 1: starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then inside, each 3 is part of the next layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see how many times we have the 3*(1 + ...) structure. Let me count the number of times I applied the step: from Step 1 to Step 10, but actually, each step after the first is a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me check: the initial expression has 9 layers inside the outer 3. Because I can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), each nested deeper. So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, when I computed up to Step 9, that was the innermost 9 layers, and then Step 10 was the outermost 3 multiplied by that result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 9 steps after the initial 3, but actually, let me count the number of times I computed the inner expressions:\n\nStarting from (1 + 3) as Step 1, then each next step adds another layer, so for 9 layers, I would have 9 steps, and then the final Step 10 is multiplying by the outermost 3. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value after n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 -3)/2 =177,144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

    "text": " That makes sense because in the order of operations, parentheses come first, so starting from the inside seems logical.\n\nAlright, let me write this out more clearly to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 1 plus 3 times something. So, maybe I can start by solving the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me count the number of nested expressions to make sure I don't miss any. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, there are nine layers in total. Hmm, that's a lot, but maybe a pattern will emerge as I compute each layer.\n\nLet me start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, I have:\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4)\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I need to be more precise. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. So, let me define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, L1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing on, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression isn't 1 + 3*(...), but rather 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, not just part of the nested terms. So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? So, the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me check that again. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost layers up to L9 = 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 3 * 29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3 * 524 = 1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me verify the calculation again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when I was computing the layers, I ended up with L9 = 29524, but that was after computing 1 + 3*L8. So, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, L9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost, that's 9 layers. So, L1 to L9. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nWait, let me think. If I have a term like L = 1 + 3*L', where L' is the next layer, then this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for L_n, where n is the number of layers.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n.\n\nGiven L1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L1 = 4, which is when n=1.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L2=13.\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*L9, where L9 is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(L9), where L9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so:\n\n3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, either way, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer step by step again:\n\nL1=4\n\nL2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nL3=1 + 3*13=40\n\nL4=1 + 3*40=121\n\nL5=1 + 3*121=364\n\nL6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nL7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nL8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nL9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4)=1+12=13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous calculations.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " So, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, simplifying each step as I go. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, okay, so each time, I have a 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus another 3 times the next inner expression. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses here because each \"1+3\" is a separate level. Wait, let me count them. Starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on, all the way out to the ninth level. So, maybe I should compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me start by assigning each layer a level to make it easier. Let's say level 1 is the innermost, and level 9 is the outermost. So, level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, level 2: 1 + 3*(level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Level 3: 1 + 3*(level 2), and so on up to level 9. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the entire expression from level 9. So, after computing Level 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working outwards. So, perhaps I should label the innermost as level 1, then level 2 is the next one out, up to level 9 being the outermost. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should number the innermost parentheses as level 1, then each subsequent layer as level 2, 3, etc., up to level 9. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's level 1. Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(level 1), which is level 2, and so on until level 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(level 9). So, perhaps I should compute level 1 to level 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to level 9 as 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's see, 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total would be 88572. But wait, let me check if I did the levels correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the levels. Let me recount:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the innermost. Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Each time, it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify if that's correct because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count how many times 1 + 3*( occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))).\n\nEach \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is level 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each \"1+3(\" adds a new level. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a geometric series. Because each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me think: Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with a_1:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me verify with another method to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such a series.\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying using a closed-form solution, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. We compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards.\n\n1. **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer (Level 9), we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1+3), and working my way outwards. Let me number these layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. \n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, so if I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward, I can eventually find the value of Layer 9 and then multiply it by 3 to get the final answer. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... Let me calculate that. 9841 times 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, we need to compute 3*29524. Let's do that. 29524 times 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nTotal expression: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems like a lot, but each step seems to follow correctly. Let me just verify a couple of the layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting with Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nFinal multiplication: 29524*3 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Let me see if that's possible.\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me find a closed-form solution.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9.\n\nTherefore, L9=29524, and the final result is 3*L9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost operation is multiplying the result by 3, leading to the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first. \n\nSo, (1 + 3) equals 4. Okay, got that. Now, moving one level out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*(result from the innermost)). Since the innermost was 4, let's compute that next layer. \n\nSo, the next layer is (1 + 3*(4)). Let me compute that step by step. First, 3 multiplied by 4 is 12. Then, adding 1 to that gives me 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. \n\nAlright, now moving out another layer, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3*(40)). Calculating that, 3 times 40 is 120, and adding 1 gives 121. So, that's 121. \n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(121)). Let's see, 3 times 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. That's 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(364)). 3 times 364 is... let me calculate that. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. \n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(1093)). Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. \n\nContinuing outward, the next parentheses is (1 + 3*(3280)). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. \n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*(9841)). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. \n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(29524)). Let's compute 3*29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 88573*3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000+24000=264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. \n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573 times 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, carry over 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, carry over 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, carry over 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 2 is 26\n\nSo, writing it out: 265719. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each layer gets multiplied by 3 and adds 1, and finally, the entire result is multiplied by 3 again. After computing each step carefully, I arrive at the final answer of 265719.\n\nWait, let me just verify each step again quickly to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nEach step seems correct. I think I did it right. So, the answer should be 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, then using that result in the next layer. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost value by 3. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Continue: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Continue: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n11. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{265719}$"

Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's count the number of parentheses to make sure. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, that's layer 1, and each layer wraps around to the left. So, layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, let me check: when I look at the expression, the innermost part is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times I see a 3 followed by a (1+3(...)): the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and then each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Wait, perhaps it's better to count how many layers there are by looking at the number of times \"1+3\" appears as a nested term. Let me try to parse it:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 1+3 around it. Let's see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3*(... terms:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nWait, actually, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which itself is the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps there are 8 layers of 3*(...) after the initial 3. Hmm, maybe I should start by computing the innermost parentheses first and work my way outward.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as L1, then L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nWait, but looking back at the original expression, the outermost term is 3*(L9). So, the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. Let me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4. So that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That's Layer 2.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That's Layer 3.\n\nContinuing: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8.\n\nFinally: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3*(...\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 3*(...). But when I computed earlier, I only went up to Layer 9 as 1 + 3*Layer8, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try another approach: perhaps the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer1, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see a \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again each layer's computation to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to verify. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused because the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and I thought that each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, but maybe I should consider that each layer is built by starting from the innermost and working outwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's denote that each layer is a term in a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the sequence would be:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with the closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the closed-form formula without computing each layer. Let me try that.\n\nSince a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers. Each layer adds a 1 and multiplies by 3. So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, but that might not be accurate because each layer is nested, not additive. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, another thought: since each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, and we have 9 layers, perhaps the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to accept that computing each layer step by step is the way to go, as I did earlier, and that gives me 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Correct.\n\nTwo layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThree layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(40) = 120.\n\nWait, but according to the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=1, a1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nFor n=2, a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct.\n\nFor n=3, a3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, correct.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few more layers manually.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. We can solve this by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " That makes sense because each inner part is solved first, and then you move outward, just like how you do parentheses first in the order of operations.\n\nSo, let me try to visualize this. The innermost part is 1+3, right? Then, moving outward, each step adds another layer of 3 times that previous result plus 1. Hmm, maybe I can represent each step as a function or something. Let's think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term. Let's say starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet\u2019s call the innermost part as A. So, A = 1 + 3. Then, the next layer out would be B = 1 + 3*A. Then, the next layer would be C = 1 + 3*B, and so on. So, each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that in the next layer.\n\nWait, so maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this Layer 1: L1 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this Layer 2: L2 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: L3 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: L4 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: L5 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: L6 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: L7 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: L8 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: L9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original problem has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))). Let me count the opening parentheses: 3( ... ) So, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see: Each time we have a new (1+3(...)), that's another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then each step out adds a layer. Let me count how many times the expression 1+3(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(...)) => that's the first layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times 1+3 is used. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is used as a term.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then, moving outward, each step adds another 1+3( previous result ).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, that's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, each time you go outward, you add another layer.\n\nSo, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each 1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(...), inside that is 1+3(...), which is layer 1. Then inside that is another 1+3(...), layer 2, and so on until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 1+3 is present in the expression. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each layer outwards adds another 1+3(...). So, let's count how many 1+3 are there.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of times 1+3 is used as a term:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is one.\n\n- Then, moving outward, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3(...), inside is 1 + 3(...), which is another 1+3(...). So that's two.\n\nThen, each time you move outward, you add another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to count the number of 3's multiplied by the inner expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of layers by looking at the number of 1+3 terms. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(layer 1), that's layer 2.\n\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(layer 2), layer 3.\n\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(layer 3), layer 4.\n\n5. 1 + 3*(layer 4), layer 5.\n\n6. 1 + 3*(layer 5), layer 6.\n\n7. 1 + 3*(layer 6), layer 7.\n\n8. 1 + 3*(layer 7), layer 8.\n\n9. 1 + 3*(layer 8), layer 9.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total, right? Because each time we have another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1, which is 1+3, up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer 9 as 29524, but let me confirm that.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the Layer 9 result.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by the Layer 9 result, which is 29524.\n\nWait, so the total result would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the inner part is 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, the inner part is Layer 9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake. Because in the problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer out is 1+3*(previous), up to 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is Layer 9: 29524.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the inner part is Layer 9.\n\nSo, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Each time you have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, each time moving outward, another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))).\n\nEach time we have a new (1+3(...)), so let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), inside is 1+3(...). Then, inside that is another 1+3(...), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3( inside the expression:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...)) => that's one 1+3(...\n\nThen, inside that is another 1+3(...), so that's two.\n\nContinuing, each time we enter another layer, we add another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3( occur?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n- The first 3(1+3(1+3(...))) => 1\n\n- Then, inside that, another 1+3(1+3(...)) => 2\n\n- Then, another 1+3(1+3(...)) => 3\n\nWait, but perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each 1+3(...) adds another opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is 3( A ), where A is 1+3( B ), B is 1+3( C ), and so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, each time we have a new layer, we add another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3( appears inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(, so:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer.\n\n2. Then, moving outward, we have 1+3(1+3(...)), which is the second layer.\n\n3. Then, another 1+3(1+3(...)), third layer.\n\nContinuing until the outermost 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times we have 1+3( in the expression. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, each 1+3( is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does 1+3( occur?\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(...)) => that's one.\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, without any more parentheses. Then, moving outward, each time we have 1+3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to count the number of 1+3( instances.\n\nEach time you have 1+3(, that's a new layer. So, let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 => layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(layer1) => layer2.\n\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(layer2) => layer3.\n\nContinuing until layer9.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total. So, the innermost is layer1, and the outermost is layer9, which is then multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, each computed as L1=4, L2=13, up to L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the problem is indeed 9 layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3( occurs in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nEach time I see a 1+3(, that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(...)) => layer1.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 1+3(1+3(...)) => layer2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3 terms nested inside each other. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) in the expression.\n\nEach 1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3( occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each 1+3( adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nSo, in the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nThe number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...) is 9, because each 1+3( adds an opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), inside is 1+3(, which is one.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(, that's two.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is 1+3, without any more parentheses.\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...) is 8, because each 1+3( adds an opening parenthesis, and the innermost is just 1+3 without a parenthesis. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 1+3( appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nEach 1+3( is a new layer, so let's count how many times 1+3( appears.\n\n- After the first 3(...), we have 1+3(, that's one.\n\n- Inside that, another 1+3(, that's two.\n\n- Then another, three.\n\n- Then four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of 1+3( in the expression. But wait, the innermost is 1+3, without a 1+3(, so perhaps it's 8 layers.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that each time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3( appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3( instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) => 1\n\n2. Inside that, 1+3(1+3(...)) => 2\n\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) => 3\n\n4. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>4\n\n5. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>5\n\n6. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>6\n\n7. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>7\n\n8. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>8\n\n9. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>9\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, without any more 1+3(, so perhaps it's 8 layers. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the count of opening parentheses to determine the number of layers.\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...):\n\n- The first ( after 3( is the start.\n\n- Then, inside that, each 1+3( adds another (.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...):\n\n1. 3( starts with one (.\n\n2. Then, inside that, 1+3( adds another ( => total 2.\n\n3. Inside that, another 1+3( adds another ( => total 3.\n\n4. Then, another ( =>4.\n\n5. Another ( =>5.\n\n6. Another ( =>6.\n\n7. Another ( =>7.\n\n8. Another ( =>8.\n\n9. Another ( =>9.\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). That would suggest 9 layers.\n\nBut the innermost is 1+3, which is the 9th layer, right?\n\nWait, so if there are 9 opening parentheses, that means there are 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer1.\n\nThen, each time moving outward, adding another layer.\n\nSo, layer1: 1+3=4\n\nlayer2: 1+3*4=13\n\nlayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nlayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nlayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nlayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nlayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nlayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nlayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the problem is indeed 9 layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...).\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, each 1+3( adds an opening parenthesis. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\n- After 3(, we have 1+3( which is the first opening parenthesis.\n\n- Then, inside that, another 1+3(, that's the second.\n\n- Continuing until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3(...)? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a 1+3(, that's an opening parenthesis. So, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...) is 8, because the innermost is 1+3 without another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nStarting from 3(...):\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) => 1 opening parenthesis after 3(...).\n\n2. Inside that, 1+3(1+3(...)) => another opening parenthesis, total 2.\n\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>3.\n\n4. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>4.\n\n5. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>5.\n\n6. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>6.\n\n7. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>7.\n\n8. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>8.\n\n9. Then, 1+3(...)) =>9.\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, which doesn't have an opening parenthesis after it, so perhaps the number of opening parentheses is 8.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me write out the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., Ln.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L9, because the expression has 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of times 1+3 is used as a term. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, in the expression, how many 1+3(...) are there?\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 1+3*(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps another way: The number of times we have 1+3( is equal to the number of layers. So, each 1+3( adds a new layer.\n\nSo, in the expression, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer. So, how many times does 1+3( appear in the expression?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nEach time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer. So, starting from the first 1+3( after the initial 3(...), that's layer1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(, layer2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many 1+3( are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) => 1\n\n2. Inside that, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>2\n\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>3\n\n4. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>4\n\n5. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>5\n\n6. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>6\n\n7. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>7\n\n8. Then, 1+3(1+3(...)) =>8\n\n9. Then, 1+3(...)) =>9\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3, which doesn't have another 1+3(, so perhaps it's 8 layers.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that each layer adds another 1+3(, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3( appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3( instances.\n\nStarting from the first 1+3( after the initial 3(...), that's one.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(, that's two.\n\nContinuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1+3 without another 1+3(, so perhaps the number of 1+3( instances is 8.\n\nThus, the number of layers is 8, meaning that the innermost layer is layer8, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer8).\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to layer9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut if the number of layers is 8, then perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by writing down the entire expression and counting the layers.\n\nLet me write the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut now, I'm confused because when I count the number of 1+3( instances, I get 8, but when I compute, I get 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3(...) is the first layer, and then each 1+3( adds another layer.\n\nWait, no, the initial 3(...) is outside of the layers. The layers are the 1+3(...) inside.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether to count the initial 3(...) as a layer or not.\n\nIn the problem, the entire expression is 3*(layers), where layers are the nested 1+3(...).\n\nSo, the number of layers is the number of 1+3(...) inside.\n\nSo, let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears inside the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nEach time we have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer.\n\n2. Then, moving outward, it's 1+3*(1+3(...)) => second layer.\n\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3(...))) => third layer.\n\nContinuing until the outermost 1+3(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3(...) instances.\n\nEach time you have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, in the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each 1+3(...) adds a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3(...) instances.\n\nIn the expression, how many times does 1+3(...) appear?\n\nLet me count:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is one.\n\n- Then, moving outward, each time we have another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, in the expression, each time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))).\n\nThus, each 1+3( adds a new layer, so there are 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer is layer1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen, layer2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake because in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(layers), where layers are the 9 nested 1+3(...).\n\nSo, yes, the result is 88572.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check each step again:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 to make sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I've got it right.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start from the innermost part and work our way out. The innermost expression is (1+3). That seems straightforward enough. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is (1+3(4)). Wait, that's 1 plus 3 times 4. Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, that middle part becomes 13. \n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is (1+3(13)). Again, I'll compute the multiplication first: 3 times 13 is 39. Then add 1, which gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is (1+3(40)). Let's compute 3 times 40 first, which is 120, and then add 1 to get 121. So, that part becomes 121. \n\nNext, we have (1+3(121)). Calculating 3 times 121, which is 363, and then adding 1 gives me 364. So, that's 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's (1+3(364)). Let's compute 3 times 364. Hmm, 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 64 is 192, so adding those together gives me 1092. Then adding 1, that becomes 1093. \n\nContinuing, the next expression is (1+3(1093)). Calculating 3 times 1093: 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 93 is 279, so adding those gives me 3279. Then adding 1, that's 3280. \n\nNext layer is (1+3(3280)). Let's compute 3 times 3280. 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 280 is 840, so adding those together gives me 9840. Adding 1, that becomes 9841. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's (1+3(9841)). Calculating 3 times 9841: 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 841 is 2523, so adding those together gives me 29523. Then adding 1, that becomes 29524. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is (1+3(29524)). Let's compute 3 times 29524. 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9524 is... wait, let me compute that carefully. 9524 times 3: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 24 times 3 is 72. So, adding those together: 27000 + 1500 is 28500, plus 72 is 28572. So, 3 times 29524 is 88572. Then adding 1 gives me 88573. \n\nNow, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. But wait, the original problem is 3 times that expression. So, I need to compute 3 times 88573. Let me do that: 3 times 80000 is 240000, 3 times 8000 is 24000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 70 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. \n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because that seems a bit large. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3 times 88573 directly. Let's see: 88573 times 3. Starting from the right, 3 times 3 is 9, 3 times 7 is 21, carry over the 2, 3 times 5 is 15 plus 2 is 17, carry over the 1, 3 times 8 is 24 plus 1 is 25, carry over the 2, 3 times 8 is 24 plus 2 is 26. So writing that out, it's 265719. Yeah, that seems correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and after seven such operations, we ended up with 88573, which when multiplied by 3 gives the final result of 265719. \n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer was built upon the previous one, so by systematically simplifying each nested expression, I was able to reach the final answer without getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step worked well. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but it's always good to verify each step, especially the larger multiplications. \n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or use a formula, but since the expression is only nested eight times, it's manageable to compute each layer individually. If it were a much larger number of layers, I might look for a recursive formula or a geometric series approach, but in this case, step-by-step computation seems feasible.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expressions from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After simplifying each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost expression by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n    - 1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. Finally, multiply the outermost expression by 3:\n    - 3 \u00d7 88573 = 265719\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down and compute it first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, adding 1 gives 13. So, this layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving another layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me do that:\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39. Adding 1, we get 40. So, this layer is 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next step is:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, this layer simplifies to 121.\n\nI see a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me keep going step by step.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). That's 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). That's 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, this layer is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). That's 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, this layer is 9841.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have gone too far. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, each time we go out one layer, so step 1 is innermost, step 2 is next, up to step 9. So, I think I went up to step 9, which gives me 9841. But let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers.\n\nOriginal expression:\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is step 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n- Then, moving out, each additional (1 + 3(...) adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers because each opening parenthesis adds a new layer, and the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. So, step 1: innermost, step 2: next, up to step 9: outermost. So, my calculation up to step 9 is correct, giving me 9841.\n\nBut let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, actually, step 1 is (1+3), step 2 is 1+3*(step1), step3 is 1+3*(step2), and so on until step9. So, my steps are correct, and the final result after step9 is 9841.\n\nBut the original expression is 3 times that outermost layer, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses. So, after computing the outermost parentheses as 9841, the entire expression is 3*9841.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point I might have missed earlier. I thought I was computing up to the outermost layer, but actually, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, the outermost parentheses compute to 9841, and then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute 9841*3 directly.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nNow, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check with another method. Alternatively, I can compute 9841*3:\n\n9841\n*     3\n-------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nLet me go through each step again quickly:\n\nStep1: 1+3=4\n\nStep2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nStep3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nStep4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nStep5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nStep6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nStep7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nStep8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If you have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, it's a geometric series.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous, starting from 4.\n\nSo, if we denote the nth term as T(n), then T(n) = 1 + 3*T(n-1), with T(1) = 4.\n\nWe can compute T(2) = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nT(3)=1 + 3*13=40\n\nT(4)=1 + 3*40=121\n\nT(5)=1 + 3*121=364\n\nT(6)=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nT(7)=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nT(8)=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nT(9)=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(T(9)), but wait no, let's see.\n\nWait, no. The problem is 3*(T(8)), because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside. Wait, no, let me count again.\n\nWait, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is T(1)=4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers inside the 3* is 8, because the innermost is T(1)=4, then T(2)=13, T(3)=40,... up to T(9)=29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(T(9))?\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nThe structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, which is T(1)=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 3*(...), so:\n\n- The next layer is 1 + 3*T(1)=13=T(2)\n\n- Then, 1 + 3*T(2)=40=T(3)\n\n- Continuing until the outermost layer inside the 3* is T(9)=1 + 3*T(8)\n\nWait, but how many layers are there inside the 3*?\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions inside the 3*.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer\n\nThen, each additional (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), but the entire expression is 3*(...), so the outermost is 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer1.\n\nThen, each time we add another 3*(...), so the layers are:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1=13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2=40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3=121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4=364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5=1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6=3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7=9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8=29524\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, as before.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the outermost layer is Layer9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost layer was 9841, which would make the total 3*9841=29523.\n\nBut now I'm getting a different result because I'm considering how many layers are inside the 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions inside the 3*.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3*(1+3))\n\n3. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n\n...\n\nEach additional (1+3(...)) adds a new layer. So, in the original problem, how many (1+3(...)) are there?\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the number of (1+3(...)) expressions is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, the outermost is the 9th layer, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8)=1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost layer was 9841, which would make the total 3*9841=29523. So, which is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by not including the final 3* after the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3)=4 \u2192 Layer1\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(LayerN)).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3*(Layer9), where Layer9=1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nLayer8=1 + 3*(Layer7)\n\n...\n\nLayer1=4\n\nSo, Layer9=1 + 3*(Layer8)=1 + 3*(9841)=1 + 29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense because each layer is built upon the previous, and the outermost is Layer9, which is 29524, so 3 times that is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the outermost layer was 9841, but that's because I was counting up to Layer8, which is 9841, and then I forgot that the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again by counting the number of layers.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1=4\n\n2. (1 + 3*(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer2=13\n\n3. (1 + 3*(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3=40\n\n4. (1 + 3*(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4=121\n\n5. (1 + 3*(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5=364\n\n6. (1 + 3*(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6=1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7=3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8=9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9=29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that after computing Layer8=9841, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523, but that's incorrect because there's one more layer outside that.\n\nSo, to clarify, the number of layers is 9, each corresponding to the number of opening parentheses inside the 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example to see if my reasoning is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, innermost is (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nOutermost layer: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it step by step:\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nOutermost: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nThen, entire expression: 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, using the layer approach:\n\nLayer1=4\n\nLayer2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer3=1 + 3*13=40\n\nEntire expression=3*Layer3=120.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, applying this to the original problem, which has 9 layers inside the 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the outermost layer was Layer8=9841, leading to 3*9841=29523, but that's because I miscounted the layers. The correct count is 9 layers, leading to Layer9=29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that each layer is defined as T(n) = 1 + 3*T(n-1), with T(1)=4.\n\nSo, T(1)=4\n\nT(2)=1 + 3*4=13\n\nT(3)=1 + 3*13=40\n\nT(4)=1 + 3*40=121\n\nT(5)=1 + 3*121=364\n\nT(6)=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nT(7)=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nT(8)=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nT(9)=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*T(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are 9 layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of the outermost layer (Layer 9).\n\n4. **Final calculation**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, simplifying each layer as I go. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: the innermost parentheses is (1+3). So, that's 1 plus 3, which is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting the previous result, which was 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so substituting that in, it becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, this layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer would be (1 + 3*(previous result)), which is 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that layer is 121.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*121). Let's do the math: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, this simplifies to 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: (1 + 3*364). Calculating that: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\nNext, the next layer would be (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute that: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, that simplifies to 3280.\n\nContinuing outward: (1 + 3*3280). Calculating that: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, this layer is 9841.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let me see: 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, this simplifies to 29524.\n\nMoving out another layer: (1 + 3*29524). Calculating that: 3 times 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. So, this layer is 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute that: 3 times 88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. So, this simplifies to 265720.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check because I might have missed a layer. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count how many layers I've processed. Starting from the innermost, I did (1+3), then each subsequent layer up to the ninth. Let me recount: 1. (1+3)=4, 2. (1+3*4)=13, 3. (1+3*13)=40, 4. (1+3*40)=121, 5. (1+3*121)=364, 6. (1+3*364)=1093, 7. (1+3*1093)=3280, 8. (1+3*3280)=9841, 9. (1+3*9841)=29524, 10. (1+3*29524)=88573, 11. (1+3*88573)=265720. Hmm, so actually, there are nine layers, so after processing nine layers, I should have reached the outermost one. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times (1+3 occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)) until we have nine layers. So, when I started processing, I went through each layer step by step, from the innermost to the outermost. So, I think I processed nine layers, ending up with 265720, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me try to write down each step clearly, numbering each layer from 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3 * Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3 * Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3 * Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3 * Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3 * Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3 * Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3 * Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3 * Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so after processing nine layers, I get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this result, right? Because the outermost is 3*(...). So, after processing nine layers, we have Layer9 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*Layer9.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to Layer10 as 88573, but that might have been a miscount. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the number of layers. Let me clarify: The original expression is 3*(...), where the ... has nine layers of (1+3(...)). So, processing from innermost to outermost, I have nine layers, each being (1 + 3*previous). So, Layer1 is (1+3)=4, Layer2 is 1+3*4=13, up to Layer9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial processing, I went up to Layer11, which was 265720, but that's incorrect because the expression only has nine layers inside the outermost 3. So, I think I overcounted the layers earlier. Let me recount properly.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3) terms:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3*(1+3))\n3. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n4. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n5. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n6. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n7. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n8. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n9. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so the innermost is (1+3) and each layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So, there are nine layers in total inside the outermost 3. Therefore, processing each layer from 1 to 9, then multiplying by 3.\n\nSo, let me redo the layers correctly:\n\nLayer1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 265720, but that was incorrect because I had miscounted the layers. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7       3\n\n= ?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo,\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought I had 265,720, but that was when I miscounted the layers. So, to make sure, let me write down each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with n layers. In this case, n=9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nThis resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value after n layers. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, right side becomes 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers inside the outermost 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula. The formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), with nine layers, then it's equivalent to 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. By systematically solving each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and substitute it into the next layer until we reach the outermost expression. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each containing 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. The innermost part is the last \"1+3\" because that's the deepest nested part. So, starting from the inside, I can compute each layer one by one. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, the next step is:\n2. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n   - 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So:\n3. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is:\n4. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, I'm noticing that each time I compute a layer, the numbers are getting significantly larger. Let me keep going step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\n5. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Compute 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times the result from step 9:\n    - 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check each step because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems like each step checks out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might help me find a formula instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n where n is the depth, starting from the innermost, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be found by assuming a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a layer. The given expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3*(...))\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Wait, maybe it's easier to see that the expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, the given expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. ... and so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*( layer1 )\n\nwhere layer1 is 1 + 3*(layer2)\n\nlayer2 is 1 + 3*(layer3)\n\nlayer3 is 1 + 3*(layer4)\n\nand so on until layer9 is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a_n where n=1 to n=9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I considered a_1 as the innermost, which was (1+3)=4, and then a_2 as the next layer, etc., up to a_9. So, in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier step-by-step calculation where a_9 was 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute a_9 directly without going through each step, which is much faster and reduces the chance of error.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as having 9 layers, each contributing a factor of 3. But I think the formula approach is solid here.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me try computing a_4 using the formula:\n\na_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which matches my earlier step-by-step.\n\nGood, so the formula works. So, applying it to a_9 gives me 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of exponents. Let me see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4, and the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3(...)) layers, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, n=9, so a_9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire expression out, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, each time, we have a new layer of 1 + 3*(...). So, 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*something, and the something is another similar term. So, the whole expression is a geometric series in some way.\n\nWait, but maybe that's overcomplicating. I think the formula I have is sufficient.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\n1. The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\n2. Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\n3. The closed-form solution for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me check once more with the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\n3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049.\n\nSubtracting 1 gives 59048, dividing by 2 gives 29524.\n\nMultiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach aligns with the step-by-step calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively contributing a power of 3. So, starting from the innermost, each time you go out a layer, you're adding another factor of 3. But I think the formula approach is more straightforward here.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). \n\n1. **Innermost layer**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3 around it. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, the expression is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so I think there are nine layers in total because the innermost part is the ninth one. Wait, no, actually, when I look at the expression, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let me count them. \n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me see: each time I see a 3 followed by a (1+3... So maybe each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, so that suggests there are nine layers. Wait, no, actually, each time I have a 3(1+3(...)), so each layer is another 3(1+...). So perhaps there are eight layers because the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Hmm, maybe I should approach it step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. That might be the easiest way because each layer depends on the next one. So starting from the innermost part: 1+3. That's simple, 1+3 is 4. Then moving one layer out, we have 1+3(4). Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So that layer gives us 13. \n\nNext layer out: 1+3(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So now we have 40. Moving outward again: 1+3(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So that's 121. Next layer: 1+3(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, 364. \n\nContinuing outward: 1+3(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Then the next layer: 1+3(1093). Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then plus 1 is 3280. \n\nNext layer: 1+3(3280). 3*3280: Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. \n\nMoving outward again: 1+3(9841). 3*9841: Let me compute that. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000+2523=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. \n\nNext layer: 1+3(29524). 3*29524: Let's compute 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*524=1572. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1572=88572. Plus 1 is 88573. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 1+3(88573). Let's compute 3*88573: 3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*73=219. Adding those together: 240000+24000=264000, 264000+1500=265500, 265500+219=265719. Plus 1 is 265720. \n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So 3*265720. Let's compute that: 3*200000=600000, 3*60000=180000, 3*5000=15000, 3*720=2160. Adding those together: 600000+180000=780000, 780000+15000=795000, 795000+2160=797160. So the final result is 797,160.\n\nWait a second, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't miscalculate anywhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3=4.\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nNext: 1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nNext: 1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nNext: 1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nNext: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nNext: 1+3*29524=1+88572=88573.\n\nNext: 1+3*88573=1+265719=265720.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(265720)=797,160.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Maybe I didn't make a mistake. Let me try to think if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nWait, this expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. \n\nThis kind of recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(r^n - 1) + (a_0*r^{n+1})/(1 - r). Wait, but I think it's simpler because each term is built from the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, and there are 9 layers, maybe we can express the total as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1 (the innermost term before any multiplication). Wait, no, actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, so maybe a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=0, a_0=1 (the innermost 1+3 would be when n=0: a_0=1+3=4, but maybe I'm misdefining n here). Wait, perhaps I should index it differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we have nine layers, so the innermost is a_1=4, and the outermost is a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation where I ended up with 797,160. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers. So when I computed up to a_9=29524, that would be the value inside the outermost 3*(...). So the total would be 3*29524=88572, not 797,160. Wait, so my initial step-by-step computation was wrong because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let's see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1+3*(4)=13, that's layer 2.\n\nNext layer: 1+3*13=40, layer 3.\n\nNext: 1+3*40=121, layer4.\n\nNext: 1+3*121=364, layer5.\n\nNext: 1+3*364=1093, layer6.\n\nNext: 1+3*1093=3280, layer7.\n\nNext: 1+3*3280=9841, layer8.\n\nNext: 1+3*9841=29524, layer9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I went one layer too far, thinking there were ten layers, but actually, there are nine layers, so the outermost is 3*(layer9). So the correct answer should be 88,572, not 797,160.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? Let me recount the number of layers. The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So each time I see a 3*(1+3*(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*... parts.\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each time I see a 3*(1+3*... that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1+3*(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times the pattern 3*(1+3*... occurs. Let's see: starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is nested inside the previous one. So, the first 3 is at the outermost layer, then inside it is another 3, and so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does the 3*(1+3*... pattern occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, then inside, another 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, and so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a '(', that's a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. That means there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a new 3*(1+3*... So, the innermost is layer 9, which is 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer 8 is 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer7: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer6: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer4: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer3: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer2: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer1: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is layer1, which is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, in my initial calculation, I went one layer too far because I thought there were ten layers, but actually, there are nine, so the outermost layer is 29524, and the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so my initial step-by-step calculation was incorrect because I thought there were more layers than there actually are. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nLet me verify this again by counting the layers carefully. Each time I see a 3 followed by a '(', that's a new layer. So:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 this is layer1\n2. Inside layer1, we have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 layer2\n3. Inside layer2, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2013 layer3\n4. Inside layer3, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2013 layer4\n5. Inside layer4, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2013 layer5\n6. Inside layer5, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 layer6\n7. Inside layer6, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \u2013 layer7\n8. Inside layer7, 3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 layer8\n9. Inside layer8, 3(1+3))))))) \u2013 layer9\n\nWait, but in this counting, layer9 is 3*(1+3), which is 3*4=12, but that doesn't make sense because each layer is 1+3*(...). Hmm, perhaps my initial approach is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of the number of 3*(1+3*... terms. Let me count the number of times 3*(1+3* appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside the previous one. Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*... segments:\n\n1. The first 3*(1+3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3*(1+3*(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(1+3*... occur? Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by 1+3*(...), so that's one.\n- Inside that, another 3*(1+3*(...), that's two.\n- Continuing this way, each time I see a 3*(1+3*(..., that's a new layer.\n\nSo, counting them:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) \u2013 1\n2. Inside that: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))) \u2013 2\n3. Inside that: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))) \u2013 3\n4. Inside that: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))) \u2013 4\n5. Inside that: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))) \u2013 5\n6. Inside that: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))) \u2013 6\n7. Inside that: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))) \u2013 7\n8. Inside that: 3*(1+3*(1+3))))))) \u2013 8\n9. Inside that: 3*(1+3))))))) \u2013 9\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each corresponding to a 3*(1+3*... So, the innermost is layer9: 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer8: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer7: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer6: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer4: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer3: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer2: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer1: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(layer1)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think my initial mistake was miscounting the number of layers, leading me to compute one extra layer and thus arrive at an incorrect answer. After carefully recounting, I see that there are nine layers, so the final result is 88,572.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer9: 1+3=4\n\nLayer8: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer7: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer6: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer4: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer3: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer2: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer1: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've got it now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed and used in the next.

    "text": " \n\nSo, the expression is built up like this: starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 1+3 times the previous result. Let me try to write this out layer by layer. Maybe if I start from the inside and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle. \n\nLet me assign each layer a number to keep track of where I am. Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then the next one out is layer 2, and so on, up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time there's a 1+3, and then another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats. \n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1+3 times that. So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step. \n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So I need to compute Layer 9 first, then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*29524 = (3*20000) + (3*9000) + (3*500) + (3*24)\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\nNow, adding these together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1+3=4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. That's correct.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer, then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent is layer 2 up to layer 9. So, 9 layers in total. So, the expression is 3*(layer 9). So, my calculation of 88572 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If we have an expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1, then each layer can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1+3=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Since each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But in this case, since we have a fixed number of layers, the formula I derived earlier is more straightforward.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the value step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the ninth layer's value to be 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. The innermost part is the last term, which is $1+3$. That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, $1 + 3$ equals 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. Since we just found that the innermost part is 4, the next expression becomes $1 + 3 \\times 4$. Let me compute that. \n\nSo, 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives us 13. Got it. So now, that part simplifies to 13. Moving out another level, the next expression is again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where \"something\" is now 13. Let me compute that. So, 3 times 13 is 39, and then adding 1 gives me 40. Hmm, so that's 40. \n\nLet me keep going. The next level out is another $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where \"something\" is 40. Calculating that, 3 times 40 is 120, and adding 1 gives me 121. Okay, so now we're at 121. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the next expression is again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with \"something\" being 121. Let me do the math: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Each time, I'm taking the result from the innermost parentheses, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me verify the previous steps to ensure I haven't messed up. \n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That seems correct so far. \n\nProceeding further, the next expression is 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, now we're at 1093. \n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, that's 3280. \n\nContinuing, the next expression is 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, that's 9841. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 3280 times 3 is 9840, yes. Adding 1 gives 9841. Correct. \n\nMoving out another level, we have 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9841 is... Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that step by step. 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 is 29,523. Adding 1 gives us 29,524. \n\nSo, that level simplifies to 29,524. \n\nNow, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 3*29,524. Let me break it down. 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000, plus 1,500 is 88,500, plus 60 is 88,560, plus 12 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Adding 1 gives us 88,573. \n\nSo, now we're at 88,573. \n\nMoving out another level, the expression is 1 + 3*88,573. Let me compute that. 3*88,573. Hmm, let me break it down again. 80,000*3 is 240,000, 8,000*3 is 24,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000, plus 1,500 is 265,500, plus 210 is 265,710, plus 9 is 265,719. So, 3*88,573 is 265,719. Adding 1 gives us 265,720. \n\nSo, that's 265,720. \n\nNow, moving out to the next level, we have 1 + 3*265,720. Let me compute that. 3*265,720. Let me break it down: 200,000*3 is 600,000, 60,000*3 is 180,000, 5,000*3 is 15,000, 700*3 is 2,100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. So, 3*265,720 is 797,160. Adding 1 gives us 797,161. \n\nSo, that simplifies to 797,161. \n\nNow, moving out to the very outermost level, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which we've now simplified step by step to 3*797,161. \n\nLet me compute that. 797,161 times 3. Let me break it down: 700,000*3 is 2,100,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 7,000*3 is 21,000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000, plus 21,000 is 2,391,000, plus 300 is 2,391,300, plus 180 is 2,391,480, plus 3 is 2,391,483. \n\nSo, 3*797,161 equals 2,391,483. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483. \n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. I went through each step carefully, but it's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me verify a few key points. \n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. \n\nContinuing: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. \n\nNext, 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*797,161 = 2,391,483. \n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one without any discrepancies. So, I think my calculations are correct. \n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a more efficient way to compute this without having to manually compute each step. Maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series or something like that. Let me think about that. \n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3 terms. So, each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, and this repeats several times. Let me count how many times this happens. Let's see, starting from the innermost parentheses, each level adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. \n\nWait, let me count the number of 3s in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers. \n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, so that means there are 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. \n\nSo, in total, we have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost. So, the expression can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. And so on, up to a_9. \n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. \n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. \n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. \n\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence relation: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. \n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. \n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. \n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. \n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. \n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. \n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. \n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59,049. So, 59,049 minus 1 is 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Wait, but earlier, when I computed up to a_9, I got 29,524. So, that's consistent. \n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, right? Because the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. \n\nTherefore, the total value is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. \n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177,147. So, 177,147 minus 3 is 177,144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. But wait, that's not matching my earlier result. Wait, no, hold on. Because when I computed step by step, I ended up with 3*a_9 = 2,391,483. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the recurrence relation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers. But according to the recurrence, a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29,524. So, 3*a_9 is 3*29,524 = 88,572. But wait, that's not matching my step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 2,391,483. \n\nHmm, that suggests I have an error in my recurrence relation approach. Let me re-examine. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3(...). \n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. Let's count the number of layers. \n\nThe innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then, layer 2: 1+3*(layer 1). Layer 3: 1+3*(layer 2). Continuing up to layer 9: 1+3*(layer 8). So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). \n\nSo, a_1 = 1+3=4. a_2=1+3*a_1=13. a_3=1+3*a_2=40. a_4=1+3*a_3=121. a_5=1+3*a_4=364. a_6=1+3*a_5=1093. a_7=1+3*a_6=3280. a_8=1+3*a_7=9841. a_9=1+3*a_8=29,524. \n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. But wait, earlier, when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2,391,483. That's a discrepancy. So, one of these approaches must be wrong. \n\nWait, let me check my step-by-step computation again. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let's go back. \n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: \n\n1. The innermost is 1+3. \n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1+3*(1+3). \n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)). \n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another layer. \n\nLet me count the number of layers by the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: (1+3(1+3(...))). So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers. \n\nBut when I computed step by step, I ended up with a_9 = 29,524, and then 3*a_9 = 88,572. However, when I computed manually, I got 2,391,483. That suggests that perhaps I miscounted the layers or misapplied the formula. \n\nWait, let me recount the layers. Let's write the expression with indices: \n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 \n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \n\n... \n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) \n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). \n\nBut when I computed step by step, I went beyond 9 layers. Let me recount: \n\nStarting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4. \n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13. \n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40. \n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121. \n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364. \n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093. \n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. \n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. \n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29,524. \n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*29,524=88,572. \n\nBut in my initial step-by-step computation, I went beyond 9 layers, treating the outermost 3 as another layer, which is incorrect. The outermost 3 is just a multiplier, not another layer. So, I think I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step approach by considering the outermost 3 as part of the layers, leading to an incorrect total. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29,524, and then 3*29,524=88,572. \n\nBut when I computed manually, I treated the outermost 3 as another layer, leading to 3*29,524=88,572, but then continued further, which is incorrect. So, my initial step-by-step approach was flawed because I mistakenly included the outermost 3 as part of the layers, whereas it's just a multiplier after the 9 layers. \n\nTherefore, the correct value is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this with the recurrence relation. The general formula I derived was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59,049-1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. \n\nBut earlier, when I computed manually, I ended up with 2,391,483, which is much larger. So, clearly, I made a mistake in my manual computation by treating the outermost 3 as part of the layers, leading to an extra layer and thus an incorrect result. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572. \n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me recount my manual computation steps to see where I went wrong. \n\nI started with the innermost: 1+3=4. \n\nThen, moving out: 1+3*4=13. \n\nThen, 1+3*13=40. \n\nThen, 1+3*40=121. \n\nThen, 1+3*121=364. \n\nThen, 1+3*364=1093. \n\nThen, 1+3*1093=3280. \n\nThen, 1+3*3280=9841. \n\nThen, 1+3*9841=29,524. \n\nThen, moving out, I did 1+3*29,524=88,573. \n\nWait, but according to the original expression, that should be the end. Because after 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29,524=88,572. \n\nBut in my manual computation, I treated the outermost 3 as part of another layer, leading to an extra step: 1+3*29,524=88,573, which is incorrect because the outermost expression is just 3*(Layer 9), not another 1+3*(Layer 9). \n\nTherefore, my manual computation was wrong because I added an extra layer beyond the 9 layers. So, the correct computation is to stop at Layer 9 and then multiply by 3. \n\nTherefore, the correct value is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, let me check this again. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))). So, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). The inner part is 9 layers deep, so the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29,524. \n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29,524=88,572. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, earlier, when I computed manually, I went beyond Layer 9, treating the outermost 3 as another layer, leading to an incorrect result. So, I need to correct that. \n\nTherefore, the correct value is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, let me check the formula again. The general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, total expression is 3*a_9=88,572. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9). \n\nBut let me also consider that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, each layer adds a 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, earlier, when I computed manually, I ended up with 2,391,483. That suggests that perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count again. \n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: \n\n1. The innermost is 1+3. \n\nThen, moving out: \n\n2. 1+3*(1+3) \n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)) \n\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))) \n\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))) \n\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))) \n\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))) \n\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))) \n\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))) \n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). \n\nSo, that's 9 layers, as previously thought. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let me consider the expression as a sum. Each layer adds a term that is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me think of it as a geometric series. \n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as x_1 = 1 + 3. Then, x_2 = 1 + 3*x_1. x_3 = 1 + 3*x_2. And so on, up to x_9. Then, E = 3*x_9. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). \n\nBut perhaps another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, as I did before. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of terms where each term is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers it's nested within. \n\nWait, let me try that. Let me consider expanding the expression. \n\nStarting from the innermost: \n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me expand this step by step. \n\nFirst, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 121. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 364. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. \n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524. \n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, earlier, when I computed manually, I went beyond 9 layers, leading to a much larger number. So, I must have miscounted the layers. Let me confirm the number of layers again. \n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: \n\n1. (1+3(1+3(...))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis represents a new layer. So, from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers. \n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). \n\nThus, the correct computation is 3*29,524 = 88,572. \n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88,572. \n\nBut wait, let me just make sure by computing the layers again. \n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13 \n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40 \n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121 \n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364 \n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1093 \n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=3280 \n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=9841 \n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=29,524 \n\nThen, E=3*29,524=88,572. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By systematically simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing through all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me start by writing down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, I count nine sets of parentheses here. That means I need to start from the innermost one and work my way out. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3):\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, let's compute that:\n2. Compute (1 + 3*4):\n   - 3*4 = 12\n   - 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, that's the next layer out. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 2). Let's do that:\n3. Compute (1 + 3*13):\n   - 3*13 = 39\n   - 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing this process, each time I'm working from the inside out. So, next:\n4. Compute (1 + 3*40):\n   - 3*40 = 120\n   - 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, this seems to be growing quickly. Let me keep track of each step to avoid mistakes.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121)\n   - 3*121 = 363\n   - 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Then, (1 + 3*364)\n   - 3*364 = 1092\n   - 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next, (1 + 3*1093)\n   - 3*1093 = 3279\n   - 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Then, (1 + 3*3280)\n   - 3*3280 = 9840\n   - 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Finally, the last innermost layer before the outermost multiplication is (1 + 3*9841)\n   - 3*9841 = 29523\n   - 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, I should have nine layers to compute before multiplying by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, the final step is:\n\n10. Compute 3 * 29524\n    - 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's compute each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, actually, let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\nThere's a 2 at the start: 2 * 3 = 6 + 0 = 6 \u2192 6\n\nWait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify using another method. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the initial problem had nine layers or eight. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing one.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer. Let me count the number of times (1+3) appears:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I compute it step by step, I had 9 layers, so that's correct.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me try a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), that would be:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the original problem with nine layers would result in 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let me check.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\n=> A - 3A = 1\n\n=> -2A = 1\n\n=> A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each time computing the value of the current layer and substituting it into the next. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost value by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let me start from the inside and work my way outwards, step by step.\n\nAlright, the innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. That was easy. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, let me check: the next layer is (1 + 3*(inner result)). So, I just calculated the innermost part as 4, so now the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that layer gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, I have another (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is again (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 40, so 3*40 is 120, and then 1 + 120 is 121. Hmm, interesting, so this layer is 121.\n\nWait a second, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me list out the results I've got so far:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nI wonder if there's a formula or a sequence that these numbers are following. Let me think. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, if I denote each step as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Hmm, maybe this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nBut wait, maybe I don't need to overcomplicate it. Since the problem only has a finite number of layers, maybe I can just compute each step one by one until I reach the outermost layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are 9 layers in total. Wait, but when I started, I had 4, then 13, 40, 121... So, that's 4 layers so far. Let me continue computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, after 121, the next layer is (1 + 3*121). Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. Next layer: (1 + 3*364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Then, the next layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let's calculate that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Then, the next layer: (1 + 3*9841). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Now, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. Then, the entire original expression is 3 times that, so 3*88573. Let me compute that: 88573 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*80000 is 240000. Then, 3*8000 is 24000, which would be 240000 + 24000 = 264000. Then, 3*500 is 1500, so 264000 + 1500 = 265500. Next, 3*70 is 210, so 265500 + 210 = 265710. Then, 3*3 is 9, so 265710 + 9 = 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265,719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 3 is 9, write down 9.\n- 3 * 7 is 21, write down 1 and carry over 2.\n- 3 * 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1.\n- 3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, write down 5 and carry over 2.\n- 3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 2 is 26, write down 6 and carry over 2.\n- Now, since there are no more digits, we write down the carried 2.\n\nSo, putting it together: 265,719. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic. Let me compute 88573 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, so 1 and carryover 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, so 7 and carryover 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, so 5 and carryover 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, so 6 and carryover 2\n- Finally, carryover 2, so the total is 265,719.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 265,719.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps when computing each layer, let me go through each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on, I just realized that I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: \n\n- The first innermost is (1+3), which is 1.\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 10 steps, from 4 up to 88573. Let me check again:\n\nWait, when I started, the innermost was (1+3)=4, which is the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)), so the total number of layers is 9, meaning I should have 9 steps, each time adding a layer. But in my earlier calculation, I went up to 88573, which was the 9th step, right? Let me recount:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. (1+3*4) = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. (1+3*13) = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. (1+3*40) = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. (1+3*121) = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. Then, the outermost layer is (1+3*29524) = 88573 (Layer 10)\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers, not 9. That means I have 10 layers to compute. So, the initial innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 10. So, when I computed up to 29524, that was Layer 9, and then the outermost Layer 10 is (1 + 3*29524) = 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any layers. Let me count the number of times I see a (1+3(...)) in the original expression. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the left, the first innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each (1+3(...) starts a new layer. So, starting from the first (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each additional (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n- The first (1+3) is Layer 1.\n- Then, each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer, so how many times does (1+3) appear? Let me count the number of (1+3) inside each other.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1+3(...)), so that's one opening parenthesis.\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's two.\n- Continuing this way, each (1+3 adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of (1+3) terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a separate layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer outwards adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1+3) appears, which is 9 times. Wait, but in the expression, I see that after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the expression as:\n\n3 * [ (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * ... * (1 + 3) ... )) ) ]\n\nEach (1 + 3 * ... ) is a layer, and the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1 + 3) is nested. So, if I count the number of (1 + 3) terms, starting from the innermost, it's 9 times, because each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 adds a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me look at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the first opening parenthesis.\n- Then, each subsequent (1+3 adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then, inside, another ( after 1+3: 1+3(\n3. Then another ( inside that: 1+3(\n4. Continuing this way, each ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3: (\n2. Inside that: ( after 1+3\n3. Inside that: (\n4. Inside that: (\n5. Inside that: (\n6. Inside that: (\n7. Inside that: (\n8. Inside that: (\n9. Inside that: (\n10. Inside that: (1+3)))\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is (1+3), and each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9, I should have stopped at 29524, and then the outermost layer would be Layer 10, which is (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted the layers, I thought there were 10 layers, but now I'm confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the expression as a nested function where each layer is (1 + 3*previous). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3) = 4, then each layer outwards is 1 + 3*previous. Let me list the layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 10. Therefore, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*88573, which is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 10. Let me count the number of times I see a (1+3 in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 10 layers? Wait, perhaps it's better to see how many times the pattern repeats. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3) terms:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), that's 1.\n- Then, each subsequent (1+3 is another layer, so the next is (1+3(1+3)), that's 2.\n- Continuing, (1+3(1+3(1+3))) is 3 layers.\n\nSo, how many times does (1+3) appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me instead think that each (1+3) inside another (1+3) adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is the number of times (1+3) is nested inside another (1+3). Let me count the number of (1+3) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? Because each time I add another (1+3) inside another (1+3). So, the innermost is 1 layer, then each additional is another layer, so up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer 10, I got 88573, which would be the outermost layer. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning that the outermost layer is Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, let me recount:\n\nIf there are 9 layers, then:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nSo, the outermost Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 10 layers leading to 265,719. Now I'm confused. Let me try to clarify this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me take the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) terms, which correspond to the layers. Each (1+3) is a new layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first (1+3) is the innermost, that's Layer 1.\n- Then, each subsequent (1+3) is another layer. Let me count how many times (1+3) appears in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost Layer 9 is (1 + 3*Layer8). So, if I compute up to Layer 9, that's 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer 10, I had 88573, which would be the result of the outermost parentheses. But if there are only 9 layers, then the outermost parentheses would be Layer 9, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. But that contradicts my previous calculation where I had 10 layers leading to 265,719.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try another approach. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each ( after 3 is an opening parenthesis, which starts a new layer.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3: (\n2. Then, inside that, another ( after 1+3: (1+3(\n3. Inside that: another ( after 1+3: (1+3(\n4. Continuing this way, each ( after 1+3 is another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( inside adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then, inside, (1+3(\n3. Then, another (1+3(\n4. Another (1+3(\n5. Another (1+3(\n6. Another (1+3(\n7. Another (1+3(\n8. Another (1+3(\n9. Another (1+3(\n10. Another (1+3))\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses. So, that would mean there are 10 layers. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 10, which is (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265,719.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of (1+3) terms, I get 9, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, I get 10. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Let me write out the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. Each time, it's 3*(...), so the number of such multiplications is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 3). Then, each layer outwards is 3*(...). So, how many times does 3*(...) occur?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each layer adds a 3* term, so the number of layers is equal to the number of 3* operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nSo, the first operation is 3*(...), which is the outermost layer, and inside that, we have (1 + 3*(...)), which is the next layer, and so on, down to the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is the number of times we have 3*(...), which would be 9 times, since the innermost is just (1 + 3), without a 3* outside it. Wait, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each (1 + 3*(...)) as a layer, and the number of such layers is 9, because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to see that the expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n\nWait, let me try to compute it again, carefully counting the layers.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 10 layers leading to 265,719. Now I'm getting 9 layers leading to 88572. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me look at the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( (1 + 3*( ... (1 + 3) ... )) ) ) ) )\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*Layer_i), so up to Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses inside the initial 3*.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer 10, I had 88573, and then 3*88573 = 265,719. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see: if the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds one more, so if the original expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), then Layer 9 would be the outermost before the initial 3*. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I computed earlier, I went one layer further to Layer 10, which would be outside of the initial 3*, which isn't part of the expression. So, perhaps I made a mistake by going one layer too far.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again. It is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of (1+3) terms is 9, each nested inside another. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3*(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Therefore, the outermost Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 10 layers, which led to 265,719, which is much larger. That suggests that I may have miscounted the layers. Let me recount carefully.\n\nLet me list the layers with their corresponding results:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer 10, I had (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, which would be Layer 10, but that's outside the initial 3*(...). So, perhaps the initial 3* is not part of the layer count. Therefore, the correct total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. The initial 3 is outside the entire parentheses. So, the expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 29524. Therefore, the result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to 10 layers, I got 265,719, which would be 3*88573, but if Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier computation by including an extra layer. Let me confirm:\n\nThe original expression has 9 layers of (1+3*(...)), starting from the innermost. Therefore, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I computed earlier, I went one layer beyond that, which would be incorrect because the expression only has 9 layers. Therefore, the correct result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this by computing the expression with fewer layers to see the pattern.\n\nLet me compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's say we have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). That's three layers.\n\nCompute innermost: (1+3) = 4\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nEntire expression: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4)=13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13)=40\n\nEntire expression: 3*40=120.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, with 4 layers:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4)=13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13)=40\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40)=121\n\nEntire expression: 3*121=363.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with 9 layers, the result should be 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to 10 layers, I got 265,719, which is 3*88573. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier computation by adding an extra layer. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of (1+3) terms, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 10 layers, which led to 265,"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write this down more clearly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI count nine sets of parentheses, so there are nine layers here. That means I'll need to start from the innermost one and work my way out, solving each part step by step. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, it's Layer 2, up to Layer 9.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 plus 3 is 4. So Layer 1 simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 plus 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1, we get 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that. 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 64 is 192, so adding those gives 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Hmm, 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 93 is 279, so adding those gives 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's calculate that. 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 41 is 123. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me check that again. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000+2400=29400, plus 123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, 88572 is a pretty big number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern, which might save time and reduce errors.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find D, we can set the recurrence equal when n approaches infinity, but since our case is finite, maybe it's better to compute the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nWait, but in our case, n starts at 1, and we have 9 layers. So perhaps it's better to compute a_n step by step, which is what I did earlier, leading to a_9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as a geometric series. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say D. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous. So, the outermost layer is a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, because n=9, so 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much faster and reduces the chance of error.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. Each layer follows the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, leading to the general solution a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this for n=9 gives the innermost value, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. \n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). So, substituting the 4 we just got, it becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. \n\nSo, the next level out is 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. \n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check that. If the innermost is 4, then the next level is 1 + 3*4 = 13, right? Then the next one would be 1 + 3*13, which is indeed 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, maybe it's correct. Let's continue.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*40. So, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. \n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, yes, plus 1 is 121. That seems correct. \n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. \n\nNext, 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. \n\nHmm, 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Yes, correct. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. \n\nNext level: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, correct. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. \n\nNext, moving outward: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Wait, no, 3280 is 3000 + 280. So, 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. \n\nWait, let me make sure: 3280 * 3. Let's compute 3200*3=9600, and 80*3=240. So, 9600 + 240 is 9840, yes. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. \n\nNext level: 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. \n\nWait, let me verify 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. \n\nWait, let me check 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute 29524*3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Then, 1 + 88,572 = 88,573. That seems correct. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*88,573. Let me compute that. 3*88,573: 80,000*3=240,000, 8,000*3=24,000, 500*3=1,500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Then, 1 + 265,719 = 265,720. \n\nWait, let me verify 88,573*3: 88,573 * 3. 80,000*3=240,000, 8,000*3=24,000, 500*3=1,500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Then, 1 + 265,719 is 265,720. Correct. \n\nNow, moving outward again: 1 + 3*265,720. Let's compute that. 3*265,720: 200,000*3=600,000, 60,000*3=180,000, 5,000*3=15,000, 700*3=2,100, 20*3=60. So, adding them up: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. Then, 1 + 797,160 = 797,161. \n\nWait, let me check 265,720*3: 265,720*3. 200,000*3=600,000, 60,000*3=180,000, 5,000*3=15,000, 700*3=2,100, 20*3=60. So, 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. Then, 1 + 797,160 is 797,161. Correct. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*797,161. Let me compute that. 3*797,161: 700,000*3=2,100,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 7,000*3=21,000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483. Then, 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484. \n\nWait, let me check 797,161*3: 797,161*3. 700,000*3=2,100,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 7,000*3=21,000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483. Then, 1 + 2,391,483 is 2,391,484. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*2,391,484. Let me compute that. 3*2,391,484: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 300,000*3=900,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 1,000*3=3,000, 400*3=1,200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000; 6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000; 7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000; 7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200; 7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440; 7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452. Then, 1 + 7,174,452 = 7,174,453. \n\nWait, let me verify 2,391,484*3: 2,391,484*3. 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 300,000*3=900,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 1,000*3=3,000, 400*3=1,200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000; 6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000; 7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000; 7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200; 7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440; 7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452. Then, 1 + 7,174,452 is 7,174,453. Correct. \n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this outermost result. So, the final step is to compute 3*7,174,453. Let me do that. 7,000,000*3=21,000,000, 174,453*3. Let me compute 174,453*3. 100,000*3=300,000, 70,000*3=210,000, 4,000*3=12,000, 400*3=1,200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9. So, 300,000 + 210,000 = 510,000; 510,000 + 12,000 = 522,000; 522,000 + 1,200 = 523,200; 523,200 + 150 = 523,350; 523,350 + 9 = 523,359. \n\nWait, let me check 174,453*3: 174,453*3. 100,000*3=300,000, 70,000*3=210,000, 4,000*3=12,000, 400*3=1,200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9. So, 300,000 + 210,000 = 510,000; 510,000 + 12,000 = 522,000; 522,000 + 1,200 = 523,200; 523,200 + 150 = 523,350; 523,350 + 9 = 523,359. So, 7,000,000*3=21,000,000, plus 174,453*3=523,359. So, total is 21,000,000 + 523,359 = 21,523,359. \n\nWait, let me verify that addition: 21,000,000 + 523,359. 21,000,000 + 500,000 = 21,500,000; 21,500,000 + 23,359 = 21,523,359. Correct. So, 3*7,174,453 is 21,523,359. \n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved computing the inner expression, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that result in the next outer expression. After computing all the layers, the final result is 21,523,359. \n\nWait a minute, let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to miscount with such large numbers. Let me recount the steps:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. Next: 1 + 3*797161 = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484\n14. Next: 1 + 3*2391484 = 1 + 7174452 = 7174453\n15. Finally: 3*7174453 = 21523359\n\nWait, hold on, in my initial calculation, I had 14 steps, but now I'm recounting and it's 14 layers? Let me check the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nLet me see, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does this pattern repeat? The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost layer. Let's see how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3*(...) appears. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So, in total, when I computed up to Layer 9, which was 7,174,453, and then multiplied by 3 to get 21,523,359. \n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 14 steps, but actually, there are only 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of steps. Let me recount:\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that's only 9 layers, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 14 steps, which suggests I might have miscounted. Let me see. Maybe I included the multiplication by 3 at the end as a step, but actually, the final step is multiplying the 9th layer by 3. So, perhaps I had 9 layers inside, and then one final multiplication by 3, making it 10 steps? Let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the computation would be:\n\nCompute Layer 1 to Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3. So, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 9, which was 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, then added 1 to get 88573, and so on, up to Layer 14, which seems incorrect because there are only 9 layers. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to recount the layers properly. Let me write down the expression again:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, according to this, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 21,523,359, which is much larger. So, clearly, I made a mistake in my initial calculation by miscalculating the number of layers. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nEach time, we have a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3*(...)\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent \"1 + 3*(...)\" adds another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2013 Layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(Layer1)) \u2013 Layer 2\n3. (1 + 3*(Layer2)) \u2013 Layer 3\n4. (1 + 3*(Layer3)) \u2013 Layer 4\n5. (1 + 3*(Layer4)) \u2013 Layer 5\n6. (1 + 3*(Layer5)) \u2013 Layer 6\n7. (1 + 3*(Layer6)) \u2013 Layer 7\n8. (1 + 3*(Layer7)) \u2013 Layer 8\n9. (1 + 3*(Layer8)) \u2013 Layer 9\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So, in total, we compute up to Layer9, then multiply by 3. \n\nTherefore, my initial calculation went wrong because I continued computing beyond Layer9, which isn't necessary. Let me correct this.\n\nSo, starting over:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's much smaller than my initial 21 million. So, clearly, I miscounted the layers earlier, leading to an incorrect result. So, the correct approach is to compute up to Layer9, then multiply by 3, resulting in 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me compute Layer9 again:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was in counting the number of layers, leading to an incorrect result. The correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first started, I thought there were more layers, but now I see that there are only 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). Let me confirm by writing the expression with each layer:\n\nExpression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4 \u2013 Layer1\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n(1 + 3*4) = 13 \u2013 Layer2\n\n(1 + 3*13) = 40 \u2013 Layer3\n\n(1 + 3*40) = 121 \u2013 Layer4\n\n(1 + 3*121) = 364 \u2013 Layer5\n\n(1 + 3*364) = 1093 \u2013 Layer6\n\n(1 + 3*1093) = 3280 \u2013 Layer7\n\n(1 + 3*3280) = 9841 \u2013 Layer8\n\n(1 + 3*9841) = 29524 \u2013 Layer9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial calculation was wrong because I continued beyond Layer9, which isn't part of the original expression. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me compute Layer9 again:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8:"

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses indicate that we should solve what's inside them first before moving outward.\n\nAlright, so let me start by identifying the innermost part of this expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). That seems straightforward enough. So, let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace that part with 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be the one just outside the first one. Let me see, the next expression is (1 + 3( ... )). Wait, actually, the structure is a bit more nested. Let me try to parse this properly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better if I write down the structure so I can visualize it better. The entire expression is 3 times a big parentheses, which itself contains 1 plus 3 times another parentheses, and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the problem, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next parentheses. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each step adds another 3 times a parentheses. Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then each step out adds a layer, so how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean there are nine layers, right? Let me check:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The next layer is 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, up to nine times.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at it, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, let's see: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is built upon that.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me assign a variable to each layer to make it easier. Let's say that each layer is a term that we can compute step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me check. If Layer 2 is 13, then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13, which is 1 + 39, which is 40. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step until I reach the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but let me check: how many layers are there? The problem has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would be nine layers. Let me confirm that by counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, the first layer after 3( is (1 + 3(...)), then inside that is another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the ninth layer, which is the innermost (1 + 3). So, that's nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I thought that each layer is built upon the previous, starting from Layer 1 as (1 + 3), then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*Layer1, etc., up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's nine layers, right? Because each time I'm moving one layer out, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but let me count again. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving outward, so starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so perhaps the initial computation is 3 times Layer9, where Layer9 is the result of the nine layers inside.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, so then the total expression is 3*29524, which would be 88572. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check my steps again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nWait, let's go through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The problem has nine layers, right? Because each time the expression is 1 + 3*(...), and we have nine such instances.\n\nWait, but when I look at the problem again, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer1, and each step out adds another layer up to Layer9, which is the one just inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nSo, yes, Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check if I made any multiplication errors.\n\nLet me recalculate each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524, which is:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times (1 + 3( occurs in the problem.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, each (1+3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n\nWait, that's nine times, right? So, each (1+3( is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is the ninth (1+3), so Layer1 is the innermost, Layer2 is the next, up to Layer9 being the one just inside the initial 3(...)).\n\nSo, yes, I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think: each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nSo, in general, for each layer n, it's 1 + 3*layer(n-1).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this.\n\nLet me see: the recurrence is layer(n) = 1 + 3*layer(n-1), with layer(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is layer(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition: layer(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's compute layer(2) using the recurrence: layer(2) = 1 + 3*layer(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution: layer(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nLet me check this with layer(1):\n\nlayer(1) = (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nlayer(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nlayer(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer(n), it's (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, layer(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049, right?\n\nYes, because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, layer(9) is (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this problem, perhaps by recognizing it as a geometric series or using another mathematical approach, but I think the step-by-step method I used is solid, and the formula derived using the recurrence relation confirms the result.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, moving outward.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a formula using the recurrence relation to find the value of the outermost layer.\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough, and I didn't spot any errors in the calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +72=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...).

Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 1\n\nThen, each layer adds another \"1+3(\":\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" after the initial one adds a layer, and there are 8 more \"1+3(\" after the first one, making it 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9, that was 9 layers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" expressions.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1+3(\" is another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see: the expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3(...). So, each set is a new layer, making it 9 layers in total.\n\nYes, so my computation from L1 to L9 is correct, leading to L9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, all these steps are correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " That sounds manageable.\n\nAlright, let me write down the expression to visualize it better. So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next level would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that middle part simplifies to 13.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the original problem, after each inner expression, there's another 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe I need to work my way out step by step, each time replacing the innermost parentheses with its computed value and then moving outward. Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then, the next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until I get to the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but looking at the problem again, how many layers are there? Let me count. Starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each time moving outward, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and I can see that there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning that there are 9 layers of nesting. Wait, actually, let me check: Each time I add another layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each time moving out adds another layer. Let me count the number of times I see (1+3(...)): There's one after another, each time adding another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3*(...). Wait, but when I look at the problem, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers, each being 1+3*(...). So, that means I have to compute from the innermost to the outermost, each time solving the innermost parentheses first.\n\nLet me try to list each step methodically. Let's define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me assign variables to each layer for clarity. Let me say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, but hold on, I'm noticing that each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, no, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). So, the innermost is (1+3), which is L1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*L1, which is L2. Then, the next is 1 + 3*L2 = L3, and so on, until L9, which would be the outermost layer inside the initial 3*(...). So, after computing L9, the entire expression would be 3*(L9). Therefore, I need to compute L1 through L9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me count the number of layers again. Let me write out the expression step by step:\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 L1\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 L2\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 L3\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 L4\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 L5\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 L6\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 L7\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 L8\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 L9\n\nWait, so L9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.

Let's compute 1093 \u00d7 3: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9 \u2192 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 \u00d7 3: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 \u00d7 3: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check each step again, because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3\u00d7364. Let me compute 364 \u00d7 3: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. 1093 \u00d73: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. 3280\u00d73: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. 9841\u00d73: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can think of another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something like that. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis looks similar to a recurrence relation, where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me test this. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nSubstituting the assumed form:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result again.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is a nested expression with 9 layers, each adding 1 and multiplying by 3, the closed-form approach gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\).\n\n1.

Let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, let me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3(...), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3(...), then that's multiplied by 3, and added to 1, and so on. Let me count the number of layers here. The innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. Continue this until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me see: each \"1+\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, it's like a chain of 9 layers.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as having 9 sets of parentheses, each containing 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each step.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost, and S9 is the outermost. Wait, but actually, since we're starting from the innermost, maybe S1 is the innermost, S2 is the next one out, etc., up to S9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until we have 9 layers. So, let me compute each step:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount how many times we have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nLooking at the original expression: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's see how many layers there are:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 \u2192 S1\n2. 1 + 3*(S1) \u2192 S2\n3. 1 + 3*(S2) \u2192 S3\n4. 1 + 3*(S3) \u2192 S4\n5. 1 + 3*(S4) \u2192 S5\n6. 1 + 3*(S5) \u2192 S6\n7. 1 + 3*(S6) \u2192 S7\n8. 1 + 3*(S7) \u2192 S8\n9. 1 + 3*(S8) \u2192 S9\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times \"1 + 3*(...)\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each time we have another layer. So, how many layers?\n\nLet me see: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go one layer out, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, there are 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 \u2192 layer 1\n2. 1 + 3*(layer 1) \u2192 layer 2\n3. 1 + 3*(layer 2) \u2192 layer 3\n...\nUp to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression after the first 3 is:\n\n(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1 opening parenthesis\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 2 opening parentheses\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 3 opening parentheses\n...\nContinuing until there are 9 opening parentheses.\n\nWait, no, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" adds one more opening parenthesis, so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds one more opening parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), which is 1 opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is 2 opening parentheses.\n\nWait, no, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" adds one opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the entire expression after the first 3.\n\nThe expression after the first 3 is:\n\n(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds one opening parenthesis. Let me count how many opening parentheses there are after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is followed by an opening parenthesis. So, the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of layers. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer after the initial 3 is (1 + 3), which is one opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another opening parenthesis. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach time we have a \"(\", so let's see:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) \u2192 2\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) \u2192 3\n4. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) \u2192 4\n5. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) \u2192 5\n6. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) \u2192 6\n7. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) \u2192 7\n8. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) \u2192 8\n9. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 9\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning there are 9 layers. Therefore, I need to compute S1 through S9, where each S is 1 + 3*(previous S).\n\nWait, but earlier when I started computing S1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then S2 as 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to S9. But when I did that, I got S9 as 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*S9, which would be 3*29524 = 88572. But let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(S9), where S9 is the result of the innermost expression. Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(S9). So, if S9 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that I computed each S correctly. Let me go step by step again:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, S9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, yes, it's 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers, let me recount how many layers there are in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so starting from the first \"(\", each subsequent \"1+\" adds another \"(\". Let me count the number of \"(\" after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3 \u2192 1\n2. (1 + 3( \u2192 2\n3. (1 + 3( \u2192 3\n4. (1 + 3( \u2192 4\n5. (1 + 3( \u2192 5\n6. (1 + 3( \u2192 6\n7. (1 + 3( \u2192 7\n8. (1 + 3( \u2192 8\n9. (1 + 3( \u2192 9\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, so the first \"1+\" after the initial 3 is (1 + 3), which is one layer. Then each subsequent \"1+\" adds another layer. So, in total, there are 9 layers, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I'm not missing a layer. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is followed by another \"1+\", etc. Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms:\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so the number of \"1+\" terms is equal to the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, my computation of S1 through S9 is correct, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute each step again:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and I've verified the multiplication at the end. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. The innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be 1 plus 3 times that result. So, the next layer is (1 + 3*(inner result)). Since we just found the inner result is 4, let's substitute that in. \n\nSo, the next layer becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives us 13. Alright, so now that layer simplifies to 13. Moving another level out, the next expression is again 1 plus 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, substituting that in, we have 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives us 40. So, that layer becomes 40.\n\nHmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and then moving to the next layer. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me check how many layers I have. The original expression is 3 times a big parenthesis, which itself contains 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on, nine times. So, from the innermost (1+3) up to the ninth layer, each step adds one more layer. So, actually, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, I think I've done nine layers correctly, ending up with 29524, and then the outermost 3 times that. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, when I started with (1+3), that's the first innermost, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, I did 9 layers, each time computing the next outer layer. So, after 9 layers, I end up with 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 times 29524: Let's break it down. 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 3*29524 is 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Let's add those together.\n\n60000 + 27000 is 87000. 87000 + 1500 is 88500. 88500 + 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Let me go through each layer again.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer builds on the previous one correctly. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula that applies here. Let's see.\n\nThe expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, starting from the innermost part. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you go one layer out, you're effectively adding another term in a geometric progression. So, starting from the innermost, each step you go out multiplies the previous term by 3 and adds 1. So, it's like a sum of a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with each term also being added by 1.\n\nBut I think the recurrence relation method was the most efficient here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully working through each layer step by step and verifying using a recurrence relation, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost parentheses. By systematically simplifying each layer from the inside out, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the final result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses are the last one: (1+3). That's straightforward. So, let me compute that first. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses would be (1 + 3( result from above )). Let me write that down:\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4). Wait, 3*(4) is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nHmm, so the next step gives me 13. Let me keep going outward, replacing each innermost parentheses with its computed value.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check. 3 times 13 is indeed 39, and adding 1 gives 40. Yeah, that's correct.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large, but I think it's correct. Let me confirm: 121*3 is 363, add 1, yes, 364.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(364). Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nHmm, 1093? That seems quite big, but I think it's correct. Let me verify: 364*3 is indeed 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nWait, that's a big number. Let me check again: 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Yep, that's correct.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nWow, 9841. That's a pretty large number. Let me just confirm: 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Yep, that's correct.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, 9841*3: Let me do it more carefully. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524). Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify: 29524*3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- 29524\n- Multiply by 3:\n  - 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n  - 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n  - 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n  - 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n  - 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n  - The leading 2*3 = 6, write down 6.\nSo, putting it all together: 6, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because when I do it digit by digit:\n\nWait, let's do it more carefully:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4*3=12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8, carryover 0.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2*3=6. Write 6.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, then using that result in the next outer parentheses. Finally, after computing all the innermost expressions, the outermost part is 3 times the last computed value, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any steps. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to the ninth level.\n\nWait, actually, when I started, I computed (1+3) as step 1, then the next one as step 2, so that's 9 steps in total. Wait, but in my earlier counting, I went up to step 10, which was the outermost multiplication by 3. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first step. Then each subsequent step adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each adding another (1+3(...)). So, each step I did earlier corresponds to each layer. So, starting with step 1 as (1+3)=4, then step 2 as 1 + 3*4=13, step 3 as 1 + 3*13=40, step 4 as 1 + 3*40=121, step 5 as 1 + 3*121=364, step 6 as 1 + 3*364=1093, step 7 as 1 + 3*1093=3280, step 8 as 1 + 3*3280=9841, step 9 as 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute this using another method or verify with a different approach. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier after computing step by step. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute this using a different approach or check my work another way. Let me try computing the expression using the formula I derived.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524*3 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, let me check that:\n\n29524 = 30000 - 476.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that works too.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using both iterative computation and a formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each time we're adding another layer, which effectively is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, after each layer, the value is transformed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent a_n grows exponentially because of the multiplication by 3 each time. This is why the numbers get so large so quickly.\n\nIt's interesting because even though there are only nine layers, the numbers involved become quite substantial. It's a good example of how exponential growth can lead to very large numbers in relatively few steps.\n\nIn summary, by carefully breaking down the problem, computing each layer step by step, verifying with a formula, and cross-checking the computations, I arrived at the solution. It's a bit tedious, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth one, we find the value 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write this out to visualize it better. The innermost part is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, starting from the inside, it's like 1 + 3*(something), and that something is another 1 + 3*(another something), and so on, until we get all the way to the outermost parentheses. \n\nSince there are multiple layers, maybe it's best to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is another layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a layer. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, there's a 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...): starting from the first 3, then each inner 3 is another layer. So, how many 3*(1 + ... ) are there? Let me see: the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), then inside that, there's another 3*(1 + ...), and so on. So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the 9th layer from the outside? Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently. Let me consider that each time we have a 3*(1 + ...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ...) appears. Let me count from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3. That's layer 1. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer 1). That's layer 2. Then, layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(layer 9). Wait, so actually, there are 9 layers in total. Let me verify that.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer is 3*(...).\n\nSo, let's count how many times 1 + 3*(... occurs. Each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1 + 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3: that's layer 1.\n- Then, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1)\n- Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*(layer 8)\n- Then, the outermost is 3*(layer 9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is 3 times that. So, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8), and so on.\n\nSo, to compute this, I need to compute layer 1, then layer 2 using layer 1, up to layer 9, and then multiply by 3. That sounds manageable. Let's start.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: Let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000. Wait, no, wait: 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3:\n\n1000 * 3 = 3000\n\n93 * 3 = 279\n\nSo, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3:\n\n3000 * 3 = 9000\n\n280 * 3 = 840\n\nSo, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nSo, adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3 * 29,524.\n\nAs above, 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. I thought there were 9 layers, but let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, which is the first layer. Then, moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers is that? Let's see:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n- Then, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation of L1 to L9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, the outermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\nStart innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, I can be confident that applying the same method to the larger problem will give the correct result.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\\[\n3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " That sounds manageable.\n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying how many layers there are. I count nine sets of parentheses, each with a 1 plus 3 times another set. So, it's like a chain that starts from the innermost part and works its way out. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outward. That should make the problem more approachable.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, this layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer becomes 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, now we have 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let me do the multiplication first: 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives us 364. So, that's 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate that: 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute this: 3*3280 is 9840, and adding 1 gives 9841. So, now we have 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Let me do the multiplication: 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. So, this layer simplifies to 29524.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, and adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times the result we just got. So, 3*88573. Let me calculate that: 88573 multiplied by 3. Hmm, let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 80,000 * 3 is 240,000.\nThen, 8,000 * 3 is 24,000.\nNext, 500 * 3 is 1,500.\nThen, 70 * 3 is 210.\nFinally, 3 * 3 is 9.\nAdding all those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500. 265,500 + 210 is 265,710. 265,710 + 9 is 265,719.\n\nWait a second, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the multiplication because I think I might have made a mistake. 88,573 times 3: let's do it digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n3 * 3 is 9.\n3 * 7 is 21, carry over the 2.\n3 * 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, carry over the 1.\n3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, carry over the 2.\n3 * 8 is 24, plus the carried 2 is 26.\n\nSo, writing it down from the top:\nStarting from the right: 9, then 1 (from 21), then 7 (from 17), then 5 (from 25), then 6 (from 26). So, the result is 265,719. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, maybe I didn't make a mistake after all. But let me check again with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 88,573 * 3 can be broken down as (80,000 + 8,000 + 500 + 70 + 3) * 3. So, 80,000*3=240,000, 8,000*3=24,000, 500*3=1,500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I thought I might have made a mistake, but it seems consistent. So, perhaps 265,719 is the correct result.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 88,573 * 3 another way. Let's compute 88,573 * 2 first, which is 177,146, and then add 88,573 to that. So, 177,146 + 88,573.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n177,146\n+88,573\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n6 + 3 = 9\n4 + 7 = 11, carry over 1\n1 + 5 + 1 (carry) = 7\n7 + 8 = 15, carry over 1\n1 + 8 + 1 (carry) = 10\nSo, writing it down: 10 (from the ten thousands place), 5 (from the thousands), 7 (from the hundreds), 1 (from the tens), 9 (from the ones). So, 265,719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nOkay, so 3 times 88,573 is indeed 265,719. So, that's the final result. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier layers, let me quickly recap each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265,719\n\nYes, that all checks out. Each step seems correct, so I think the final answer is indeed 265,719. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4.

Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Next layer:\n    \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\]\n\n11. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 88573 = 265719 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from the innermost part)). Wait, let me write that down to keep track.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2))\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, I think the way to approach this is to compute each level step by step, starting from Level 1 and moving outward to Level 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the result of Level 9. \n\nLet me write down each level and compute it step by step.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9. So, I need to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3 * 29524. \n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, that might not be the best way to break it down. Alternatively, I can just multiply 29524 by 3 directly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = \n\nLet's add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check my levels again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Sometimes when doing multiple steps, it's easy to have an off-by-one error or a miscalculation.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each level is correct, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each level step by step. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the levels:\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each level seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check:\n\nLevel 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13, yes.\n\nLevel 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40, yes.\n\nLevel 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121, yes.\n\nSo, the general formula for each level is Level n = 3*Level (n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Level n, which could help in computing it without going through each step. But since n here is only 9, it's manageable step by step, but perhaps it's good to know the general approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Level n = 3*Level (n-1) + 1, with Level 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Level n - 3*Level (n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Level n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Level n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition Level 1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, Level n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Level n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nLevel 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\nYes, the formula works.\n\nSo, Level 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, Level 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here. The problem is that the expression is 3*(Level 9), but Level 9 is defined as (1 + 3*(Level 8)). So, the formula for Level n is correct, and then the total expression is 3*Level 9.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find a formula for the entire expression, which is 3*Level 9, then substituting Level 9:\n\nTotal expression = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, another way to compute the total expression is to recognize that it's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nBut since the problem is only 9 levels deep, the step-by-step approach was manageable. However, knowing the general formula could be helpful for similar problems with more levels.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value step by step and verify it using a closed-form formula. The final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms with a repeating pattern, which can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. Using the recurrence relation, each level n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the given problem with 9 levels, the innermost level is 4, and each subsequent level is computed until the 9th level, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That seems like a good strategy because each inner part is self-contained, and once I solve that, I can move outward.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute each step one by one.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))))))\n\nWait, let me correct that. Actually, each innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, but then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So perhaps I should compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a step. Let's number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine layers because the innermost is the ninth layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9 result)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 1, which is the outermost.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is Layer 1. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1 result). So, if Layer 1 is 29524, then the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which we've computed up to Layer 1 as 29524. So, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote the value of each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1. Wait, actually, earlier I numbered the innermost as Layer 9, but maybe it's better to number them starting from the innermost as n=1 and moving outward as n increases. Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define a recurrence relation. Let me let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, for n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, for n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to n=9, since there are nine layers.\n\nSo, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 1.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, if I expand it, starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nWait, but I think the approach I took with the recurrence relation is sufficient and accurate. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to compute the result without step-by-step computation.\n\n4. Verify the result using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, yeah, that's how I would approach this problem. It took a bit of time, but breaking it down layer by layer and then looking for a pattern or a formula helped me understand and solve it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we determine that the value of the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(next inner expression). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9 (outermost): 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer result by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Calculating that, 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nAlright, so now I've simplified two layers. Let me keep track of each step so I don't get confused. So far, I have:\n\n- Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n- Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next part is again 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 3*13 is indeed 39, and 39 plus 1 is 40. Yep, that's correct. So, moving on, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, and adding 1 gives me 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). Hmm, 3 times 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. So, that's 364.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let's see, 3 times 364 is... Well, 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 64 is 192, so adding those together gives 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that: 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 93 is 279, so adding those together, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate 3 times 3280. Well, 3 times 3000 is 9000, and 3 times 280 is 840, so adding those together gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nContinuing outward, the next part is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me figure this out: 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 841 is 2523, so adding those together, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3 times 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because that's a big number. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3. 29524 times 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carry over 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems complicated, but I think the first calculation was correct: 29524*3 is 88572, so adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nOkay, so moving out another layer, the next part is 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute that: 3 times 88573. Let me break it down. 3 times 80000 is 240000, 3 times 8000 is 24000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 70 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. So, that's 265720.\n\nWait, let me verify that again because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 88573 * 3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it step by step:\n\n88573 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n3*3 = 9\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\nWait, but there's no digit beyond the 8, so we just add the carry over 2 at the beginning. So, the result is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. That matches my previous calculation, so I think that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 3 times 265720. Well, 3 times 200000 is 600000, 3 times 60000 is 180000, 3 times 5000 is 15000, 3 times 700 is 2100, 3 times 20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161. So, that's 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Alternatively, 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next part is 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute that: 3 times 797161. Hmm, this is getting really big. Let me break it down: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000; 2370000 + 21000 = 2391000; 2391000 + 300 = 2391300; 2391300 + 180 = 2391480; 2391480 + 3 = 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives me 2391484. So, that's 2391484.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Alternatively, I can compute 797161 * 3:\n\n797161 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n1*3 = 3\n6*3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n1*3 = 3 + 1 = 4\n7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7*3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carry over 2\n9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7*3 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carry over 2\nSo, putting it all together: 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, it's 3*(2391484). Let me compute that. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000; 6900000 + 270000 = 7170000; 7170000 + 3000 = 7203000; 7203000 + 1200 = 7204200; 7204200 + 240 = 7204440; 7204440 + 12 = 7204452.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I might have missed a step. Alternatively, 2391484 * 3:\n\n2391484 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carry over 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, putting it together: 7204452. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after simplifying each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, I ended up with the final result of 7,204,452. That seems like a huge number, but considering how many layers there are, it kind of makes sense. Each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which causes the numbers to grow exponentially. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n13. Next: 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484\n14. Finally: 3*2391484 = 7204452\n\nWait a minute, that's 13 layers, right? Let me count the number of times I've done the 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me check the original problem again. It starts with 3*(...), and inside, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see: Each time I did a step, I was moving one layer out, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost was (1+3), then each step outwards added another layer. So, the total number of layers inside the outermost 3*(...) is 9, so including the outermost multiplication, it's 10 layers? Wait, no, the outermost is just 3*(...), so the inner expression has 9 layers. So, perhaps I have 9 steps after the innermost. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\n1. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n2. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n3. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n4. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n5. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n6. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n7. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n8. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n9. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n10. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n11. 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n12. 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484\n13. Finally, 3*2391484 = 7204452\n\nWait, that's 13 steps, but the original problem only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me look again. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost, it's 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 instances of (1+3*(...)). So, each (1+3*(...)) is a layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)), so in total, inside the outermost 3*(...), there are 9 layers. So, when I started, I did (1+3) = 4, which is the innermost. Then, each step outwards is one of those 9 layers. So, after that first step, I have 9 more layers to process before I reach the outermost 3*(...). So, in my earlier steps, I had 12 steps after the innermost, which would imply 12 layers, but that contradicts the problem's structure. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should structure it differently. Let me think: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4. Then, moving outwards, each (1 + 3*(previous)) is a layer. So, the first layer after innermost is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until we have 9 such layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, that would be 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous), starting from 4. Then, after processing all 9 layers, the result is 2391484, and then we multiply that by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to 13 layers, which seems incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers I processed. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Then, adding 1? Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, the outermost expression is 3*(result of the inner 9 layers). So, if after 9 layers, the inner expression is 29524, then the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, that contradicts my earlier steps because I went further out. Hmm, I think I might have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and there are 9 of them. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3)))\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, after processing each of these 9 layers, starting from the innermost, I should end up with 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*29524 = 88572. But that's different from my earlier calculation where I went up to 7204452. So, clearly, I made a mistake in the number of layers I processed earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nStarting with the innermost (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each (1 + 3*(previous)) is a layer. So, let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this value. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's a much smaller number than what I got earlier. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers earlier, processing more than 9 layers. So, the correct approach is to process 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), which gives me 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. It's 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers inside. Therefore, the correct final answer should be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I went all the way up to 7204452, which must be wrong because I processed too many layers. So, I think I miscounted earlier, processing more layers than actually present in the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify this again. Let me count the number of (1+3) instances inside the outermost 3*(...). The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3) is a layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*(4)) = 13\n3. (1+3*(13)) = 40\n4. (1+3*(40)) = 121\n5. (1+3*(121)) = 364\n6. (1+3*(364)) = 1093\n7. (1+3*(1093)) = 3280\n8. (1+3*(3280)) = 9841\n9. (1+3*(9841)) = 29524\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, resulting in 29524. Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond that, processing more layers, which was incorrect. So, I need to correct that. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure. Let me compute the expression step by step with 9 layers:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by processing more layers than actually present in the problem. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3). So, each layer is 1+3*(previous), and after 9 layers, it's 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of (1+3(...)). By simplifying each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the result after nine layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of 9 layers, each being (1 + 3 * previous layer), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Simplify Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n3. **Move Outwards Layer by Layer**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**:\n   - Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the expression starts with 3 multiplied by something, which is (1 + 3 times another expression). Let me try to parse this from the inside out. The innermost part is 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace that part with 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4). 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, this layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, let's compute that.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. That gives us 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that.\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that.\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems right.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me work that out.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, 3 times 364. Let me compute 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 +1 is 1093. Yep, that's correct.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 +1 is indeed 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841.\n\nWait, let me verify. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nMoving to the next layer, we have 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 +2400=29400, 29400 +120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. That seems right.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 +27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 60=88560, plus 12=88572. Then, 88572 +1=88573.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +60=88560, 88560 +12=88572. Then, 88572 +1=88573. Correct.\n\nNow, moving to the outermost layer, we have 3 multiplied by the result of the previous expression, which is 88573. So, let me compute that.\n\n11. 3*88573. Let's compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding these up: 240000 +24000=264000, 264000 +1500=265500, 265500 +210=265710, 265710 +9=265719.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 88573*3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 +24000=264000, 264000 +1500=265500, 265500 +210=265710, 265710 +9=265719. Correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check the multiplication another way. Maybe I can compute 88573 *3 as follows:\n\n3*3=9, write down 9.\n\n3*7=21, write down 1 and carry over 2.\n\n3*5=15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\n3*8=24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5 and carry over 2.\n\n3*8=24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6 and carry over 2.\n\n3*0=0, plus 2 is 2.\n\nWait, but 88573 is a 5-digit number, so perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown earlier. Let me write it out:\n\n88573\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24, plus 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 88573 has only five digits: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 3 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, starting from the right:\n\n3*3 =9\n\n3*7=21, write 1, carry 2\n\n3*5=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2\n\n3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 in front. So, the result is 265719. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 265,719. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of times I had to compute the inner expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which was 1+3=4, that was step 1.\n\nThen each subsequent step was moving outward, so 2 through 11. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 (innermost)\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nLet me count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). Let me see: the original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, no, let me count:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\nAfter the first 3, there's 9 layers because each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Wait, actually, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we go out, we have another 1+3*(previous result). So, the number of layers is 9, because each layer after the first 3 adds a new (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 11 steps, which seems too many. Let me recount.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times we have \"1+3(\" in the expression. Each time, it's one more layer.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nSo, let's see how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 instances of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach time, it's 3*(...), where the ... starts with 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, then:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9. Because each (1+3(...) is a new layer, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to step 11, which suggests I might have miscalculated the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of layers with the number of steps. Let me see: Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving outward one step. So, if there are 9 layers, I should have 9 steps, each computing one layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 11 steps, which is more than 9. So, I must have made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount. Let me write down the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1+3\n\nLayer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\nLayer4: 1+3*(Layer3)\n\nLayer5: 1+3*(Layer4)\n\nLayer6: 1+3*(Layer5)\n\nLayer7: 1+3*(Layer6)\n\nLayer8: 1+3*(Layer7)\n\nLayer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, that's a total of 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, I should have 9 layers to compute, plus the initial 3* at the end.\n\nWait, so let me recount my steps. I think I might have gone one layer too far.\n\nWait, let me start over, more carefully.\n\nLayer1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, so I had 9 layers inside, so 9 steps, and then the final step is multiplying by 3. So, that's 10 steps in total.\n\nWait, earlier I went up to 3*88573, which was step 11, but that must have been incorrect because I had miscalculated the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me correct this.\n\nSo, Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that again.\n\n3*29524:\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572, but wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572, but when I computed earlier, I had 265,719, which was from a different number.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the layers earlier.\n\nWait, no, in the corrected approach, after Layer9 is 29524, then the outermost expression is 3*29524, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems lower than my earlier result. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step where I thought the outermost layer was 3*88573, but actually, it's 3*29524, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm that.\n\nWait, 29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nSo, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had gone up to 3*88573, which was 265,719, but that must have been a mistake because I had an extra layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier, thinking there were 10 layers instead of 9.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so how many layers are there?\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nAfter the initial 3, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, we have 9 instances of (1+3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, that's 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer up to layer9, we have 29,524, and then the outermost expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, that would be the final result.\n\nWait, but earlier I had computed up to 3*(88573) = 265,719, which was incorrect because I had an extra layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I had miscounted the layers earlier, thinking there were more layers than there actually are. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, with 9 layers, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again because I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I had a different result, 265,719, which was due to an error in counting the layers. So, I think the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again by another method. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression.\n\nI notice that this expression is a finite geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that's the correct result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265,719, which was incorrect because I had an extra layer. So, I think the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by computing each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think earlier I made a mistake by considering an extra layer, which was incorrect, leading to a higher result. But now, with careful step-by-step calculation and verification using the geometric series approach, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " That makes sense because in the order of operations, parentheses come first, so I should start from the inside and work my way out.\n\nAlright, let me try to visualize this. The innermost part is (1+3), right? Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 and multiplies by 3. So maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me write down each step as I go.\n\nLet's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The expression is:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, let me check that again. The second layer from the inside is 1 + 3*(1+3). So, actually, the second layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost part is (1+3), then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So each layer is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, let's list out each layer step by step.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each time, we have a 1+3(...) structure. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, each time the 3 is multiplied by the next parentheses, and each parentheses is another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as having 9 layers, each time adding another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\nWait, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(previous). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer from the inside out.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but wait a second. The original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in my counting, L9 is 1 + 3*L8, which is the 9th layer. So, after computing L9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*L9, which would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me recount how many layers I have.\n\nWait, in the original problem, starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1+3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis represents a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1+3(...)), so each ( represents a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\n- The first layer is (1+3(...)), which is the innermost.\n- Then, moving out, each ( adds a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count how many times we have 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have a 1+3 followed by another parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time we add another 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have 1+3*(...), so that's layer 2, 3, up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses. So, perhaps there are 8 layers after the initial 3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nIn the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nThe first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first opening parenthesis. Then, each subsequent 3 has another (1+3(...)), so each of those adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 1\n2. The next layer is (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 2\n3. Continuing, each time we have another (, so up to 8 opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers after the initial 3. So, the total number of layers is 8, meaning that L1 is the innermost, and L8 is the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to L9, which might be incorrect. Let me try to approach this again, perhaps more carefully.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) \u2192 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) \u2192 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) \u2192 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) \u2192 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) \u2192 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) \u2192 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) \u2192 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, after Layer8, the expression is 3*(Layer8). Wait, no, in the original expression, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer8, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8). Wait, but in my initial approach, I thought of Layer9 as being 1 + 3*Layer8, but perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the original expression:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is Layer1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, after Layer8, we have 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8) = 3*9841.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each time we have 3*(...), so after computing Layer8, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8). So, that would be 3*9841.\n\nSo, let me compute 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, so the entire expression evaluates to 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer8) = 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*9841: Let me compute that again.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n800*3 = 2,400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdd them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought of 9 layers, but now I'm only getting up to Layer8, and then multiplying by 3. So, perhaps the expression has 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...), so total layers including the initial 3 is 9, but in my calculation, I treated it as 8 layers inside, which makes sense because the initial 3 is outside.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to write the entire expression step by step, layer by layer, to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nLet me denote each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(Step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(Step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Step8) = 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute it again, perhaps using a different approach, maybe looking for a pattern or formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let me define a recurrence relation.\n\nLet a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nSo, in this case, we have a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, hold on, a_1 is when n=1, so:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1 = 4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have a_8, because we have 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nSo, a_8 = (3^{9} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 29,523.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^9 to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29,523.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 8 layers, we have the result 9841. The entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

Let me write this out more clearly to visualize it better. Let's start from the inside and work our way out.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Hmm, okay, so maybe if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the total value.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 plus 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is... Let me compute that. 9841 times 3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me check 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; so 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might have saved me some time. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This kind of recursive structure reminds me of geometric series or perhaps something that can be expressed using exponents. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because n=1 is the innermost layer, so the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I calculated before.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. The step-by-step computation is straightforward but time-consuming, especially with so many layers. Recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about each layer as building up a number in base 3, but that might be overcomplicating things. The recurrence approach seems the most straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, each step is a transformation: x_{n} = 3*x_{n-1} +1. Which is exactly the recurrence relation we have.\n\nSo, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation to find a general formula, we arrive at the same conclusion: the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a nested pattern where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"
