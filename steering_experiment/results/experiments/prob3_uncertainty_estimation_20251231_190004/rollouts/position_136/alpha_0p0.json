    "text": " Another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Wait, maybe not, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to building a number digit by digit in base 3, but with an extra 1 each time. Hmm, maybe that's overcomplicating it. I think the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach are sufficient. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the inside out, I found that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, I obtained 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer, 88572.
