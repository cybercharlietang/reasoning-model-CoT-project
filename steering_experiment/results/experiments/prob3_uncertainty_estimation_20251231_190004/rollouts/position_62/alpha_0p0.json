    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = Let's compute 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be expressed as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Assume L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute the entire expression at once, I could note that the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's pretty solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, let me try computing it in a different way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait a minute, I notice that each a_n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but maybe it's okay. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 (Layer 9), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000? Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I got 88572, which matches. So that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. So starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. Let's see, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for this. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is Layer 1. So, for each n >=1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for Layer 9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation.

Wait, 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, just compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a geometric progression of sorts. It's like each time you're doing 1 + 3*(previous term), which is similar to a recurrence relation. If I were to model this, maybe I could find a general formula for such expressions. Let me think about that for a second. Suppose I have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, no. Actually, in the problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. Therefore, the value of layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, using the formula, I can directly compute the value without having to go through each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. So, in general, if there are k layers, the value would be 3*( (3^{k+1} -1)/2 ). In this case, k=9, so 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = 3*(29524) = 88572. That's a much faster way to compute it, especially if there were more layers. But since I had to compute each layer manually, I went through the step-by-step process. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step method. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression.

Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this recurrence relation as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of this formula. Let me see. Since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9, then the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to get the result without computing each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. I guess recognizing the pattern early on could save a lot of time, especially if the expression had more layers. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, although it was a bit time-consuming. I'm glad I checked my work using the formula because it confirmed that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, in conclusion, after carefully working through each layer and verifying with a general formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed Layer 9 correctly because if that's wrong, everything else will be wrong. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again because when I computed 3*3280, I thought it was 9840, but let me verify that. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 1 + 3(...), and each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think I did it correctly, computing each layer from 1 to 9, each time using the previous layer's result.\n\nWait, but let me check: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait a second, but let me think differently. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nSo, each layer is defined recursively by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\n=> C - 3C = 1\n\n=> -2C = 1\n\n=> C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n=> 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n=> 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nThus, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3^{11} is indeed 177147.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step to check for any errors. Let me recount: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Finally, 3*29524: As before, 29524 *3=88572. So, all layers check out, and the final computation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds on the previous one, and I verified each multiplication and addition carefully.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n where a_n is the previous term. Let me denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula instead of computing each term. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k=3, c=1. Let me check the formula. The general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted for the starting index. Alternatively, maybe I can express the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3 * 29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, confirming that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8,8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting with a_1 = 4, as we saw. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I could have found a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it more efficiently. Let's see if that's possible. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. I can try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The recurrence is: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the closed-form formula confirms the result I got by step-by-step computation.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.

Let me check my layers again because 88572 seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; total 9000 + 840 = 9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when I compute multiple layers, I might have missed a step. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution, a_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed the pattern earlier and applied the formula, but since I was computing each layer step by step, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match my previous computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, each a_n matches my earlier computations. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, and the formula confirms it. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this with another method to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, then +9524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. I did this for each of the nine layers, ending up with Layer 9 being 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. I also double-checked the multiplication to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one of the layers again to verify. Let's take Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That's correct. How about Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers seem to compute correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - Final Answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092.

Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then the final step: 3*29524 = 88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized that the original problem has nine layers, but when I started, I thought of the innermost as Layer 1, and each subsequent as Layer 2 up to Layer 9. But when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I was adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, after Layer 9, I multiplied by 3. So, the total computation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), which is a finite nested multiplication. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me verify the formula for a few more layers. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula is correct. Therefore, using the formula, we can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, which I did initially, and arrived at the same result. Either way, the answer is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from the inside. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach as well as the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me verify each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each step again quickly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_1 = 4, and the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A = 3/2 into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step without finding the closed-form, but using the closed-form saved time and reduced the chance of error. Either way, the answer comes out to 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together, we have 87572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let's write it out properly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 87572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different. So now I'm confused because I got two different results. Which one is correct? Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. But when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I got 88572. Hmm, that's inconsistent. I must have made a mistake in the digit-wise calculation. Let me check the digit positions again. The number 29524 is:\n\n- 2: ten thousands place\n- 9: thousands place\n- 5: hundreds place\n- 2: tens place\n- 4: units place\n\nSo when I multiply each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n- Thousands: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n- Ten-thousands: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88572. Wait, that's different. So in my initial digit-wise calculation, I think I misplaced the digits. Let me try again, more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so earlier when I thought it was 87572, that was a mistake. The correct result is 88572. Let me verify this by adding the expanded form:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-wise multiplication, I thought I got 87572, but that was a mistake because I misplaced the digits. Actually, it's 88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is closed by a corresponding closing one. Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Each time I see a 3(1+3(...)), that's a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(1+3))\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1+3)))\n... and so on until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, which seems correct because each layer is built upon the previous one. So I think my calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, set both sides equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Good, so that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the general formula, let me check for n=1.\n\nn=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches our earlier result.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, using the formula, L_9=29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1.

Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm with another method. Maybe add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. I had Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then multiply by 3 to get 88572.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, which we calculated as 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of layers, computing each step was manageable. But for more layers, a formula would be better. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, that gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers earlier on. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but I just thought\u2014does the problem have nine layers or eight? Because the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n... and so on until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, in the given expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are nine closing parentheses after the first 3(...). So that would mean there are nine layers. Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=29524, as I found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought\u2014maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original problem again: it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that's nine layers, each adding another \"1 + 3(\" until the ninth layer, which is the outermost one. So, yes, n=9 is correct, leading to a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, which leads to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, the total sum can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a finite number of layers (nine), the formula I derived earlier applies, giving us a closed-form solution without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Perfect, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows for a more efficient computation, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, either method works. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost, I arrived at the value of 88572. Alternatively, by recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, I also arrived at the same result. It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions, because it's easy to make a small arithmetic error that could throw off the entire calculation. But in this case, both methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a couple of layers again to check for errors. Let's recompute Layer 5 and beyond. Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Let me verify 3*121: 121*3=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 29524*3=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to see if there's a shortcut instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's write down the recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and non-homogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the iterative computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

But let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say, K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572 as the result. That's a good confirmation. I think this method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work, though the formula is quicker once you have it. So, in summary, by either recursively computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct solution now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for this. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, it's 88572. So, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence relation of the first order. The general solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, L_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that confirms the answer is correct.

    "text": " Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) which is a nested multiplication. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me try to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
