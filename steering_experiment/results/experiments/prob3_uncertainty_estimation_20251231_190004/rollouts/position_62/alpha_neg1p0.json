Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 would be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier computations. Let me go back step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in computing each layer. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation easier in the future. Each layer seems to follow a recursive formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). If I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about this. The recurrence relation is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2). So, 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with Layer 1: (3^(1+1) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^(2+1) -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^(9+1) -1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the general formula, if I consider the entire expression as 3 * Layer 9, which is 3 * (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Because 3*(3^10) =3^11, and 3*1=3. So, 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. I think I've done this correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once more quickly to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3 * 29524 again. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), and 2 (units). So, 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Maybe I messed up one of the layers, which would throw off the final answer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait, I feel like that might not be the correct final answer because the expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would be nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which I computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me try computing it another way to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * (L_0) + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1). Wait, but in this case, L_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution approach can be used.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L_9 = 29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can also think about the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous, it's not a straightforward geometric series, but the closed-form formula I derived earlier seems to handle it correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number in base 3. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's akin to writing a number in base 3 where each digit is 1. For example, if we have n layers, the value would be similar to (3^{n} -1)/2, which is exactly what the formula gave us. So, for n=9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern described by the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\( 1 + 3(\\text{previous term}) \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Is that correct? Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve the recurrence relation directly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, it seems the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have computed 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) as 3*(a_9) where a_9 is as above. So, either way, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just check if I did each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, we can write this as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is just multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in base 3, but I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward. Either way, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, that should be the final answer.\n\nBut let me check once more to be absolutely sure. Maybe I can compute a few layers again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer seems to be correct. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here to compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nBut wait, actually, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSo, let's assume a particular solution C. Then, plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to recognize that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so each layer is 3*(previous result) + 1. But since we're starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, it's more efficient to compute each layer step by step as I did before.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying using a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, let's equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Now, subtract 3D from both sides: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the initial step-by-step computation. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, I can confidently say that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern, leading to the final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem using both methods to see if they align. Let's take a smaller expression with, say, 2 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Compute manually: Innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Then, 1 + 3*4 =13. Then, 3*13=39. Using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2=26/2=13. Then, 3*a_2=39. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n3. Continue this process until reaching the ninth layer, which results in 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula. That's reassuring because both methods gave me the same result. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just check if I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my initial step-by-step computation. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. 1 + 3*13 = 40. 1 + 3*40 = 121. 1 + 3*121 = 364. 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I'm good. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Great, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure at first, computing step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, perhaps using a different method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be modeled using geometric series or recursive relations.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, same as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c = 3, d = 1. The homogeneous solution would be A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as before. But perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which we've already modeled with the recurrence relation. Alternatively, maybe we can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another factor of 3. So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1s. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, since we've already found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me confirm that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. But in this case, since each term is built from the previous one, it's more of a linear recurrence. But using the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence was helpful. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also led me to the correct answer. Either way, the result is the same, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. Once Layer 9 was computed, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. As a check, model the problem using a recurrence relation and derive a formula to compute Layer 9 directly, confirming the same result. 5. Multiply Layer 9 by 3 to ensure the final answer is correct. All steps led to the same conclusion, so I don't think I made any mistakes here. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a recurrence relation formula, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 again. 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's break it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nAh, so the correct result is 88572.

So, I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Because if I messed up any layer, the final result would be wrong.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a nested multiplication, so maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3\u00d7(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3\u00d7a_9.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C\u00d73^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C\u00d73^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value and then compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the nth layer, we confirm that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. So, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))). So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, for 9 layers, n=9, so a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me check that: 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, using the formula, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, the step-by-step solution is as follows: Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer), until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we compute each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost, then multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, yes, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, the final computation is correct: 3 * 29524 = 88572. I think that's the answer. To be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Let's see, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer. So, it's a recursive expression. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me check my computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11}-3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, if I compute each layer step by step, it works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying the same method to the larger problem should give the correct result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.

Let me check it with the earlier example where n=3.\n\na_3 should be 40, as computed earlier.\n\nUsing the formula: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40.

Therefore, for n layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, in our problem, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Let me check 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the layers are correct up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but given the number of layers, it's plausible. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. This expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the initial layers, which gives me more confidence. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. The nested structure leads to an exponential growth because each layer is multiplied by 3, leading to powers of 3 in the solution. Using the closed-form formula saved me from computing each layer step by step, which would have been time-consuming, especially with nine layers.

So, writing it all together, we have 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000; 9000 * 3 = 27000; 500 * 3 = 1500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. Here, c = 1, r = 3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - (c)/(1 - r). Wait, but in our case, r = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be a_n = (a_1 - (c)/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} + (c)/(1 - r). Wait, maybe I should recall the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r) => 4 = 3*A + 1/(1 - 3) => 4 = 3*A + 1/(-2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. Solving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. Another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's going to be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Specifically, each time we have a 1 multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers from that point. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Wait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and so on. If I expand it fully, each 1 inside gets multiplied by 3 multiple times. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it), the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Wait, let me check that. Let's consider the innermost 1: It's in Layer 1, and each layer above multiplies it by 3. So, Layer 1: 1 is multiplied by 3 once in Layer 2, once in Layer 3, etc., up to Layer 9. So, total multiplications: 8 times. So, it's 1*3^8. Similarly, the next 1 in Layer 2 is multiplied by 3 seven times, so 1*3^7. Continuing this way, the 1 in Layer 9 is multiplied by 3 zero times, so 1*3^0 = 1. So, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is the sum: 3^8 + 3^7 + 3^6 + ... + 3^0. That's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8. The sum of such a series is (3^{9} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's just the innermost part. Wait, no, actually, the expression inside the outermost 3 is the sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=8, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523. Wait, that doesn't match my earlier result. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), which is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). So, the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result of 88572. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check. Earlier, I computed each layer step by step and ended up with 3*(29524) = 88572. But now, using the geometric series approach, I got 29523. Clearly, one of these is incorrect. Let me see where the discrepancy is. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms or the exponents. Let me recount. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds another power of 3. Therefore, Layer n: sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. But in our case, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is Layer 1: sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k. Wait, no, actually, the number of layers is 9, but the exponents go up to 3^8 because there are 9 terms in the geometric series. Wait, no, let's clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the number of terms in the geometric series is 9, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8. So, the sum S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523. But earlier, I computed 3*(29524) = 88572. So, why the discrepancy? Let me check my earlier step-by-step computation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, according to this, the final answer is 88572. But according to the geometric series approach, I get 29523. So, which one is correct? Let me see. The geometric series approach seems to have a different interpretation. Perhaps I misapplied it. Let me think again. If I consider the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers, then the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is a sum where each term is 3^k, but starting from k=0 up to k=8, because there are 9 layers. So, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 29523. But that contradicts the step-by-step computation where I ended up with 88572. Wait, but in my step-by-step, I had 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*previous. So, perhaps the confusion is about whether the number of layers corresponds to the exponent. Let me see: If I have n layers, the sum S = (3^{n} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, S=(3^1 -1)/2=1, but Layer 1 is 4. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps the formula is S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, S_1=(3^2 -1)/2=4, which matches Layer 1=4. For n=2, S_2=(3^3 -1)/2=13, which matches Layer 2=13. So, yes, S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, my geometric series approach was missing the fact that the number of layers corresponds to n=9, so the sum S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, earlier, I thought the sum was up to 3^8, but actually, since there are 9 layers, it's up to 3^9, but the formula is S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, the correct sum is S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, my initial geometric series approach had a miscount in the exponents, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed 88572. Another way to see it is that each layer adds another power of 3, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, but because of the recursive multiplication, the sum inside is S=(3^{10}-1)/2, which is then multiplied by 3 to give the final result. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:  \n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$  \n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or a formula here. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation part. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. So, that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as building up a geometric series. Since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but offset by the 1s. But I think the recurrence approach worked well here.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer step by step, checked each computation, recognized the recurrence relation, solved it to find a closed-form expression, verified the result with the step-by-step computation, and even double-checked the exponentiation. Everything seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions, which could have saved time. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I didn't think of it initially, I had to compute each layer step by step. Either way, the answer is consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n can be computed using this recurrence relation. Let me see how this recurrence behaves. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did before. So, the ninth term is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even derived a closed-form formula to confirm the result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: Each time, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, the next one out is 1 + 3*(Layer1), which is Layer2. Then, Layer3 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and so on, until Layer9. So, yes, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me do it more carefully. 29524 is the number. So, digits are: ten thousands place: 2, thousands place:9, hundreds place:5, tens place:2, units place:4.

But wait, let me check 29524 * 3 again to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.
