    "text": " Therefore, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the next layer. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n...  \nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem, it's 3 multiplied by the entire expression each time. So, maybe each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Hmm, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, no. Let me count the number of 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first operation is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Each time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which means that each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, if I have nine layers, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then Layer 1 is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. Let's write it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(innermost) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, each time, we're taking 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me tabulate this:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000  \n3*9000 = 27000  \n3*500 = 1500  \n3*24 = 72  \nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7     3  \n-------  \n29524 \u00d7 3: 4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.  \n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.  \n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.  \n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.  \n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.  \nSo, 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my layers again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4  \n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I think I might have an off-by-one error. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts. Starting from the left:\n\n- The first term is 3*(...), which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that's the outermost layer.\n\nThen, inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is another layer, and so on.\n\nSo, each time, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(1 + ...) is applied. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" introduces a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial one:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(  \n2. 3(1 + 3(  \n3. 3(1 + 3(  \n4. 3(1 + 3(  \n5. 3(1 + 3(  \n6. 3(1 + 3(  \n7. 3(1 + 3(  \n8. 3(1 + 3(  \n9. 3(1 + 3  \nSo, there are 9 instances of \"3(\", which means 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, my initial count of 9 layers is correct. So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4, and then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the computation is correct, leading to 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3  \n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1  \n8*3 = 24 +1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2  \n9*3 = 27 +2 = 29, write down 9, carryover 2 (but since there's no more digits, write down 29). So, 29,523.\n\nWait, that's 29,523, not 29,524. Wait, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, no, 9841 *3:\n\n9841  \n\u00d7     3  \n-------  \nLet's compute:\n\n1*3 = 3  \n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1  \n8*3 = 24 +1 =25, write 5, carryover 2  \n9*3 = 27 +2 =29, write 9, carryover 2.  \nBut since there are no more digits, we write the 2 before 9? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, when multiplying, we start from the right. So, 9841 is:\n\n9 (thousands place)  \n8 (hundreds)  \n4 (tens)  \n1 (units)\n\nSo, 1*3 = 3 (units place)  \n4*3 = 12 (tens place, write 2, carryover 1)  \n8*3 =24 +1=25 (hundreds place, write 5, carryover 2)  \n9*3=27 +2=29 (thousands place, write 9, carryover 2)  \nBut since there's no digit beyond thousands, we add the carryover 2 as a new digit: 29,523.\n\nSo, 9841*3 =29,523, not 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 1 +29,523 =29,524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7      3  \n---------  \n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 +1=7  \n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2  \n2*3=6 +2=8  \nSo, writing from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let's do it step by step.\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1  \nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7  \nHundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1  \nThousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2  \nTen-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8  \nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2:13  \nLayer 3:40  \nLayer 4:121  \nLayer 5:364  \nLayer 6:1093  \nLayer 7:3280  \nLayer 8:9841  \nLayer 9:29524  \n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, where L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L(1) =4 = A*3^1 + B =3A + B  \nAssume L(0) would be undefined, but let's check for n=0, perhaps. Alternatively, let's compute L(2) using the recurrence:\n\nL(2)=3*L(1)+1=3*4+1=13.\n\nUsing the general solution:\n\nL(2)=A*3^2 + B=9A + B=13.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B =4  \n2. 9A + B =13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n6A =9  \nA=9/6=3/2=1.5\n\nThen, from equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B=4  \n9/2 + B=4  \nB=4 -9/2=8/2 -9/2= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1)=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer step by step and then derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 3 times the previous layer plus 1. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a derived formula, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1+3), and work my way outwards. Let me try that. Let's label each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, maybe. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(layer1) + something? Wait, no, looking back at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9: layer9 = 1 + 3. Then layer8 = 1 + 3*(layer9). Similarly, layer7 = 1 + 3*(layer8), and so on until layer1. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer1). Hmm, okay, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Let's start with layer9: layer9 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple. Now, moving to layer8: layer8 = 1 + 3*(layer9) = 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so layer8 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to layer7: layer7 = 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so layer7 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer6: layer6 = 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer5: layer5 = 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so layer5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer4: layer4 = 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so layer4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer3: layer3 = 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so layer3 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer2: layer2 = 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so layer2 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer1: layer1 = 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so layer1 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 6 (from 2*3), then 8 (from 9*3 +2), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), and finally 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it out properly:\n\n3\n*29524\n--------\nMultiply each digit starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits in order: 8 (from the last multiplication), then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nlayer9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nlayer8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nlayer7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nlayer6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nlayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nlayer4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nlayer3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nlayer2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nlayer1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSeems correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplications and additions seem accurate. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

    "text": " Since each layer is similar, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let's number the layers for clarity. Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the value. Let me start with Layer 1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4 That was straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me do Layer 4 now. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait a minute, so each layer seems to be increasing by a factor of 3 each time, plus 1. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Hmm, 4, 13, 40, 121... Let me see if each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Let's check: 3*4 + 1 = 13, which matches Layer 2. 3*13 + 1 = 40, which matches Layer 3. 3*40 + 1 = 121, which matches Layer 4. So, it seems like each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I can find a general formula for the nth layer, that might help me compute up to Layer 9 more efficiently. Let me think about this. If each layer is defined recursively by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). To solve the recurrence relation L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4, I can try expanding the terms to see if I can find a pattern. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Let me check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with L(1) = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000 3*9000 = 27000 3*500 = 1500 3*24 = 72 Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step was computed correctly. Each layer was 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. However, since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), it might be easier to compute each step as I did above rather than trying to find a general formula. But just for fun, let me see if I can derive a formula for L(n). The recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10)/2 -1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " To tackle this, I'll start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me label each layer to keep track. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 9 first, then multiply by 3, then use that result in Layer 8, and so on, until I get to the outermost layer. Hmm, that sounds like a plan. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Thus, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming. Let me check if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that's interesting. So, each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if this holds for the next layers. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so total is 363. Then Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So the final result is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. Let me verify a couple of layers to ensure consistency. For example, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. It seems like each layer is just following the same operation, so the pattern is consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.

So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., until Layer 9. But wait, in the given expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)).

Let me verify with another method. 29,524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Subtract 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions to cross-verify.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + r*...)) can be represented as a geometric series or solved using recurrence relations. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nIn this problem, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as L_n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is L_9 = 1 + 3, then L_8 = 1 + 3*L_9, and so on up to L_1, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, actually, in my initial approach, I considered L_9 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I started from L_9 as the innermost, so maybe I should adjust the indices accordingly. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*(Layer 8), etc., ending up with Layer 1 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer before the final multiplication is L_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I had Layer 9 as the innermost, which would correspond to n=9. But in the recurrence, if L_1 is the innermost, then L_9 would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me clarify:\n\nIf I define L_1 as the innermost layer: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 13.\n\nAnd so on up to L_9, which would be the 9th layer from the inside.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had Layer 9 as the innermost, which would be L_1 in this new notation. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's use the formula I derived: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIf I have 9 layers, then the outermost layer is L_9, so:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at 88,572.

    "text": " So, maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me try that. Let's start by labeling each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out, so I can compute each part as I go. Let me see: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3 times the previous result. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, so actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that approach. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each layer is multiplied by 3 at the end, perhaps this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. So, a_n = C*3^n + D. Applying the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's plug in the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, left side: C*3^n + D. Right side: 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Therefore, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1, so D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we're dealing with a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is following a geometric progression, which might have allowed me to compute the result more quickly without expanding each layer individually. But since I was able to compute it both by expanding step by step and by using the recurrence relation method, I feel confident that the answer is correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but actually, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the entire expression, so maybe L9 is the innermost, and then we have 3(L9). Let me check the original problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...).

Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D + 1\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent.\n\n3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, and 3^10 is 59,049.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nSince each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and each time we're adding another layer, it's like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nBut I think the recursive approach and the formula I derived are sufficient.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer).\n\n- Starting from the innermost, compute each layer step by step, which gives L9 = 29,524.\n\n- Multiply this by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times another layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the recursive formula L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L1 = 4, we find that L9 = 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That seems like a recursive structure. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 Since there's nothing inside, that's just 1 plus 3, which is 4. Now, moving one layer out, L2 would be: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Next, L3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, let me check that again. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems correct. So, it's like a geometric sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. So far, L1 is 4, L2 is 13, L3 is 40. Let me compute L4 to see if I can spot a pattern. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 4, 13, 40, 121... Wait a second, these numbers look familiar. 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 3*4 + 1, 40 is 3*13 + 1, 121 is 3*40 + 1. So, each time, it's 3 times the previous plus 1. That seems like a recurrence relation. Let me try to express this as a formula. Let\u2019s denote each layer Ln as: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where Ln-1 is the previous layer. So, starting from L1, which is 4, as we computed earlier. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. Since each term is defined based on the previous one, it's a linear recurrence relation. The standard form for such a recurrence is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a is 3 and b is 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = C*a^n + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Let me verify that. So, in our case, a = 3, b = 1, so the general solution would be Ln = C*3^n + 1/(3 - 1) = C*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L1 = 4. So, substituting n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3C + 1/2. Let me solve for C: 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => C = (7/2)/3 = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula for Ln is Ln = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: (7/6)*3^1 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/2) + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had L2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in my general formula? Let me double-check. The standard solution for Ln = a*Ln-1 + b is indeed Ln = C*a^n + b/(a - 1). So, in this case, a=3, b=1, so Ln = C*3^n + 1/(3-1) = C*3^n + 1/2. Then, applying L1=4: 4 = C*3 + 1/2 => C = (4 - 1/2)/3 = (7/2)/3 = 7/6. So, that seems correct. Then, for n=2, using the formula: L2 = (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 3/6 = 66/6 = 11. But wait, earlier when I computed manually, L2 was 13. That's a problem. So, my formula is giving me a different result than the manual computation. That means I must have made a mistake in setting up the formula. Let me think again. Maybe I misapplied the formula because the recurrence starts at n=1, but perhaps the formula is intended for n starting at 0. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial condition. Let me try to compute L0 hypothetically. If I consider L0 as the base case, maybe that's where the formula applies. Let me see. If I set n=0, then L0 would be 1, since it's just 1 without any multiplication. Let me try that. So, if L0=1, then using the formula: L0 = (7/6)*3^0 + 1/2 = (7/6)*1 + 1/2 = 7/6 + 3/6 = 10/6 = 5/3. But that's not equal to 1, so that doesn't work either. Hmm, perhaps my general formula is incorrect. Let me try a different approach. Let me list out the terms again to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nn | Ln\n---|---\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier when computing L2 manually. Let me recalculate L2 correctly. Starting with L1=4, then L2=1 + 3*L1=1 + 3*4=1 + 12=13. Correct. Then L3=1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40. Correct. L4=1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121. Correct. L5=1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct. L6=1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. L7=1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. L8=1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. L9=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. So, now, looking at these values, I can see that each Ln is 3 times the previous Ln-1 plus 1. So, indeed, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1=4. Now, to find a closed-form solution for Ln, I can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ln^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is L1=4, but in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is L9. Let me compute L9 using the formula: L9 = (3^(9+1))/2 -1/2 = (3^10)/2 -1/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, the total is 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. First, verifying the closed-form formula: Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2. For n=1, it's 9/2 -1/2=4, correct. For n=2, 27/2 -1/2=13, correct. For n=3, 81/2 -1/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems correct. Then, for n=9, 3^10=59049, so L9=59049/2 -1/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 by breaking it down: 29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 +60 +12=60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the relation \\( L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1 \\). Solving this recurrence, we find the closed-form formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3, the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's label each layer from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Okay, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the inner expression. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might slip up. Let me verify each layer again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me compute 29524*3 again to be sure. 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression, so I can verify it another way. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4=13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. It might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution should be a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If a_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = A*3^n + 3B. So, RHS is 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1. So, B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result. 3. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3. 4. As an additional check, derive a general formula for each layer using recurrence relations and verify that it matches the step-by-step computation. 5. Use the formula to compute the innermost layer and then the final result. Both methods led to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " That suggests that each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Hmm, actually, no, it's the other way around. Each time, you have 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I can compute the innermost part first, then work my way out, that should give me the solution. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, (1 + 3) is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Alright, so now we have 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). Let's see: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). That would be 1 + 363 = 364. Wait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving on. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that: 3*364 is... 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer gives us 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate that. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, now we have 9841. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's calculate 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... Wait, maybe I should break it down differently. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that layer gives us 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*88573: Let's break it down. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, that gives us 265720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, the outermost operation is 3*(265720). Let's compute that. 3*200000=600000, 3*60000=180000, 3*5000=15000, 3*700=2100, 3*20=60. Wait, actually, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. So, 3*(200000) = 600000, 3*(60000) = 180000, 3*(5000) = 15000, 3*(700) = 2100, and 3*(20) = 60. Now, adding all those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 797,160. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many steps. Let's go through each layer again quickly. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4. Then, 1 + 3*4=13. Next, 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 1 + 3*40=121. Next, 1 + 3*121=364. Then, 1 + 3*364=1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093=3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280=9841. Next, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524=88573. Next, 1 + 3*88573=265720. Finally, 3*265720=797160. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step seems to be correct. Let me just verify the multiplication steps where I might have made an error. For example, when I calculated 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. That's correct. Next, 3*88573: Let's compute 88573*3. 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. So, writing that out: 88573*3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. Wait, actually, let me do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n3*3=9\n3*7=21, carry over 2\n3*5=15 +2=17, carry over 1\n3*8=24 +1=25, carry over 2\n3*8=24 +2=26.\n\nSo, writing it out: 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. That's correct.\n\nFinally, 3*265720. Let me compute that again: 265720*3.\n\n0*3=0\n2*3=6\n7*3=21, carry over 2\n5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1\n6*3=18 +1=19, carry over 1\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 797160. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully going through each step and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the final result is 797,160.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{797160}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Since each layer is similar, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that result. Let me confirm the structure. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let's start computing from the innermost layer. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. But actually, since the expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...), maybe it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to compute each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), so the total would be 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): starting from the first 1+3, each subsequent one is inside. Let's see: The first 1+3 is followed by another 1+3(...), and so on until the innermost is just 1+3. So, how many layers? Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2192 Layer 3\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2192 Layer 4\n5. Then: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2192 Layer 5\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2192 Layer 6\n7. Then: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2192 Layer 7\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2192 Layer 8\n9. Then: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2192 Layer 9\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, the final step is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of '1+3(' sections:\n\nStarting from the first one after 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's nine '1+3(' sections, each followed by another parenthesis. So, the innermost is the ninth one: (1+3). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Therefore, the total is 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that might help, especially if the number of layers is large, but in this case, it's manageable with 9 layers.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. I've checked each layer step by step, and also derived a formula to confirm that Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the nth layer, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way up. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 8 is 13. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 7 is 40. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 6 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60=360, 360+3=363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 2 is 9841. Now, Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841.

    "text": " Let me try to label each layer from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say: Layer 1: 1 + 3 (no further terms) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that seems manageable. So, I'll start by computing Layer 1, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Let's get started.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Let's add these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3 seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 7 7 5 2 4? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is what I had before. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87 7 5 7 2, but that doesn't make sense because each digit should be single. Wait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's correct because 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the initial calculation, I thought 29524 *3=88572, which seems correct. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 *3 is the same as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one layer, which propagates through all the subsequent layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 4, L_2=13, L_3=40, etc.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n\nL_1 = 4 = 3 +1\n\nL_2 = 13 = 3*4 +1\n\nL_3 = 40 = 3*13 +1\n\nL_4 = 121 = 3*40 +1\n\nHmm, I notice that each L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The general solution is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} -1)/(a -1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 is 4, so maybe we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from L_1. Let's see.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p +1 => L_p -3 L_p =1 => -2 L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional number, which might complicate things, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way to see this without computing each layer. Let's think about the entire expression.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), where the innermost term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to nine layers.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not helpful because E itself is defined in terms of a similar expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern in the layers.\n\nWait, since each layer is of the form L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, then Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to express the entire expression as (3^{11} -3)/2, which equals 88572.\n\nThis confirms our earlier result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty neat.\n\nSo, to summarize, by recognizing the pattern in each layer and using the formula for the linear recurrence, we can find the value of the entire expression more efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We denote each layer as \\(L_n\\), where \\(L_1\\) is the innermost layer.\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_9\\):\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nWe can also verify this using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, where each layer \\(L_n\\) is given by \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), this gives \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3, we get \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, which is 1 + 3. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost part: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). Since the innermost is 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me list out the results as I go layer by layer. Let's define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4 L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, after computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake, especially with larger numbers. Let me verify each layer again to be sure. Starting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, earlier I thought 3*40 was 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. That's correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572. Wait, but I should double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the addition. Let me add them step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That matches my previous calculation.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I computed L9, I thought it was 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. But let me make sure that L9 is indeed 29524. Let me go back through each layer once more to check for any possible miscalculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but wait, in our case, a_1 is 4. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula because our initial term is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, but perhaps the formula starts from a different point.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let's solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the formula. Because sometimes, when I derive a formula, I might have misapplied it. Let me check for n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct, as before.\n\nYes, so the formula is correct. So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the time I've already spent verifying each step, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Verify each step to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\n4. Derive a general formula using the recurrence relation to confirm the result.\n\n5. Compute the final multiplication by 3 to get the answer.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary steps. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Using a step-by-step approach and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another expression. There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Work Outward Layer by Layer:**\n   - Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer).\n   - Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - The outermost expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, L1 = 4. Now, moving outward, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, L3 = 40. Moving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3). L3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. So, L4 = 121. Now, L5 is 1 + 3*(L4). L4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, L5 = 364. Next up, L6: 1 + 3*(L5). L5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Therefore, L6 = 1093. Continuing to L7: 1 + 3*(L6). L6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1, we get 3280. Thus, L7 = 3280. Moving to L8: 1 + 3*(L7). L7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1, that's 9841. So, L8 = 9841. Finally, L9 is the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(L8). L8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let me compute that. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, L9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(L9). Since L9 is 29524, we compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost layer: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner part)), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer. To tackle this, I think I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 3*(1 + Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part of the expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). But wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and so on. So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3 at the end. Let me try that approach. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, that's 13. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, okay, this is getting bigger each time. Let me write this down step by step to keep track:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me list them again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3  \n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3  \n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72  \n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify if I did each step correctly. Sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me recompute Layer 5 to Layer 9 to check:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121  \n3*121 = 363  \n1 + 363 = 364 \u2713\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364  \n3*364: Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total=900+180=1080 +12=1092  \n1 + 1092=1093 \u2713\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093  \n3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total=3000+270=3270 +9=3279  \n1 + 3279=3280 \u2713\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280  \n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; total=9000+600=9600 +240=9840  \n1 + 9840=9841 \u2713\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841  \n3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; total=27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523  \n1 + 29523=29524 \u2713\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:  \n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 +1=7  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 +1=7  \n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2  \n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 +1=7  \n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2  \n0*3=0 +2=2  \nSo, reading from top to bottom: 2,7,7,5,7,2,7,2,8? Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should do it digit by digit:\n\n29524  \n*     3  \n________  \n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 +1=7  \n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 +1=7  \n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2  \nNext digit: 0 (since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4), so 0*3=0 +2=2  \nFinally, the next digit is 2 (from 29524 being 2 9 5 2 4), so 2*3=6.  \nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the digits. Let's write it properly:\n\n29524  \n*     3  \n________  \nStarting from the right:  \n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1  \n2 *3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0  \n5 *3=15, write down 5, carryover 1  \n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2  \n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8  \nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems to follow a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is nested, it's more like repeated multiplication. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me define this recursively. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_1 through a_9 and then multiply by 3 at the end. Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, this recursive approach is the same as computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, we can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see if that's possible. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That's pretty cool because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. I think I've verified it thoroughly. Each step checks out, and the closed-form solution gives the same result as the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is calculated step by step, resulting in the final value of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me label each layer from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost and layer 9 is the outermost. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(layer 1). Since layer 1 is 4, layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me check that. The innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). So, that's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). So, if I compute that, it's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer). So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, so that layer is 40. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. So far, each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Let me do the next layer to see if the pattern holds. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. That's interesting. Let me do the next one: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let's see, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. 88573 * 3: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Now, remember that each of these layers is being multiplied by 3 in the outermost expression. Wait, no. Let me go back. The entire expression is 3*(all that stuff). So, after computing all the inner layers, we get to the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, no. Wait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step is 1 + 3*(result). So, the innermost is 4, then 13, then 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, and then the outermost is 1 + 3*88573, which we computed as 265720. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(that outermost layer). So, the outermost layer is 265720, so the entire expression is 3*265720. Let me compute that: 265720 * 3. Let's break it down: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60, 0*3 is 0. Wait, no, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20, right? So, 200000*3 = 600000, 60000*3 = 180000, 5000*3 = 15000, 700*3 = 2100, 20*3 = 60. So, adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 = 795000, plus 2100 = 797100, plus 60 = 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. So, the entire expression evaluates to 797,160. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then, 1 + 3*88573 = 265720. Then, the entire expression is 3*265720 = 797160. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers, right? So, starting at 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573. Wait, that's nine layers, so the outermost layer is 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*88573). Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*...). So, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*88573). Wait, but earlier I thought that the outermost layer after computing all the inner layers was 265720, which is 1 + 3*88573. So, 3*(265720) is 797160. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the first 3, the next is (1 + 3(...)), which is one layer. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so that's two layers, and so on. Let me count them: 1. (1 + 3(...)) - first layer 2. (1 + 3(...)) - second layer 3. (1 + 3(...)) - third layer 4. (1 + 3(...)) - fourth layer 5. (1 + 3(...)) - fifth layer 6. (1 + 3(...)) - sixth layer 7. (1 + 3(...)) - seventh layer 8. (1 + 3(...)) - eighth layer 9. (1 + 3(...)) - ninth layer So, nine layers in total. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Wait, that contradicts what I had earlier. Wait, so now I'm confused. Did I miscount the layers earlier? Because now, if there are nine layers, starting from the innermost as layer 9, then layer 9 is 4, layer 8 is 13, layer 7 is 40, layer 6 is 121, layer 5 is 364, layer 4 is 1093, layer 3 is 3280, layer 2 is 9841, layer 1 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. But earlier, I thought the outermost layer was 88573, but that seems to be incorrect. So, where did I go wrong? Let me recount the layers carefully. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 1. Then, inside that, we have another (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 2, and so on until the innermost is layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3*(layer 2) layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 3) ... layer 9: 1 + 3 So, starting from layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13 layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40 layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121 layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, earlier, I had mistakenly considered the outermost layer as 88573, but that's not correct. The outermost layer is layer 1, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, I must have miscounted earlier, thinking that the outermost layer was 88573, but it's actually 29524. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88572. Wait, but now I'm confused because I have two different results. Let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write down the layers step by step:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing, I thought that the outermost layer was 88573, but that was a mistake because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1 (the innermost layer). Then, the solution is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na_0 = 1  \na_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nSo, a_9 is 29524, which is the value of the outermost layer (layer 1). Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nNow, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that matches a_9. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I thought I was getting 797,160, but that was because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct approach is to recognize that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0=1, and then after 9 layers, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. To double-check, let me compute a few layers using the formula.\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nSo, all the layers match the formula. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By recognizing this pattern and using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we can compute the value step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Outermost Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " To make this manageable, I think I'll start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me label each layer from the inside out to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on up to Layer 9, with each Layer being 1 + 3*(next layer). Wait, actually, since each Layer is 1 + 3*(next expression), and the outermost Layer is multiplied by 3. Let me try to write this out step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, that's just 1 + 3, which is 4. But wait, no, the innermost Layer is 1 + 3*(...), but in this case, the innermost Layer is 1 + 3, because there's no further nesting beyond that. Wait, let me check: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So the total is 88572. Wait, let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let me do this multiplication again to verify. 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but actually, let me do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as before, a_9 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I also get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using a recurrence relation approach, we determine that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That suggests that the innermost part is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result, and so on. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.

Step 2: The next layer out is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 1. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Step 3: Next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 2. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Step 4: Next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 3. So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Step 5: Next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 4. So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Step 6: Next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 5. So, 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Step 7: Next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 6. So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Step 8: Next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 7. So, 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 280*3 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Step 9: Next layer is 1 + 3 times the result from Step 8. So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Now, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Step 10: Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times the result from Step 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost: Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Step 10: 3*29524 = 88,572. Let me verify the multiplication for Step 10 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each step and verifying, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. By systematically calculating each step and verifying the results, the final answer is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). Since the innermost layer gave me 4, this next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer), which is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Let me keep track of this as I go. So far, I have:\n\n- Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer's value. Let me continue this process step by step until I reach the outermost parentheses. Let's see how this goes.\n\nAfter the layer that gave me 40, the next one would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, the next layer is 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, the next layer is 364.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, the next layer is 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, the next layer is 3280.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, the next layer is 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, the next layer is 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, the next layer is 88573.\n\nWait, let me check that computation again because 3*29524 seems a bit large, and I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 3*29524 more carefully.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Okay, that seems correct. So, the next layer is 88573.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that. First, 3*88573.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n80000 * 3 = 240000\n\n8000 * 3 = 24000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n70 * 3 = 210\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nAdding them together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nThen, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, the next layer is 265720.\n\nWait, but I thought there were nine layers. Let me recount how many layers I've processed so far. Starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. Wait, but in my initial count, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) I can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count them: each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3(1+3( adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\n- The first is 3(1+3(...))\n- Then inside that, 1+3(1+3(...))\n- So each time it's another 1+3(...\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" introduces another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n4. 1+3(1+3(...\n5. 1+3(1+3(...\n6. 1+3(1+3(...\n7. 1+3(1+3(...\n8. 1+3(1+3(...\n9. 1+3(1+3...\n\nWait, so there are nine layers in total. So, when I computed up to 265720, that would be the ninth layer. So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by that result. Wait, no, the outermost layer is 3 times the result of the innermost expression. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ...)), with nine layers. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working outwards, each step I took was moving one layer out. So, after processing nine layers, I reach the outermost expression, which is 3*(result of the ninth layer). Wait, no, because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after processing all nine inner layers, the outermost is 3 times that result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I started with the innermost layer as 1 + 3, which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, which would be the outermost 1 + 3*(...). So, after processing layer 9, which is 1 + 3*265720, that would give me the result inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's structure it properly. The expression is:\n\n3 * [1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))]\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 4, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, in my earlier calculation, I went up to 265720, but maybe I overcounted the layers. Let me recount the layers correctly.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step, ensuring that I don't skip any.\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, after processing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was processing the layers, I thought I reached 265720, but that seems to have been a miscalculation. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nIn my initial step-by-step, I went beyond nine layers, which was incorrect. The correct approach is to process only nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from the innermost. So, after nine layers, the result is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n4. 1+3(1+3(...\n5. 1+3(1+3(...\n6. 1+3(1+3(...\n7. 1+3(1+3(...\n8. 1+3(1+3(...\n9. 1+3(1+3...\n\nSo, there are nine instances of \"1+3(\", which means there are nine layers. Therefore, after processing nine layers, I should stop at 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, let me redo the layers correctly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had nine layers, I went up to 29524, but in my initial processing, I went beyond that, which was a mistake. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this computation once more to be sure. It's easy to make a multiplication error, especially with larger numbers.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, with a_1 = 4, we can compute up to a_9.\n\nLet me compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the result again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence.\n\nFirst, let's find B by setting the recurrence equal:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nBut the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition. Let's say n=1: a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation formula confirms the result again, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we can compute the result more efficiently without having to manually compute each layer step by step, although in this case, since there are only nine layers, the step-by-step approach was manageable.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

    "text": " Let me try to evaluate this step by step, starting from the innermost part. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out gives me 13. Now, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer gives me 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, that's interesting. 121 is 11 squared, but maybe that's just a coincidence. Let's continue. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving on. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Wow, that's a big number. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Hmm, 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. That's a pretty large number. Now, moving to the next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's the next layer. Now, moving out one more layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step builds upon the previous one, and the final result is 265719. I think that's the answer, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me recount each step briefly:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYes, each step seems correct. I didn't skip any layers, and each multiplication and addition looks accurate. So, I feel confident that the final answer is indeed 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer involves multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. Following this step-by-step approach, the final result is computed as 265719.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " Since each layer is similar, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, since the innermost is the last one, let me correct that: the innermost is the ninth layer, and the outermost is the first layer. So, maybe I should compute starting from the ninth layer and work my way up. Let me try that. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, L9: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have L8: 1 + 3*(L9). Since L9 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L8 is 13. Next, L7: 1 + 3*(L8). L8 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, L7 is 40. Moving outward to L6: 1 + 3*(L7). L7 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, L6 is 121. Next, L5: 1 + 3*(L6). L6 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, L5 is 364. Continuing outward, L4: 1 + 3*(L5). L5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, L4 is 1093. Next, L3: 1 + 3*(L4). L4 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, L3 is 3280. Moving outward to L2: 1 + 3*(L3). L3 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L2 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer, L1: 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L1 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(L1). So, after computing L1 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me compute that carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing any of the L1 to L9. Let me go through each step again:\n\nL9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a certain formula. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4. Wait, actually, in my earlier computation, a_9 was 4, a_8 was 13, and so on up to a_1 being 29524. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, c = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the initial term is a_1 = 4, and the number of terms is 9 layers. So, perhaps we can find a formula for a_n in terms of n.\n\nLet me write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Then, to find a general formula for a_n, we can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, which is the outermost layer (since we started from a_1 as the innermost), a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our earlier computation, a_1 was 4, which corresponds to n=1, so a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer, which is a_1 in our earlier computation, corresponds to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems contradictory. Because in our earlier approach, a_1 was the innermost layer, which was 4, and a_9 was the outermost layer, which we computed as 29524. But according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer step by step. Since the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the step-by-step computation, let me recompute a few layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nL7:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nL6:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nL4:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nL3:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nL2:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nL1:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Perfect.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, L3 would be 1 + 3*(L2). So, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's continue this way. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Because the entire expression is 3 times that big nested thing. So, the total value would be 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when doing repetitive steps, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let's see. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, though, the initial term is L1 = 4, and the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, here, a = 3, b = 1, and the initial term is L1 = 4. Let me see if I can model this correctly. Let's define the recurrence as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. So, to find L_n, we can use the formula for a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's proceed. So, the general solution is L_n = L_p + L_n^h = -1/2 + C*3^n. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = -1/2 + C*3^1 => 4 = -1/2 + 3C => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n = -1/2 + (3^{n+1})/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = -1/2 + (3^{2})/2 = -1/2 + 9/2 = ( -1 + 9 ) / 2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = -1/2 + (3^3)/2 = -1/2 + 27/2 = ( -1 + 27 ) / 2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L3 = -1/2 + (3^4)/2 = -1/2 + 81/2 = ( -1 + 81 ) / 2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = -1/2 + (3^{10})/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = -1/2 + 59049/2 = ( -1 + 59049 ) / 2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again, maybe using a different notation or approach. Alternatively, I can think of this as repeatedly multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a geometric series. Let's see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding the entire expression, starting from the innermost: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this. Let's denote the innermost as A = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outwards: 3*A = 3*4 = 12. Then, next layer: 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Next: 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 3*121 = 363. Next: 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 3*364 = 1092. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, 3*1093 = 3279. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, 3*3280 = 9840. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, 3*9841 = 29523. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, after multiple methods and checks, I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a rapid increase in the value. I think I've covered all the steps and verified the result thoroughly, so I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and then working my way outwards, calculating each layer as I go. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost one. So, L9: 1 + 3. Then L8: 1 + 3*(L9). L7: 1 + 3*(L8). And so on, until L1: 1 + 3*(L2), and then the entire expression is 3*(L1). Hmm, that seems manageable. So, if I compute each layer starting from L9, I can substitute the value into the next layer. Let me start with L9: L9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to L8: L8 = 1 + 3*(L9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L8 = 13. Next, L7: L7 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, L7 = 40. Moving on to L6: L6 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Therefore, L6 = 121. Next, L5: L5 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Well, 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, L5 = 364. Now, L4: L4 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364. Hmm, 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, L4 = 1093. Moving on to L3: L3 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, L3 = 3280. Next, L2: L2 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L2 = 9841. Finally, L1: L1 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L1 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L1), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from L9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I did that correctly. Each step built upon the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations as I went along.

    "text": " Starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and moving outward, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe I need to adjust my labeling. Let me think again. The outermost operation is 3*(something), where that something is 1 + 3*(another something). So, perhaps it's better to consider each step as starting from the innermost and working outward, each time computing the value inside the parentheses before moving to the next layer. Let me try that approach. Let's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Next layer out, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Continuing this way, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, I can compute it as 29524*3. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, 7; carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, 7; carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a formula, especially since I might make a mistake in deriving the formula. So, I think my step-by-step computation is solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me look again. The innermost part is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. Wait, no, wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (ones). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so 7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers, so Layer 9 is the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach backs it up. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

    "text": " Therefore, I think the strategy is to compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let's compute that first. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, each time I compute a layer, I'm effectively reducing the number of parentheses by one. Let me count how many layers I've computed so far.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, I end up with 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times that entire expression, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost nine layers, which gives me 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify by another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Each time I computed a layer, I added 1 to 3 times the previous result. So, starting from the innermost, which was 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nLet me check each step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each layer's value.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} because n=9 corresponds to 3^{10} in the formula. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. I think I've double-checked it enough times, and each step seems correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward, eventually multiplying the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the innermost expression**: The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. **Compute each subsequent layer**: Each layer is 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer). \n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let me label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward is Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3 multiplication. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving outward to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently would be better. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. It looks like each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a rapid increase. So, I think I did each step correctly. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

By systematically evaluating each layer, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

So, let's define each layer as follows:\n\n- The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

So, I think the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be seen as adding 1 and then scaling the rest by 3. If I expand the entire expression, it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nBut since each layer is nested, it's a bit more involved. However, using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nIn any case, both methods led me to the same result, so I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer adds another 3 times a term. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation method, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern, leading to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer (Layer 9):\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since there's no more parentheses inside) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, okay. Let me compute each layer one by one. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was straightforward. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Okay, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121, let's compute that: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Therefore, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Got it. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Therefore, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to verify. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that seems correct. So, I think I did that right.

So perhaps the first operation is 3 times something, which itself is 1 plus 3 times another something, etc. Let me try to parse this correctly. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count the number of layers.

Each layer builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1.

I think I did it correctly. Let me just check if I counted the layers right. The original expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. Yes, that's correct.

Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nAdd 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me check each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, seems like each step checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident in this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst Layer (innermost):\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSecond Layer:\n1 + 3*(First Layer) = 1 + 3*4\n\nThird Layer:\n1 + 3*(Second Layer) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)\n\nWait, maybe it's better if I compute each layer step by step and write down each value. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of layers. Let me count again to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so I should have 9 layers. Let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 gives me 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that. 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, I can break this down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that multiplication again because 3*29524 is a big number, and I might have made a mistake in breaking it down.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but when I added up the parts earlier, I got 88572, which matches the direct multiplication. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm using another method. Maybe using calculator-like steps:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I added up the broken-down parts earlier, I had:\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n3*500=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n3*20=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n3*4=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure that I correctly identified the layers. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nYes, that's nine layers, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the initial problem has exactly nine layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, how many are there? Let's see:\n\nAfter 3, the first ( is at position 2: 3(\n\nThen, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, actually, from the expression, I can see that each time it's 3(, so starting from the first, there are 9 instances of 3(, which would mean 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach could be used here, recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence, we can model it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's test this formula with our earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2713\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2713\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2713\n\nGood, the formula works for the first few layers. So, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2713\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me confirm that 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 3^9 * 3 = 19683 * 3 = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a linear recurrence than a straightforward geometric series.\n\nBut in any case, using the recurrence approach and the closed-form formula both lead me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n4. After computing up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation and verify that it gives the same Layer 9 value.\n\n6. Multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThroughout this process, I made sure to double-check each step, especially the multiplication and the exponentiation, to avoid any arithmetic errors. It's easy to make a mistake with large numbers, so taking it step by step and verifying each part helps ensure accuracy.\n\nI also considered whether there might be a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation, and indeed, recognizing the linear recurrence allowed me to express Layer n in terms of a closed-form formula, which not only saved time but also provided a way to verify the result.\n\nIn summary, the problem required careful, step-by-step computation from the innermost parentheses outward, either by iterative computation or by deriving a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. Both approaches led to the same result, confirming that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Maybe I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 =4:\n\na1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost part outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. We can compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final computation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The result of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so that layer becomes 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times 13. So, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, that's 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Wow, that's getting big quickly. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Wow, that's a jump. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let's see, 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. Whoa, that's almost 1,100. Next layer: 1 + 3*1,093. Calculating that: 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. Wow, that's almost 3,300. Next: 1 + 3*3,280. Let me compute that: 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Wow, that's over 9,000. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9,841. So, 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 3*29,524 is 88,572, plus 1 is 88,573. Now, remember, all of that is inside the very first set of parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, the entire expression is 3 times 88,573. Let me calculate that: 3*88,573. Hmm, 88,573 times 3. Let me break it down: 80,000*3 is 240,000. 8,000*3 is 24,000. 500*3 is 1,500. 70*3 is 210. 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500. 265,500 + 210 is 265,710. 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the entire expression inside the outermost 3(...). Then, the final result would be 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Proceeding to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, maybe it's correct. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence relation is known. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*(a)^n, where C is a constant. The particular solution is a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = k, where k is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: k = a*k + b => k = 3k + 1 => 0 = 2k +1 => k = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. What's L_1? From earlier, L_1=4. So, L_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression, which might be more efficient for larger numbers of layers. But since in this case, there are nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's easy to see how a formula would be preferable if the number of layers were much larger. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and realized that each layer could be computed sequentially from the innermost outwards. I defined each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} and computed each one step by step up to L_9. Then, I found a closed-form formula for L_n using the recurrence relation, which allowed me to compute L_9 directly and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors, as I double-checked each step and even used a different method to confirm the result. So, I think I'm good here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, we find that \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the next layer is 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 12. That should be 13. Let me write that down: 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer out, we have 3*(13). So, 3*13 is 39. Then, moving out, we add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. Next layer: 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Next, 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Next, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.

But that can't be right because the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...) terms, each time adding another layer. So, perhaps each time, you're doing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(result from previous layer). Let me try that.\n\nLet me list each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 3*(Step 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nStep 3: 1 + Step 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 4: 3*(Step 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nStep 5: 1 + Step 4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 6: 3*(Step 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nStep 7: 1 + Step 6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 8: 3*(Step 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nStep 9: 1 + Step 8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 10: 3*(Step 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nStep 11: 1 + Step 10 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 12: 3*(Step 11) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nStep 13: 1 + Step 12 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 14: 3*(Step 13) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nStep 15: 1 + Step 14 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 16: 3*(Step 15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but the original expression only has nine layers. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n10. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n11. 1 + 3*(...)\n12. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n13. 1 + 3*(...)\n14. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n15. 1 + 3*(...)\n16. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 16 layers, but in the original expression, each \"1 + 3(\" is followed by another layer until the ninth one. So, perhaps the number of layers is nine, each corresponding to one \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3(...))\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(...)\n4. Then, 3*(1 + 3(...))\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(...)\n6. Then, 3*(1 + 3(...))\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(...)\n8. Then, 3*(1 + 3(...))\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(...)\n10. Then, 3*(1 + 3(...))\n11.

Then, 3*(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 16 layers, but the original expression only has nine \"1 + 3(\" instances. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer, so the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then, each time you go out, you have another layer. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances:\n\n1.

Alternatively, perhaps each time you add a layer, you're adding one more \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, computing each layer step by step, regardless of how many layers there are.\n\nLet me try that approach. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer 11: 1 + Layer 10 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 12: 3*(Layer 11) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer 13: 1 + Layer 12 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 14: 3*(Layer 13) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nLayer 15: 1 + Layer 14 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 16: 3*(Layer 15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so that's 16 layers, but the original expression only has nine \"1 + 3(\" instances. Hmm, maybe the initial count was wrong. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n10. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n11. 1 + 3*(...)\n12. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n13. 1 + 3*(...)\n14. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n15. 1 + 3*(...)\n16. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n\nNo, that's 16 layers, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of parentheses. Let me count the total number of opening parentheses.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" is an opening parenthesis. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first \"3(\", then each \"1+3(\" adds another.\n\nSo:\n\n1. 3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, that's nine \"1+3(\" instances, each adding another layer. So, the innermost is the ninth layer, and then each layer is built outward. Therefore, the total number of layers is nine. So, perhaps my earlier counting was wrong because I included the initial 3( as a layer, but maybe that's not necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3( is the outermost layer, and then each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 1092\n\nLayer 11: 1 + Layer 10 = 1093\n\nLayer 12: 3*(Layer 11) = 3279\n\nLayer 13: 1 + Layer 12 = 3280\n\nLayer 14: 3*(Layer 13) = 9840\n\nLayer 15: 1 + Layer 14 = 9841\n\nLayer 16: 3*(Layer 15) = 29523\n\nWait, that's 16 layers, but the original expression only has nine \"1 + 3(\" instances. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each time I go out a layer, I'm adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\nLet me list the layers as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9, which would be 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match my earlier result of 29523. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is the outermost layer after all the nested 1 + 3*(...) terms. So, if I have nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), then Layer 9 would be the result of the ninth 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire expression is 3*Layer 9.\n\nWait, so perhaps I have to compute nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), each time using the previous result, and then multiply the ninth layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nCompute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems different from my previous calculation. But now I'm confused because earlier I thought the final result was 29523, but now it's 88572. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 3 multiplied by a term that has nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, each of those nine layers is a 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final result was 29523, which was Layer 9 before multiplying by 3. So, perhaps I had a misunderstanding of how many layers there are.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n10. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n11. 1 + 3*(...)\n12. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n13. 1 + 3*(...)\n14. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n15. 1 + 3*(...)\n16. 3*(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 16 layers, but the original expression only has nine \"1 + 3(\" instances. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the expression has nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, Layer 1 to Layer 9 are the 1 + 3*(...) terms, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, the final result is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer, and the outermost 3* is also a layer, making it 10 layers in total. But that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as follows:\n\nThe expression is 3*(A), where A is 1 + 3*(B), where B is 1 + 3*(C), and so on, until the innermost term, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nTerm1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTerm2: 1 + 3*Term1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nTerm3: 1 + 3*Term2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nTerm4: 1 + 3*Term3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nTerm5: 1 + 3*Term4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nTerm6: 1 + 3*Term5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nTerm7: 1 + 3*Term6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nTerm8: 1 + 3*Term7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nTerm9: 1 + 3*Term8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Term9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the result was 29523, but that was before multiplying by the outermost 3. So, perhaps I had miscounted the layers before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression is 3*(Term9), where Term9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example to see if the pattern holds.\n\nSuppose we have a smaller expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*4 = 12\n\nNext: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 3*13 = 39\n\nNext: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but in this smaller example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but that's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, using the layer approach:\n\nTerm1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTerm2: 1 + 3*Term1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nTerm3: 1 + 3*Term2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, the expression is 3*Term3 = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich matches the manual computation.\n\nSimilarly, if we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), that's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nUsing the layer approach:\n\nTerm1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTerm2: 1 + 3*Term1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nExpression: 3*Term2 = 39.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, which has nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), followed by the outermost 3*.\n\nSo, Term1: 4\n\nTerm2: 13\n\nTerm3: 40\n\nTerm4: 121\n\nTerm5: 364\n\nTerm6: 1093\n\nTerm7: 3280\n\nTerm8: 9841\n\nTerm9: 29524\n\nThen, the expression is 3*Term9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 29523, which was Term9, but that was before the outermost multiplication by 3. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the entire expression is 3*(Term9), not just Term9.\n\nSo, the correct final answer should be 88572.\n\nLet me double-check the computation for Term9.\n\nTerm1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nTerm2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nTerm3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nTerm4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nTerm5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nTerm6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nTerm7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nTerm8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nTerm"

    "text": " To tackle this, I'll start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which will be the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3*(something). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. Let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems right. So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time substituting the result into the next layer. Let me try to compute each layer one by one. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Wait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's result is calculated as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n\\boxed{88572}"
