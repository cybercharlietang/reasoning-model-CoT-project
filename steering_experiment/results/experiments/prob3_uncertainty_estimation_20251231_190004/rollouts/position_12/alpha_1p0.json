    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try to outline each step: Let's denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, and then finally multiply by 3. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start from the innermost parentheses. Innermost Layer (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if there's a formula I can apply here. The general form of a geometric series is a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). But in this case, the expression is nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^(p) = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, same as before. So, using both iterative computation and the formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the final multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try starting from the innermost part and work my way out. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going step by step. The next layer is 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Then, 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093 first. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, moving to the next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step simplifies the expression until we get to the final result, which is 88572. Let me just quickly verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, and finally 3*29524=88572. Each step seems to follow logically, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward, each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. Repeating this process for each layer leads to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Work Outwards Layer by Layer:**\n   - Each subsequent layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{result from previous layer})\\).\n   - Compute each layer step by step:\n     - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n     - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n     - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n     - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n     - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n     - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n     - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n     - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n     - Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe if I start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and work my way out, it'll be manageable. Let me try that. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, starting from the innermost. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27, carryover 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27, carryover 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should just do it the straightforward way: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*(Level 9) = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I'm not sure if I did the multiplication correctly. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next digit: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply, I should have 5 digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n```\n    2 9 5 2 4\n  x        3\n-------------\n```\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the levels. Level 1: 4, Level 2: 13, Level 3: 40, Level 4: 121, Level 5: 364, Level 6: 1093, Level 7: 3280, Level 8: 9841, Level 9: 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check one of the levels again. Let's pick Level 5: Level 4 was 121, so Level 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct. Similarly, Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all levels check out. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each level is computed by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward. By calculating each level step by step, we find that the expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Wait, is that a pattern? Let me check. So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*(4) = 13.

So, writing it out: 88,573 * 3: 3*3=9, write down 9. 3*7=21, write down 1, carry over 2. 3*5=15, plus 2 carried over is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 3*8=24, plus 1 carried over is 25, write down 5, carry over 2. 3*8=24, plus 2 carried over is 26, write down 6, carry over 2. There are no more digits, so write down the 2. So, the result is 265,719. Yep, that's correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 265,719. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so maybe Layer 1 is the innermost 1 + 3, and Layer 9 is the outermost one. So, perhaps I should compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Let me try that approach. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 is 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. So Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let me compute a few more layers to see if there's a pattern or a formula that I can apply. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 is 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 is 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, so putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure that I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The problem starts with 3(1+3(1+3(...))) So, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire inner expression. So, if I have 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), and each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count how many times 1+3 appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time moving outward, each 1+3 is a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had 9 layers, but when I evaluated, I only went up to Layer9 as 29524, but let me check the expression again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's see: Each time, it's 1+3(....). How many times does this happen?\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time you go outward, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs, each time multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 1+3, each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3=1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9, then the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be 3*(L9), where L9 is the result of the innermost expression up to Layer9. So, perhaps my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers or 8 layers. Because sometimes when you count the number of layers, you might miscount.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, moving outward, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears:\n\n1. 1+3 (innermost)\n\n2. 1+3(...)\n\n3. 1+3(...)\n\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each time you have a 1+3(, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 such terms. So, Layer1 is 1+3, Layer2 is 1+3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer9.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute L9 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost: Let\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, since the innermost is the last one, which is 1 + 3, so maybe I should start from there. Let me try to compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost expression:\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Let me note that down as L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3(L2). Substituting L2 = 13, we get 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3(L3). Substituting L3 = 40, we have 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(L4). Substituting L4 = 121, this becomes 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Therefore, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3(L5). Substituting L5 = 364, this is 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, we have 1 + 3(L6). Substituting L6 = 1093, this becomes 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Therefore, L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3(L7). Substituting L7 = 3280, this becomes 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3(L8). Substituting L8 = 9841, this becomes 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 1 + 29523 = 29524. Therefore, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this outermost layer, which is L9. So, the original expression is 3*L9. Substituting L9 = 29524, we get 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, then 87000 + 1500 = 88500, and 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, moving one layer out: 3*(innermost layer) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the structure again. Each expression is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me label each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the layers go from 1 to 9, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is 29524, as calculated.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found as follows.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nParticular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer).\n3. Continue this process for each layer up to the ninth layer.\n4. Multiply the result of the ninth layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe if I start solving from the innermost part, it'll be easier. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, let's compute that first. (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, substituting the innermost result, we have 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next level is 13. Now, moving out another level, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, that level is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing that each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So, maybe I can generalize this as a recursive process. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here. Let's denote each level as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Continuing this way, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, let me check that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, a\u2085 is 364. Then, a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, a\u2086 is 1093. Next, a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, a\u2087 is 3280. Moving on, a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, a\u2088 is 9841. Finally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, a\u2089 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(a\u2089). Wait, no, actually, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on, with nine levels. So, each a_i corresponds to the inner expressions, and the outermost is 3 times a\u2089. Wait, but in my sequence above, a\u2089 is the result of the innermost nine levels. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many levels of 1 + 3*(...) are there? Let's count the opening parentheses after the 3: Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one level. Then each time we go out, we add another level. So, let me count: Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first level. Then moving out, each 1 + 3*(...) adds another level. So, from the innermost, each layer adds one more level. So, in the original expression, how many times do we have 1 + 3*(...)? Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is one level, and each time we go out, we add another level. Let's count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions. Let me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, from the innermost, each layer is a new a_i. So, the innermost is a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, because there are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, let me check that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1 + 3*(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one. Then each time we go out, it's another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many are there? Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 level 1\n2. (1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 level 2\n3. (1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 level 3\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...) expressions. Each time we have a new opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(layer1)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. (1 + 3*(layer2)) \u2192 layer3\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression after the initial 3 is 1 + 3*(...), and each time we go in, we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3*, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...))\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. (1 + 3*(...))\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. (1 + 3*(...))\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n10. (1 + 3)\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers after the initial 3. Wait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Let me confirm: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we add a layer, we go up. So, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3*, we have (1 + 3*(...\n2. Then another (1 + 3*(...\n3. Another (1 + 3*(...\n4. Another (1 + 3*(...\n5. Another (1 + 3*(...\n6. Another (1 + 3*(...\n7. Another (1 + 3*(...\n8. Another (1 + 3*(...\n9. Another (1 + 3*(...\n10. And finally, the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, that seems like 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to a\u2089 as 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought a\u2089 was 29524, which is the result of the innermost 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a\u2089), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. Because in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, if the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 40, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 121, a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 364, a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1093, a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 3280, a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 9841, a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the count might be one more or one less. Let me verify by computing a few layers manually.\n\nCompute the innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the innermost expression, Layer9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the original expression is 3*(Layer9) or if Layer9 is the innermost, and the expression is 3*(Layer9). Yes, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is the innermost expression, which we computed as Layer9 = 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the number of times 1 + 3*(...) appears. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is one layer, and each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. So, starting from the initial 3*, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...\n2. (1 + 3*(...\n3. (1 + 3*(...\n4. (1 + 3*(...\n5. (1 + 3*(...\n6. (1 + 3*(...\n7. (1 + 3*(...\n8. (1 + 3*(...\n9. (1 + 3*(...\n10. (1 + 3)\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, so that would imply 9 layers. Wait, but when I counted earlier, I thought the innermost was layer1, then each layer adds one, so with 9 layers, a\u2089 is the innermost. But in the original expression, it's 3*(layer9). So, maybe my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Let me consider that each time I go in, I'm adding another layer, so the innermost is layer1, and the outermost is layer9. So, the value of the entire expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is the innermost.\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer1, then each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, if there are nine layers, then the innermost is layer1, and the outermost is layer9, which is 3*(layer9). So, that would mean that the value is 3*(a\u2089), where a\u2089 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's say we have a similar expression with only two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the entire expression is 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, computing directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. Let me compute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with nine layers, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result), up to layer9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation of 3*29524 again to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer1, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), up to layer9, which is the innermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, that would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B.\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSolve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10} again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. I've checked each step, and the formula seems to hold. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern $a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}$, starting with $a_1 = 4$. Using the recurrence relation and solving for each subsequent layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times 13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer gives me 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, interesting. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that. 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. Okay, so that's 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's see, 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so adding those together gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer out: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524. Moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that's 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, putting it all together, the final result is 265,719. Wait a second, that seems really big. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Next, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265,719. Hmm, seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and each time I multiplied by 3 and added 1. It looks like each layer is growing exponentially, which is why the final number is so large. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 265,719.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Finally: 3*88573 = 265719\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by solving the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's try that. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next level out is 13. Let me note that down. Now, moving another level out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so now we have 40. Continuing this process, the next level would be 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that's interesting. 121 is 11 squared. I wonder if there's a pattern here with powers of 3 or something else. Let's keep going. Next level: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Hmm, 364. Not sure if that's a familiar number. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. So far, starting from the innermost parentheses, the results are 4, 13, 40, 121, 364...

Finally, the outermost layer would be 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me recount to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the first 3, it's followed by (1 + 3(...)). Each time, there's another 3 and another set of parentheses. So, how many times does this happen? Let me see: After the first 3, there are 9 more layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, total layers are 10? Wait, no. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous). So, if there are 9 layers after the initial 3, then total layers are 10? Hmm, I might be confusing myself here. Let me try to parse the expression properly. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the first 3, each subsequent term is another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I have n layers, the result would be built up by n steps. Let me see, in the original expression, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then another 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, from the structure, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I have nine 3*(...) terms, that would mean that I have ten layers, right? Because each 3*(...) adds a layer. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is one layer. Then each 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3*(...) terms. So, in the given expression, starting from the first 3, each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3*(...)), so each 3 adds a layer. Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent 3 is inside another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many 3*(...) terms are there? Let me see:\n\n1. The first 3*(1 + ...)\n2. Then another 3*(1 + ...)\n3. Continuing until the innermost 3*(1 + 3).\n\nSo, if I count the number of 3*(...) terms, it's equal to the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), which adds another 3*(...) term. So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3*(...))\n- Then, inside that, another 3*(...)\n- And so on, until the innermost 3*(1 + 3).\n\nSo, if I have nine 3*(...) terms, then the innermost is the ninth, and the outermost is the first. Wait, no, because each 3*(...) is a layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of 3*(...) terms. Let me try to count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12; but no, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each 1 + 3*(previous) is another layer.\n\nSo, if the innermost is layer 1, then each time we go out, it's layer 2, 3, etc. So, the original expression has how many layers? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 (Layer 10)\n\nWait, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Let me check that. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) => 1\n2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...)) => 2\n3. And so on until the ninth one.\n\nWait, so starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds another layer. So, the innermost is the ninth layer. So, actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the total number of layers is nine. So, my earlier count was incorrect because I was adding an extra layer.\n\nSo, let me recount with nine layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nSo, after nine layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(this result). So, the final step is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial counting, I went up to Layer 10, but that was incorrect because the original expression only has nine layers. So, the correct approach is to compute nine layers, starting from the innermost, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nSo, let's make sure. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, with nine layers, the computation is as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, we reach 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the multiplication step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nYes, nine layers, so the result is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the entire expression is 3 times the result of the nine-layer computation. So, the nine layers give us 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can directly compute a_n without having to compute each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only requires up to n=9, computing step by step is manageable, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's start from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me write down each step as I go along:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean I have to compute nine layers? Let me check the original expression again to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It looks like there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, I have to compute each layer step by step, nine times. So, the first step is (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent step uses the result from the previous step. So, as I did before, step 1: 4, step 2: 13, step 3: 40, step 4: 121, step 5: 364, step 6: 1093, step 7: 3280, step 8: 9841, step 9: 29524.\n\nWait, so after nine layers, the innermost expression becomes 29524. Then, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again: each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1, right? So, it's a recursive process where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. If I have a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Let's define each layer as follows: Let me number the innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, since the innermost is Layer 1, and each layer wraps around the previous one. So, starting from Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 ( ) But actually, in the given expression, the innermost part is (1+3), right? Because the innermost parentheses is just (1+3), without any further nesting.

Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), but in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, if Layer 9 is the innermost, then Layer 9 is (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), which we computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: The innermost parentheses is (1+3), which is Layer 1: 4. Then, moving outward, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Let me verify each step to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) *3 = 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...). Each time, we have a new opening parenthesis until the innermost (1+3). Let me count how many times the pattern (1+3( occurs. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3( is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nThen, after the ninth (, we have 1+3), which is the innermost. So, there are nine layers of (1+3(...). Therefore, Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final 3 multiplier. Therefore, the computation as I did earlier is correct, leading to 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a formulaic way to compute this without having to compute each layer manually? Maybe recognizing a pattern or using a geometric series? Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without manually computing each layer. That's a good way to confirm the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form formula to compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4.\n\n2. **Solve the recurrence relation**: The general solution for L_n is found to be L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n3. **Compute for n=9**: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

I can break it down as 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is E1 = 1+3, then E2 is 1+3*E1, and so on up to E9, which is the outermost. But in the original expression, it's 3*(E9). So, when I calculated E1 through E9, that should be correct, right? Because each step is one more layer out. So, E9 is 29524, and then 3*E9 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the E steps. Let me go through each E again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. Maybe I can try a different approach to confirm. Let's consider that each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution E_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u21d2 9/2 = 3A \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: E4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: E5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: E6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: E7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: E8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: E9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for each E_n. Therefore, E9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, E9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next until we reach the outermost layer. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost (E1) to the outermost (E9).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * E9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Maybe I should start by solving the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let's compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, that level gives me 13. Moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, 40. Now, the next level out is 1 + 3 times 40. Let me compute 3*40 first: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, 121? That seems like a square number, which is interesting. Let me keep that in mind. Moving out another level, the expression is 1 + 3 times 121. So, 3*121 is... let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, 364. Next level out: 1 + 3 times 364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's a big number. Moving out another level, we have 1 + 3 times 1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next level out: 1 + 3 times 3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Hmm, 9841. That looks familiar. Isn't that a square number? Let me check: 99 squared is 9801, and 100 squared is 10000. Wait, 99 squared is 9801, so 99^2 = 9801. Then, 99^2 + 120 = 9801 + 120 = 9921, which is not 9841. Wait, maybe it's 99 squared plus something else? Alternatively, perhaps it's 99.2 squared or something, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just note that 9841 is the result of this step. Moving out another level, the expression is 1 + 3 times 9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wow, that's a huge number. Now, moving out to the outermost level, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, it's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies down to 88572. Wait, let me just verify that I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Let me go through each step again briefly. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent each time I go through it. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each step manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each level is 1 + 3 times the next level. So, if I let each level be a term, say, a_1, a_2, a_3, etc., then each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say, C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I calculated earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works for each step. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3(...) is a_9 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, this gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for a_n to compute a_9 directly without computing each step. Let me try that: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to approach it. It's interesting that the formula gives the same result, and it's much faster, especially if the expression had more nested levels. But for this problem, since there are nine levels, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming. I think the key takeaway here is recognizing the pattern and identifying that it's a recurrence relation that can be solved with a formula, which can save a lot of time, especially for larger expressions. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a general formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by solving the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. Let's say the innermost is the 9th one, and the outermost is the 1st one. So, starting with the 9th parentheses: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, the 8th parentheses would be 1 + 3*(result from 9th parentheses). Since the 9th gave us 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so the 8th parentheses equals 13. Now, moving out to the 7th parentheses: 1 + 3*(result from 8th). The 8th was 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. So, 7th is 40. Continuing this way, the 6th parentheses: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, 6th is 121. Next, the 5th parentheses: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 5th is 364. Moving on to the 4th parentheses: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, 4th is 1093. Now, the 3rd parentheses: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, 3rd is 3280. Then, the 2nd parentheses: 1 + 3*(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, 2nd is 9841. Finally, the outermost, the 1st parentheses: 1 + 3*(9841). 3*9841 is... let me calculate that. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*(9841) is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each step manually. Let me think about that. Each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost is a_9 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, and so on up to a_1, which is the outermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3*a_2, and then the entire expression is 3*a_1. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost is a_9 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until a_1. So, actually, the number of terms is 9, starting from a_9 up to a_1. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost is a_9 = 4, so maybe a_n is defined from n=9 down to n=1. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to index it from n=1 to n=9, where a_1 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Wait, no, that might not be correct because each step is moving outward, so perhaps it's better to think of it as a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me try to write down the terms:\n\na_1 = 4 (innermost)\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which equals 3*a_9. So, that's where the 3*29524 comes from, giving 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, since the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_9. So, a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think this makes sense. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula helped me confirm the result without having to compute each step manually, which is good because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple steps manually. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each term follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost expression, we compute \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\), where \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try to compute the innermost part first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next level out is 13. Now, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that level is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me check if that's consistent. Next, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Wait a second, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121... These seem like they could be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: 4, 13, 40, 121... If I check the ratios between them: 13/4 = 3.25, 40/13 \u2248 3.077, 121/40 = 3.025. Hmm, not exactly a constant ratio, but they're getting closer to 3 each time. Maybe that's a coincidence. Alternatively, perhaps each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me test that. Starting with 4: 3*4 + 1 = 13, yes. Then 3*13 + 1 = 40, correct. 3*40 + 1 = 121, right. So, each term is indeed 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me define a sequence where a_n is the value of the nth expression from the inside out. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, I need to compute a_9, then multiply by 3 to get the final result. To compute a_9, I can either compute each term step by step up to a_9 or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a closed-form formula because that would be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, which is the number of layers we have, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Therefore, a_9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29000 * 3 = 87000, 524 * 3 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I identified that the expression is a nested recurrence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. I defined a sequence a_n where a_1 = 4, and each subsequent a_n is 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Then, I found the closed-form formula for a_n using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. I verified the formula with the initial terms, which matched, so that gave me confidence it was correct. Then, I computed a_9 using the formula, which gave me 29524. Finally, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, I could compute each layer step by step without using the formula to see if I get the same result. Let me try that as a check. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms that my answer is correct. I think I've got it.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost part before the final multiplication by 3. Hmm, but actually, looking again, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So maybe each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So we have 3 * 29524. Let's compute that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, but that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88572. So putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that. Let me start by labeling each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression, multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(something), where that something is 1 + 3*(another something), and so on. So, perhaps I should compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let's try that. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. So, 300 + 60 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then add 1: 363 + 1 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently would be easier. Let me compute 3*29524 directly. 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it step by step. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\nNext digit: 9 (the next digit after 2) * 3 = 27, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with so many layers.

    "text": " Maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost part and moving outwards. Let's denote each inner expression as a separate variable to make it easier, but since I'm just working through it manually, I'll compute each step one by one. Let me number the innermost expression as step 1, then work my way out to step 9. So, starting with the innermost parentheses: Step 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, step 1 result is 4. Now, moving one step out, we have another expression: Step 2: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, step 2 result is 13. Next step out, step 3: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Step 3 result is 40. Moving on, step 4: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Step 4 result is 121. Step 5: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Step 5 result is 364. Step 6: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). That's 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, step 6 result is 1093. Step 7: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Step 7 result is 3280. Step 8: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). That's 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Step 8 result is 9841. Finally, step 9: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, step 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from step 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my steps quickly to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error somewhere. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Let me write that down: Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Let me note that down: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can write this as a recursive formula. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Continuing this way, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Let me check that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that seems right. Then, a_5 would be 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, a_5 = 364. Next, a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, a_6 = 1093. Moving on, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, a_7 = 3280. Next, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, a_8 = 9841. Finally, a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, a_9 = 29524. Now, after computing all the layers, the outermost part of the expression is 3 times a_9. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: a_1 = 4, that's correct. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, right. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, yes. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, yes. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, right. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, yes. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. I guess another way to look at it is that each layer is following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, each term is growing exponentially, which is why the numbers get big so quickly. It's interesting how each step multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1, leading to such a large number after just nine iterations. I wonder if there's a formula to compute a_n without having to go through each layer, maybe using geometric series or something. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. If it had more layers, I might look for a pattern or a closed-form solution. But for now, I think my step-by-step approach worked fine. So, after computing each layer, the final result is 88,572. I feel confident about this answer because I checked each step, and the calculations seem correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me define each level to make it clearer. Let me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost, and Level 9 is the outermost. So, Level 1: 1 + 3 Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) ... and so on until Level 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3(Level 9), because the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, starting with Level 1: Level 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Then, Level 2 = 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Level 2 is 13. Next, Level 3 = 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Level 3 is 40. Level 4 = 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5 = 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6 = 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7 = 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8 = 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's compute 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, Level 9 = 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Let me add them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when doing arithmetic step by step, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify Level 1 to Level 9 again. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute it again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that correctly. Each level builds on the previous one, and the numbers get pretty big as we go outward, but it's manageable step by step. So, the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here instead of computing each level manually. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of parentheses. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursive expression. Let me think about it. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), but that's just repeating the same structure. Wait, but in this case, the nesting is finite, with nine levels. So, it's not an infinite series but a finite nested expression. If it were infinite, we could express it using a formula, but since it's finite, we have to compute each level step by step as I did earlier. So, I think my initial approach is correct, and there's no shortcut formula applicable here because it's finite. Therefore, my final answer should be 88572. I feel confident about this after double-checking each step.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost part first and then build my way up. Let me try to break it down step by step. Let's denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, starting from the innermost. Level 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Wait, actually, that might not be the best way. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, calculating each step as I go. Let's start with the very innermost part: Level 9: 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one level out, Level 8: 1 + 3(Level 9). Since Level 9 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Level 8 is 13. Moving out to Level 7: 1 + 3(Level 8). Level 8 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Level 7 is 40. Next, Level 6: 1 + 3(Level 7). Level 7 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Level 6 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3(Level 6). Level 6 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 5). Level 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 4 is 1093. Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 4). Level 4 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 3 is 3280. Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 3). Level 3 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 2 is 9841. Finally, Level 1: 1 + 3(Level 2). Level 2 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the innermost part of Level 1 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this Level 1 result. So, the entire original expression is 3*(Level 1), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I do it step by step, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2. 2*3=6, 7. 5*3=15, 5. 9*3=27, 8. 2*3=6, 8. 9*3=27, 7. 2*3=6, 8. So, yeah, 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me check if I did all the steps correctly because that seems like a big number. Let me go back through each level to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting from Level 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Level 1: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. So, after verifying each step, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this process. I notice that each step is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's a recursive kind of sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. Let me denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number starting from the innermost as n=1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Level 1. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand it, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, actually, each level adds another power of 3. Let me check with the formula I derived earlier: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the original expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the sum up to 9 levels, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or model it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and then multiplying by 3 and adding 1 for the next level. This pattern continues until we reach the outermost expression.\n\nBy systematically evaluating each level from the inside out, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent level builds on this result, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine levels, we find that the innermost expression at the ninth level is 29524. \n\nFinally, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThe step-by-step computation confirms that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let's compute that. 3(4) is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(13). Let's compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Continuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3(40). Let's see: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3(121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. Next: 1 + 3(364). Let's calculate 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. That's 9841. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3(9841). Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times this result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. Then 1+3*13=40. Then 1+3*40=121. Then 1+3*121=364. Then 1+3*364=1093. Then 1+3*1093=3280. Then 1+3*3280=9841. Then 1+3*9841=29524. Then 1+3*29524=88573. Finally, 3*88573=265719. Yep, that seems consistent.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me try that. Let's label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. That's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check that with Layer 4. Layer 4 is 1 + 3 times Layer 3. So, 1 + 3*40.

Let's compute that. 3*364 is... let me think. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that's 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. Wow, that's getting bigger quickly. Next: 1 + 3*(121). Let's see, 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then 1 + 265719 = 265720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 265720. Let's compute that: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Wait, that seems off. Let me check my calculation again. 3 * 265,720. Let me compute it step by step: 265,720 * 3. 200,000 * 3 = 600,000. 60,000 * 3 = 180,000. 5,000 * 3 = 15,000. 700 * 3 = 2,100. 20 * 3 = 60. Now, adding them all up: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000. 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000. 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100. 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. Hmm, that's what I got before. But let me confirm if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in one of the inner layers. Let me retrace my steps to see if I messed up any of the calculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. Finally, 3*265720 = 797,160\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the innermost term as a_1, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I had a_9 as 265,720, but according to this, a_9 is 29,524. But then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29,524 = 88,572. But that contradicts my earlier calculation where I ended up with 797,160. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( is a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(... inside:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, a_1 is the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to a_9 as 265,720, which would mean that the total is 3*265,720 = 797,160. But according to the a_1 to a_9 as above, a_9 should be 29,524, leading to 3*a_9 = 88,572. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, there are nine opening parentheses, meaning nine layers. So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so earlier I had computed up to a_9 as 265,720, but that was incorrect because I must have miscounted the layers. So, the correct a_9 is 29,524, leading to 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had more layers, ending up with 797,160, which is clearly wrong now. So, I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me verify again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the first 3 adds a new layer. So, how many are there?\n\nLet's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, nine layers. Therefore, a_1 to a_9 as above.\n\nThus, the correct value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my first computation, I went beyond nine layers, which was incorrect. So, I must have miscounted. Let me try to compute each a_i correctly.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 797,160, which was clearly wrong. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem has more layers than I thought. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, nine layers. Therefore, a_1 to a_9 as above.\n\nThus, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such recursive expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for a_9, n = 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think earlier I must have miscounted the number of layers, leading me to an incorrect result. But now, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I found that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each layer step by step and using a closed-form formula for the recursive sequence, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Maybe I can write each step as a separate computation. Let's start with the innermost expression: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next level is 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next level is 40. Continuing this way, the next expression is 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, now we have 121. Next level up: 1 + 3*121. Calculating that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, the next result is 364. Moving out another level: 1 + 3*364. Let's do the math: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next level: 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1093 is... let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, now we have 3280. Next level up: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, the next result is 9841. Moving out another level: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the next result is 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost level: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, the result here is 88573. Now, remember that each of these steps was inside another set of parentheses, and each time we multiplied by 3 and added 1. But wait, in the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times this big expression. So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result we just got, which is 88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let me break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the final result is 265719. Wait a second, let me verify that because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me double-check the last step. The expression after all the innermost computations was 88573, right? So, 3 times 88573. Let me compute it step by step: 88573 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo, writing it out: 265719. Yes, that seems correct. Hmm, but let me check the previous steps as well to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, so there are 9 sets of parentheses, which means we have 9 levels of computation inside, right? Let me count the number of times I did the 1 + 3*... step. From the innermost, I did 9 steps before multiplying by 3 at the very end. So, the first step was (1+3)=4, then 1+3*4=13, and so on until I got to 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check one of the intermediate steps to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me pick step 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. That seems correct.\n\nAnother step: step 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to check out. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 265719. Hmm, that seems like a large number, but considering the depth of nesting and the multiplicative effect of 3 each time, it might actually be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each step manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error.\n\nWait, let's think about this. Each time, we have an expression of the form 1 + 3*(...), and this is nested multiple times. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence and find a formula for the nth term, then compute it for n=9 (since there are 9 levels of nesting).\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n9/2 = 3A\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, that's the same result as step 10 in my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, hold on, that's different from my initial calculation where I ended up with 265719. Wait, no, in my initial step-by-step, I had 88573 after the innermost 9 steps, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But according to the recurrence relation, a_9 is 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me check the recurrence. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 levels. So, the innermost is (1+3)=4, then each level is 1 + 3*previous. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut according to the recurrence formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step computation, I ended up with 265719. That's a problem because according to the formula, it should be 88572. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount the steps. In my initial computation, I started with the innermost (1+3)=4, then each step was 1 + 3*(previous). I did this 9 times, ending up with 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But according to the recurrence, a_9 is 29524, so 3*a_9 is 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the first 3*(...), each subsequent 1+3(...) is one level deeper. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*: \n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the first 3*, each 1 + 3*(... is a new level. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...)\n2. (1 + 3*(...)\n3. (1 + 3*(...)\n4. (1 + 3*(...)\n5. (1 + 3*(...)\n6. (1 + 3*(...)\n7. (1 + 3*(...)\n8. (1 + 3*(...)\n9. (1 + 3*(...)\n\nWait, so there are 9 levels inside the first 3*. So, that would mean a_9 is the innermost expression, which is 4, and then building up to a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I started with the innermost as 4, then built up 9 times, getting to 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, that suggests that I computed a_10 instead of a_9, because the initial 3* is outside of the 9 levels. So, perhaps the correct number of levels is 9, so a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial computation, I had 9 steps of 1 + 3*..., starting from 4, leading to 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, that would be 10 levels, but the problem only has 9 levels inside the first 3*. So, I think I made a mistake in counting the number of levels. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(expression). The expression is 1 + 3*(another expression). Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...). Let's count how many times 1 + 3*( occurs after the initial 3*.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3*, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...). Each of these is a new level. So, the innermost is the 9th level, which is (1 + 3). So, that would mean that the number of levels is 9, so a_9 is the innermost, which is 4, and then building up to a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I treated the innermost as the first level, then built up 9 levels, leading to a_9=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. That suggests that I considered the initial 3* as part of the levels, which it isn't. The initial 3* is outside the 9 levels. So, the correct number of levels is 9, leading to a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4=13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13=40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40=121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121=364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524=88573\n\n11. 3*88573=265719\n\nSo, that's 10 steps inside, but the problem only has 9 levels. So, I think I miscounted the levels. Let me recount the number of 1 + 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n\nWait, that's 10 steps, but the problem only has 9 levels. So, perhaps I have an extra step. Let me look at the original problem again: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the first one after the initial 3*:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...)\n2. (1 + 3*(...)\n3. (1 + 3*(...)\n4. (1 + 3*(...)\n5. (1 + 3*(...)\n6. (1 + 3*(...)\n7. (1 + 3*(...)\n8. (1 + 3*(...)\n9. (1 + 3*(...)\n\nSo, 9 levels. Therefore, the innermost is the 9th level, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, each level up adds one more step. So, after 9 levels, the value is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I went one step further, getting to 88573, then multiplied by 3, which gave me 265719. So, that's incorrect because I should have stopped at a_9=29524 and multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4=13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13=40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40=121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121=364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524=88573\n\n11. 3*88573=265719\n\nSo, I have 10 levels, but the problem only has 9. Therefore, I think the error is that I included the initial 3* as part of the levels, but it's actually outside. So, the 9 levels are inside the first 3*, so the computation should stop at a_9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 levels inside. So, the first 3* is outside, and the 9 levels are inside. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I computed 10 levels, leading to 88573, then multiplied by 3, which is incorrect because I included the initial 3* as part of the levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with the formula. The general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial mistake was counting the initial 3* as part of the levels, leading me to compute 10 levels instead of 9, resulting in an incorrect final answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check this again. Let me compute the expression step by step, but this time, only 9 levels.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 levels, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial mistake was an off-by-one error in counting the number of levels. The problem has 9 levels inside the first 3*, so after computing 9 levels, we have 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with another approach. Let's consider the expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, with 9 levels, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then each level adds another 3*(previous) +1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different.\n\nBut given that the recurrence relation gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and for n=9, a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested pattern that can be broken down step by step. By defining a sequence where each term is based on the previous one, we derive a formula and compute the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated multiple times. Each level is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The sequence follows a linear recurrence relation. Solving it, we find the general term \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the Innermost Levels**: Calculate each term up to \\( a_9 \\):\n   - \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\), resulting in \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's try that. Let me start by labeling each layer to keep track. Let me define each innermost expression as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. I can break this down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me verify 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after going through each layer step by step and computing each part carefully, I arrive at the final result of 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the innermost is just (1 + 3), which is 4, but then the next level is 3*(1 + 4). Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's take it step by step, starting from the innermost parenthesis. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(result from innermost)). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that's the next level. Then moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*(result from previous level)). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nLevel 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing up to Level 9, which is 29524, do I then multiply that by 3? Let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, if I computed up to Level 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's see, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go through each level again to make sure.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, after Level 9, we have 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n\nCompute 9000*3=27000\n\nCompute 500*3=1500\n\nCompute 20*3=60\n\nCompute 4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each level manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nSo, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, both by iterative computation and by finding a closed-form formula, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula and compute the result step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. It has nine levels of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Parentheses First**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation**:\n   - The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 has a closed-form solution a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n   - For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n   - Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that. Let's start from the very inside. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let's compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, now we have 40. Hmm, so each time we move out a layer, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me write down the pattern I'm seeing here: Starting from the innermost: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13 Level 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40 Level 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121 Level 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364 Level 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 Level 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 Level 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 Level 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Well, 29,524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Maybe I should verify each step again. Let's go back through each level to check for errors.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, earlier I wrote 1 + 3*(40) = 121, but 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is indeed 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Earlier, I wrote Level 6 as 1 + 3*364 = 1093, but 3*364 is actually 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Wait, hold on. 3*9,841 is 29,523, so 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29,524). As I calculated before, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Let me confirm that multiplication again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it directly:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the levels correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I worked out nine levels, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of level 9). So, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each level step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet's define a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is correct. So, this seems to fit.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with the values we have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, the value would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what we got earlier for level 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me retrace my steps once more.\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Then: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Then: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n8. Then: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n9. Finally: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. I think I've got this right. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and applying the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be computed step by step or using a derived formula. The final result after evaluating all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first. Let me number the parentheses from the inside out for clarity. Let's say the innermost is the 9th one: 1 + 3. Then the 8th one would be 1 + 3*(result of 9th). The 7th would be 1 + 3*(result of 8th), and so on, until the outermost one, which is the 1st and gets multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's compute the innermost expression, which is the 9th one: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the 9th layer is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the 8th expression is 1 + 3*(result of 9th). Since the 9th is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the 8th layer is 13. Next, the 7th expression is 1 + 3*(result of 8th). The 8th layer was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the 7th layer is 40. Moving on to the 6th expression: 1 + 3*(result of 7th). The 7th was 40, so 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, the 6th layer is 121. Next, the 5th expression: 1 + 3*(result of 6th). The 6th was 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, the 5th layer is 364. Now, the 4th expression: 1 + 3*(result of 5th). The 5th was 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, the 4th layer is 1093. Moving to the 3rd expression: 1 + 3*(result of 4th). The 4th was 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, the 3rd layer is 3280. Next, the 2nd expression: 1 + 3*(result of 3rd). The 3rd was 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, the 2nd layer is 9841. Finally, the outermost expression, which is the 1st: 3*(result of 2nd). The 2nd layer was 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9841 * 3. Hmm, let's break that down. 9000 * 3 is 27000, 800 * 3 is 2400, 40 * 3 is 120, and 1 * 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that I did each step correctly because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check for errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n9th: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n8th: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n7th: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n6th: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5th: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n4th: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n3rd: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n2nd: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n1st: 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final answer should indeed be 29523. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula, but given the depth of nesting, it's probably more straightforward to compute each layer step by step. It might also be possible to express this recursively, but since I already have the step-by-step computation verified, I think that's solid.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach works. Let's say, for example, if the expression was only two layers deep: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That's correct.\n\nAnother test: three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, no, if it's three layers, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, outermost is 3*40 = 120. So, 120 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I thought of computing directly, I misapplied the layers. So, yeah, 120 is correct. So, my step-by-step approach works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the nine-layer problem.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct: 29523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. Wait, 3*9000 is indeed 27000. Then, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123, so 2400 + 123 = 2523. So, adding 27000 + 2523 gives 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, let me check: the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which we've computed as 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me denote each part as a step. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost expression Step 1: 1 + 3\n- Then, moving out one layer, that becomes Step 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1)\n- Then Step 3 would be 1 + 3*(Step 2)\n- And so on, until I get to Step 9, which is the outermost expression, and then multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, perhaps I should consider that the first step is the innermost 1 + 3, then each subsequent step adds another layer, and after nine steps, I multiply the result by 3. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first parenthesis is at 3(1+3(...), then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(...)\". Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, 1+3(...))\n3. Then another 1+3(...))\n4. Another 1+3(...))\n5. Another 1+3(...))\n6. Another 1+3(...))\n7. Another 1+3(...))\n8. Another 1+3(...))\n9. Finally, 1+3(...))\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost part is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous result). So, there are nine layers of 1+3*(something), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this Step 1: 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(Step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this Step 2: 13.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(Step 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Step 3: 40.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(Step 3). So, 1 + 3*40. That would be 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. Step 4: 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Step 5: 364.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let's do that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Step 6: 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Step 7: 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Step 8: 9841.\n\nFinally, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Step 9: 29524.\n\nWait, so after nine steps, I've reached 29524. But hold on, the original problem is 3*(all that). So, after computing the innermost expression and working outwards, I end up with 29524, and then I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Let me go through each step again quickly to check for errors.\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me double-check Step 9. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute it directly:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524*3: Let me compute it again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Step 9, that's the innermost 1+3, then each step adds a layer, so after 9 steps, I have the innermost 1+3 and 8 more layers around it, making 9 layers in total. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so yes, 3*(Step 9) is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which itself has nine layers. So, my approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it without calculating each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each step as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nThen, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by step-by-step computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That's probably more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I already computed it step by step and verified it with the closed-form solution, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. After computing all nine layers, multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n4. Alternatively, model the problem using a recurrence relation and solve it to find a closed-form expression, which can then be evaluated directly.\n\nBoth methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree, so I'm satisfied with this solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But let me check: The innermost part is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then, moving outwards, the next layer is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), which would be Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer one by one, I can substitute the value into the next layer. That seems manageable. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = (1 + 3*121). Let me compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364). Hmm, 364*3. Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = (1 + 3*3280). Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000; 9000*3 = 27000; 500*3 = 1500; 20*3 = 60; 4*3 = 12. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that multiplication another way just to be sure. Maybe by breaking down 29524 into 29000 + 524.\n\n29000 * 3 = 87000.\n\n524 * 3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 1500 + 72 = 1572.\n\nAdding 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go back and make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLet me recap each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each layer seems correct when I check them again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, which might be more efficient. Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4.\n\nWait, let me see. Actually, the first term inside is (1 + 3), which is 4, so that's a(1) = 4. Then a(2) = 1 + 3*a(1) = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a(3) = 1 + 3*a(2) = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). Let me recall how to solve such recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form is a(n) = c + k*a(n-1), which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a(n) - k*a(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation would be r - k = 0, so r = k. So, the homogeneous solution is A*k^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (c), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nP = c + k*P\n\nSolving for P: P - k*P = c => P*(1 - k) = c => P = c / (1 - k).\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = homogeneous + particular = A*k^n + c/(1 - k).\n\nIn our case, c = 1 and k = 3. So, the particular solution is 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4. So, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all the layers up to n=9, which is Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I had before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(Layer 9) is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147, then (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it more directly without going through each layer. That might have saved some time, but since I was doing it step by step, it worked out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers or the final multiplication.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding all the layers, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This can be expressed as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nBut since each layer is encapsulated within another, it's more of a nested structure rather than a simple geometric series. However, the formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation is more applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, it's similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nIn any case, since I've computed each layer step by step and verified using the formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Layer 1: 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n- Layer 4: 121\n- Layer 5: 364\n- Layer 6: 1093\n- Layer 7: 3280\n- Layer 8: 9841\n- Layer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. I think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should start solving from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that 4, right? Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then moving out one layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's denote each layer with a number to keep track. Let me define each step:\n\nLet me number the innermost parentheses as step 1, then step 2, and so on until step 9, since there are nine layers.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times this entire nested expression. So after computing the innermost parentheses up to step 9, which gives me 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final step would be: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Maybe breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps when computing each layer. Because if I messed up one step, the entire result would be wrong. Let me retrace each step:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(... nine times ...))). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is step 1, and working out, I did nine steps, each time moving outward. So, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each time, the expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find C, let's solve for the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nSo, C = 1 + 3*C\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a geometric progression.\n\nBut since I already have the closed-form and confirmed it with both step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, just in case I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as 3 times a sum that is built recursively. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, the total number of layers is nine, so the expression inside is a_9 as defined earlier, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine 1s. But I think the way I approached it before is solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds another power of 3. So, for example, the innermost is 4, which is 3 + 1. The next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 3^2 + 3 + 1. Wait, 3^2 is 9, plus 3 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. So, it's like each layer is the sum of a geometric series up to that point.\n\nWait a minute, so in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is what I had before.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to write this down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4\n3. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, let me compute each step one by one.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: Now, moving another layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That looks right.\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving on.\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nLet me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, add 1: 1092 +1=1093.\n\nSo, step 6 result is 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9=3279. Then, add 1: 3279 +1=3280.\n\nStep 7 result is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, add 1: 9840 +1=9841.\n\nStep 8 result is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, add 1: 29523 +1=29524.\n\nStep 9 result is 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression has nine layers, so after step 9, we have the innermost part computed, but the entire expression is 3 times that result. Let me make sure I'm not missing a step. So, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost (1 + 3) is step 1, then each subsequent step adds another layer, and after nine steps, we have the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that value. So, the final step would be step 10: 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3: \n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that computation again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly counted the number of steps. The original expression has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), so I computed up to step 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the steps. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, given that each step is similar. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n represents the value at the nth layer, where n is the number of layers from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the sequence is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression by expanding each layer step by step again to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, same result.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and moving outward, each time substituting the result back into the outer expression. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that 4. So, let's compute that. 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40. Let's keep going. The next layer is 1 + 3 times 40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, now we have 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that layer is 29524. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*73 is 219. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 219 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, that layer simplifies to 265720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*265720. Let me compute that. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*720 is 2160. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2160 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797160. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then 1 + 3*88573 = 265720. Finally, 3*265720 = 797160. Yeah, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the calculations seem accurate. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my computations. So, I think the final answer is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...).

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me try to parse it from the inside out. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then each layer wraps around the previous one. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (that's the innermost) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 9 first, then multiply by 3. But to compute Layer 9, I need Layer 8, and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).

    "text": " Maybe if I start solving from the innermost part, I can find a pattern or a formula that can help me compute it without having to calculate each step manually, which would be time-consuming. Let me try to tackle the innermost part first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the next layer out is 3 times that result. Wait, no, let me check. The innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next layer is (1 + 3*(innermost)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is (1 + 3*(next inner layer)). So, starting from the innermost, let's define each layer step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, L1 = (1 + 3) = 4. Then, L2 = (1 + 3*L1) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = (1 + 3*L2) = (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = (1 + 3*L3) = (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = (1 + 3*L4) = (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = (1 + 3*L5) = (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = (1 + 3*L6) = (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = (1 + 3*L7) = (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = (1 + 3*L8) = (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression only has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: Each time, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the first 3, the next is 1+3(...), which is L1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, actually, the original expression has 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, when I calculated up to L9, that should be the innermost part. But wait, the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I calculated L1 through L9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, let me check that again. Wait, no, actually, each layer is (1 + 3*previous layer). So, starting from L1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524. Wait, but that's not correct because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the first 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which is L9. So, the total is 3*L9 = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost (1 +3)=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + a*(a + a*(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if this applies here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let x be the value of the innermost expression, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3x. But in this case, each layer is built upon the previous one, so it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous term. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nSo, each term Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where n ranges from 2 to 9, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for Ln.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is Ln = a^(n-1)*L1 + b*(a^(n-1) - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation.\n\nFor a recurrence relation of the form Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, with L1 = c, the solution is:\n\nLn = a^(n-1)*c + b*(a^(n-1) - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nLet me confirm this formula. For n=1, Ln = c, which is correct. For n=2, Ln = a*c + b, which matches the recurrence. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, in our case, a=3, b=1, c=L1=4.\n\nTherefore, Ln = 3^(n-1)*4 + 1*(3^(n-1) - 1)/(3 - 1).\n\nSimplify that:\n\nLn = 4*3^(n-1) + (3^(n-1) - 1)/2.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nLet me factor out 3^(n-1):\n\nLn = (4 + 1/2)*3^(n-1) - 1/2.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, Ln = 4*3^(n-1) + (3^(n-1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me write both terms over a common denominator:\n\n= (8*3^(n-1) + 3^(n-1) - 1)/2\n\n= (9*3^(n-1) -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, Ln = (9*3^(n-1) -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1:\n\nL1 = (9*3^(0) -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = (8)/2 =4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL2 = (9*3^(1) -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (9*3^2 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n(9*81 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches my earlier calculation of L4=121? Wait, no, wait, earlier I had L4=121, but according to this formula, L4=(9*3^3 -1)/2=(9*27 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nSo, generalizing, Ln = (9*3^(n-1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (9*3^8 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, L9 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The formula gives Ln = (9*3^(n-1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (9*6561 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula that can express the entire expression without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me think: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers inside. So, it's 3*L9, where L9 is as computed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, expanding the entire expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 +3) =4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13.\n\nThen, 1 +3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer is of the form (1 + 3*previous), and the entire expression is a sum that can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as follows:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nBut wait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, it's not an infinite series, but a finite one with nine layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it recursively.\n\nWait, but since I've already computed it step by step and confirmed with the formula, maybe I can stick with that.\n\nWait, let me try to compute it step by step again, just to be sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the nth term of the recurrence to find L9 directly.\n\nAs I derived earlier, Ln = (9*3^(n-1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\nL9 = (9*3^8 -1)/2 = (9*6561 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut since each layer is built upon the previous one, it's more of a linear recurrence than a geometric series.\n\nBut regardless, the calculations seem consistent.\n\nLet me check the multiplication again: 3*29524.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) *3 = 30000*3 -476*3=90000 -1428=88572.\n\nYes, that also gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572, which I should present in a box as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L2 = 1 + 3 \\times L1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L3 = 1 + 3 \\times L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L4 = 1 + 3 \\times L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L5 = 1 + 3 \\times L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L6 = 1 + 3 \\times L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L7 = 1 + 3 \\times L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L8 = 1 + 3 \\times L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L9 = 1 + 3 \\times L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by \\(L9\\):\n\\[\n3 \\times L9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 Since there are no more parentheses inside L1, that's just 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so L1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, which would be L2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 is 13. Next, L3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L3 is 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L4 is 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L5 is 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L6 is 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L7 is 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L8 is 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. L9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original problem is 3 times this entire expression. So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is L9, which we just calculated as 29524. Therefore, the entire problem is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, let me verify that again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. So, the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me check if I did all the steps correctly. Starting from the innermost: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each time, the term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think. If I have a recursive formula where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we calculated earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm once again because I don't want to make a mistake. So, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 29524. So, 29524*3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but multiplied by 3 at the end. Wait, let me see. Let me try to write the entire expression step by step, expanding each layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out: (1 + 3*4) = 13. Then, (1 + 3*13) = 40. Then, (1 + 3*40) = 121. Then, (1 + 3*121) = 364. Then, (1 + 3*364) = 1093. Then, (1 + 3*1093) = 3280. Then, (1 + 3*3280) = 9841. Then, (1 + 3*9841) = 29524. So, that's 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, perhaps the total inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I denote S as the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses, then S = 1 + 3*S_inner, where S_inner is the next layer. But in this case, since there are multiple layers, it's more complicated. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives us a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, S = 29524, and then the entire problem is 3*S = 88,572. So, that's another way to see it. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After calculating all layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
