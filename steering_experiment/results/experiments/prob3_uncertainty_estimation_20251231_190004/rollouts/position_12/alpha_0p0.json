    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me number the layers from the inside out for clarity. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3(L1). L3 = 1 + 3(L2). And so on, until L9, which is multiplied by the outermost 3. Hmm, that sounds manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to L2: L2 = 1 + 3(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 is 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. L3 is 40. Moving on to L4: L4 = 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. L4 is 121. Now, L5 = 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, L5 is 364. Next, L6 = 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, L6 is 1093. Moving to L7: L7 = 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, L7 is 3280. Next, L8 = 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L8 is 9841. Now, L9 = 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 29524. So, let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it more carefully. 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. I think I did each step carefully, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner expression by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, resulting in the final value of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, since there are nine sets of parentheses, maybe I should think of them as Layers 1 through 9, with Layer 1 being the innermost. Wait, but when I look at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So, let me start there. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13: that's 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. I think I did that correctly. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it step by step helped. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and then moving outward, each time substituting the computed value back into the outer expression. Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let's compute that first. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(innermost result)). So, substituting 4 in place of the innermost part, it becomes (1 + 3*4). Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have (1 + 3*13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, now we have 40. Next layer: (1 + 3*40). 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 121. Interesting, that's a square number. Let me keep track of these results: 4, 13, 40, 121... I wonder if there's a pattern here. Next layer: (1 + 3*121). 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Hmm, 364. Not sure if that's significant. Let's proceed. Next layer: (1 + 3*364). 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's a big number. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Okay, moving on. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's a nice round number. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wow, that's a big number. Now, moving to the outermost layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this value. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding these together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, the total value is 265,719. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573 times 3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, carryover 2, 3*5=15 + 2=17, carryover 1, 3*8=24 +1=25, carryover 2, 3*8=24 +2=26, carryover 2, 3*0=0 +2=2. Wait, no, 88573 is five digits: 8,8,5,7,3. Let me write it out: 88,573 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n3*3 = 9  \n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2  \n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1  \n3*8 = 24 +1 =25, write down 5, carryover 2  \n3*8 =24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2  \nBut since there are no more digits, we write down 2. So, the result is 265,719. Yes, that matches what I had before. So, 3*88,573 = 265,719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. I started from the innermost parentheses, which was (1+3)=4. Then each subsequent layer was (1 + 3*previous result). So, I computed each layer step by step, moving outward, each time substituting the computed value into the next outer expression. I did this nine times, because I counted nine sets of parentheses. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. After computing the innermost nine layers, I ended up with 88,573, and then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 265,719. I think that makes sense. It's a bit tedious, but since each step depends on the previous one, there's no shortcut except computing each layer carefully. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 265,719 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nWait, that doesn't match my earlier conclusion. Let me check again. Oh, I think I made a mistake in the final step. Let's correct that.\n\nAfter computing the innermost nine layers, the result is 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*29524). Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost nine layers, we have the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(29524)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so after nine layers, the innermost is 29524, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So, the number of layers is 9, each adding a 3*(...). So, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*29524). Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is the result after 8 layers. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me clarify. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, each layer out adds another 3*(previous). So, after the first layer, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13. Second layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Third: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Fourth: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Fifth: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Sixth: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Seventh: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Eighth: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Ninth: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*(88573) = 265,719.\n\nSo, the correct final answer is 265,719.\n\n\\boxed{265719}"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote each innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, with each Layer n being 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Wait, but in the given problem, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me check the next few layers to see if I can spot a pattern or a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Well, 3*9000 is 27,000, and 3*841 is 2,523. So 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then adding 1 gives 29,524. So Layer 9 is 29,524. But wait, the original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So the entire expression is 3*(29,524). Let me compute that: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So the total should be 88,572.

Then 3*29,524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding these: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) nine times seems like it could be a geometric series or something, maybe there's a formula to compute it without doing each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59,049 -1)/2 = 3*(59,048)/2 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed sequentially.

    "text": " Since it's nested, the innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3, and then each layer builds on that. Let me start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. So, starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is straightforward. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let me list out the results as I go along: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Let me continue this process step by step for each layer until I reach the outermost one. So, after 40, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 29000*3 is 87000, 524*3 is 1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Now, this entire result is inside another set of parentheses, and the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by that result. So, the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let's break it down: 80000*3 = 240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, and 3*3=9. Wait, no, that's not correct because 88573 is actually 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 3*(80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3) = 3*80000 + 3*8000 + 3*500 + 3*70 + 3*3. Calculating each term: 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, and 3*3 = 9. Now, adding all these together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, and 265710 + 9 = 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 265719. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me go back through each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n11. Then, 3*88573 = 265719 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" starts a new layer, and I count nine sets of parentheses, each with a 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers to compute, each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. But when I went through the steps, I ended up with 11 steps. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3. Then, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is the number of times \"1+\" appears before a closing parenthesis. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*(result above)) = 13\n3. (1+3*13) = 40\n4. (1+3*40) = 121\n5. (1+3*121) = 364\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1+3*29524) = 88573\n11. Finally, 3*(88573) = 265719\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers of 1+3(...) and then the outermost 3*(...). So, 10 layers inside, then multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me check the original expression again. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+\" is followed by 3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+\" sections:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, the next is (1+3(...))\n3. Continuing outward, each time adding another (1+3(...))\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine \"1+\" terms, each nested inside the previous one. So, that would mean nine layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps I should have only nine layers inside, each time computing 1+3*(previous result). Let me recount with that in mind.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nWait, so that's nine layers inside, each time computing 1+3*(previous result). So, the ninth layer is 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(29524). Wait, but earlier I thought I had 10 layers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by 3(...), and each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+\", each subsequent \"1+\" is nested inside the previous one. Let me count the number of \"1+\" sections:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1+\" is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, the expression can be seen as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...), and there are nine such \"1+\" terms, each nested within the previous. Therefore, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, that's nine layers inside, each time 1 + 3*(previous result). Therefore, the process is as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, the result is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nFirst, break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = ?\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final result was 265719, but that was when I had an extra layer. Wait, no, perhaps I confused the steps earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, in my initial counting, I thought there were nine layers inside, leading to 29524, and then the outermost 3*29524 is 88572, which is the final result. But earlier, I had a different count, leading to 265719, which must be incorrect.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a table to keep track of each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer with its corresponding result:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 3*(88573) = 265719, which seems to be a miscalculation because I added an extra layer. So, I think the correct number of layers is nine, leading to 29524 inside, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I'm not miscounting the layers.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\" sections:\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by 3(...), and each time, the depth increases. Let me count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first \"1+\", there's a 3 followed by another \"1+\", etc. So, the number of \"1+\" sections is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first \"3(\":\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3 is for the first \"1+3\".\n2. Then, each subsequent \"(\" is for each nested \"1+3\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial \"3(\":\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial \"3(\":\n\n1. First \"(\" after 3: starts the first \"1+3\"\n2. Then, each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, the number of \"(\" is equal to the number of times \"1+\" appears as a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1+\" is followed by a new \"(\" except for the innermost one. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+\" sections minus one. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to recognize that each \"1+\" corresponds to a term in a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence and find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nFirst, plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can write the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nTo find the homogeneous solution, set a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back at the original expression: Each \"1+\" is a new layer. Starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another a_n, so the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3 is layer 9: a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265719, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I get 88572 as the result.\n\nLet me verify this with the step-by-step computation I did earlier.\n\nEarlier, I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That matches with the formula.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. That must have been a mistake because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, no, according to the recurrence, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, which would be a_10, but in the original expression, there are only nine layers inside, so the outermost operation is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again by counting the number of layers.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, each subsequent \"1+\" is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1+\" appear?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there's a \"1+\", then inside that, another \"1+\", and so on, until the innermost \"1+3\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+\", each subsequent \"1+\" is inside the previous one. Let me count:\n\n- The first \"1+\" is at position 3: 3(1+...\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+\", etc.\n\nSo, the number of \"1+\"s is equal to the number of times the pattern \"1+\" appears, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial \"3(\".\n\nEach \"(\" corresponds to a new layer. So, the number of \"(\" after the initial \"3(\" is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial \"3(\":\n\n1. First \"(\" after 3: starts the first \"1+3\"\n2. Then, each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\nAfter \"3(\", the first \"(\" is at position 4: 3(1+3(...\n\nThen, inside that, another \"(\", etc., until the innermost \"1+3\".\n\nSo, how many \"(\" are there after the initial \"3(\"?\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nNow, let's count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. After 3(, the first \"(\" is at position 4: 3(1+3(\n2. Then, another \"(\" inside that: 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. And so on, until the innermost \"(\".\n\nEach \"(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3( -> 1 \"(\"\n2. 3(1+3(1+3( -> 2 \"(\"s\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3( -> 3 \"(\"s\n4. Continuing this way, until we reach the innermost \"1+3\".\n\nWait, but the innermost part is \"1+3)\", so the number of \"(\"s is equal to the number of layers minus one? Or perhaps it's equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that each \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so the number of \"1+\"s is equal to the number of layers. So, in the expression, each \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", except for the innermost one.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me parse the expression as a tree.\n\nThe outermost expression is 3*(A), where A is (1 + 3*(B)), and B is (1 + 3*(C)), and so on, until the innermost C is (1+3).\n\nSo, each \"1+\" is a node in the tree, and each has a child which is 3*(...). So, the depth of the tree is the number of layers.\n\nIn the original expression, the number of times \"1+\" appears is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(\", except the last one, which is followed by a \"3))\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\nEach \"1+\" is at the start of a new layer. So, starting from the outermost, the first \"1+\" is at position 3: 3(1+3(...)).\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1+\" at position 7: 3(1+3(1+3(...))).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try writing the expression with indices.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, with Layer 1 being the innermost, and Layer 9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, with Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 13, Layer 3 = 40, Layer 4 = 121, Layer 5 = 364, Layer 6 = 1093, Layer 7 = 3280, Layer 8 = 9841, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265719, which was incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nLet me confirm this with the formula I derived earlier: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no. Actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). Hmm, let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by something. That something is 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, maybe I should label each nested part as follows: Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 10)\nWait, but hold on, the innermost layer is Layer 9: 1 + 3, right? Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and there are nine sets of parentheses. So, perhaps it's better to think of the innermost as Layer 1, then the next as Layer 2, up to Layer 9. Wait, no, that might confuse me. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Starting from the inside, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me write each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(innermost) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute: 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute: 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute: 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute: 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by that result.\n\nSo, 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdd them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nSuppose I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is a + b*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a + b*(previous result). So, in this case, a is 1, b is 3, and n is 9.\n\nIs there a formula for such a nested expression? Let me see.\n\nLet me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where k=1 is the innermost.\n\nThen, L_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, in this case, n=9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k.\n\nA particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming a constant particular solution L_k^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and find the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both step-by-step expansion and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the result is confirmed to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe if I start solving from the innermost part, each step will become clearer. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, maybe I should consider that as layer 10? Hmm, not sure. Let me just proceed step by step. Starting with the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Let me write that down as the result for the innermost layer. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that's the result for the next layer out. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so the result for this layer is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, 121 is the result here. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, 364 is the next result. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. That's a big number, but okay. Next layer out: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1093*3. Let's do this step by step: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, 3280 is the result here. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3*3280. Well, 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so adding those gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, 9841 is the result for this layer. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524. Next layer out: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that's 88573. Now, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, that's 265720. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let's compute 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. So, that's 797161. Now, remember that the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the outermost operation is 3*(797161). Let me compute that: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 3*797161 = 2391483. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 2,391,483. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 797,161 times 3: Let me do it digit by digit. 1*3=3, 6*3=18, carryover 1. 1*3=3 +1=4, 7*3=21, carryover 2. 1*3=3 +2=5, 9*3=27, carryover 2. 7*3=21 +2=23, carryover 2. 9*3=27 +2=29, carryover 2. 7*3=21 +2=23, carryover 2. 7*3=21 +2=23, carryover 2. 3*3=9 +2=11. So, writing it out: 2391483. Yep, that seems correct. So, I think my calculation is right. I started from the innermost parentheses, worked my way out, and each step built upon the previous one. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I don't think I made any mistakes, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check one of the intermediate steps. Let's take layer 5, which was 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Let me verify that: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Yep, that's correct. So, that step was right. Another check: layer 7 was 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wait, no, that was layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Let me check that: 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. So, that step was also right. I think my process was solid, so I feel confident that the final answer is 2,391,483.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer gives me 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let's do that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, so far, the numbers are growing quickly. Let me keep track of each step to avoid confusion. So, each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that in the next layer. Let me make a list of each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each time I compute a layer, I'm moving out one step. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I have nine layers, I should compute nine times. Let me recount:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nOkay, so after nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that result, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. Let me confirm: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, after computing the nested part as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Maybe another way: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Did I count the layers correctly? Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time we have a 1+3(, which is a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3( sequences:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 1+3(, each subsequent one is another layer. Let me count how many times 1+3( occurs:\n\n- The first one after the initial 3( is the first layer: 1+3(...\n- Then each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the number of layers is 9 because each 1+3( adds a layer, and there are 9 of them. Let me count the number of 1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3( is the outermost. Then inside that, there's 1+3(, which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1+3(, which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost is 1+3). Let me count the number of 1+3(:\n\n- Starting from the outermost, the first 1+3( is the first layer.\n- Then inside that, another 1+3( is the second layer.\n- Continuing this way, how many times does 1+3( occur?\n\nLet me write down the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3( ... )))\n\nInside Layer 1, Layer 2: 1 + 3( ... )\n\nInside Layer 2, Layer 3: 1 + 3( ... )\n\nAnd so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I initially computed, I went from Layer 1 to Layer 9, getting 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I need to make sure that I correctly accounted for all layers. Let me recount:\n\nIf I have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 =13, and so on up to 9 layers, then the final result before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut to be absolutely certain, let me write each step clearly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, a_2 is the next, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 =1 +3=4\n\na_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +363=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +1092=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3279=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +9840=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which could help in computing it without having to do each step manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P =1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P: P -3P=1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2\n\nThus, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the original expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next layer around it is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3( ) But wait, the innermost expression is just 1 + 3, right? Because after that, each layer adds another 3(...). Wait, no, looking again, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...).

Let me count the opening parentheses: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, I see that after the initial 3, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, maybe there are nine layers? Wait, no, because each (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. Let me think again. Let me start by evaluating the innermost expression and work my way outwards. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet's start by evaluating the innermost part first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving outward to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 2 result: 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 result: 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute that: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 result: 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute that: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 result: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute that: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 result: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute that: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 result: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute that: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 result: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute that: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 result: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so we have:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nCompute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit large, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each time it's 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers. So, n=9, as I used earlier.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the formula is correct for n=1, which we did, and n=2, etc., so it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the expression step by step, as I did earlier, and it gives the same result, so I think 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we evaluate it step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous result}\\), leading to a total of 9 layers. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find the result of the innermost expression and work our way out.

So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. So, each time I go out a layer, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me list the results as I go out each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that. Each step, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, the innermost is 4, and each subsequent layer out gives me the next number. So, after nine layers, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Maybe breaking it down differently:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write 29524:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that once more because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524.\n\nAgain, starting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait a second, let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the inner layers. Each layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer:\n\n1. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n2. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n3. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n4. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n5. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n6. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n7. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n8. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, right? Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost, that's the first layer, then each time I went out another layer, that's nine layers in total. So, the final result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the next term. If I let a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3*B = 1 => -2*B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, since there are nine layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully working through the problem step by step, both by expanding each layer and by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrive at the same answer both times. That gives me confidence that the result is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident enough now that the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. The innermost expression is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. The next layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nAfter evaluating the innermost nine layers, we get the result \\(29524\\). The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers, which would throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.

So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which is 3*(Layer9). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL_2 =1 +3*L1=1+12=13\n\nL_3=1 +3*L2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A =3*A +1 \u2192 A -3A =1 \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21924 =3C -1/2 \u21923C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192C=(9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's good to recognize the pattern and derive a formula instead of computing each layer manually, although in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods are manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so Layer9 is (3^10 -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nEither way, the result is consistent.\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the final multiplication, let me double-check 3*29524.\n\n29524*3:\n\nLet's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carryover2.\n\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u2192 write7, carryover1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the innermost layers compute to 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524 for the ninth layer. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me label each layer to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, it's Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking at it, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? So, let me start there. Layer 1: (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and moving outward, each layer's value is calculated and substituted into the next. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me label each layer from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Since there's nothing inside the parentheses after that, Layer 1 is just 1 + 3, which is 4. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3; so 300+60+3=363. Then, 363 + 1 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, and 3*1=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, and 3*4=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. I think that's the right answer.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward is Layer 2, up to Layer 9, with the entire expression being Layer 10? Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count: 1. Innermost: (1 + 3) 2. Next: (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Layer 1 3. Then: (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Layer 2, and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...), and this happens 8 times before the outermost 3(...). Wait, maybe I should count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is followed by a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): There's 9 instances of 1 + 3(...). So, that would mean Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and Layer 9 is the outermost 1 + 3(...). So, I need to compute each layer from 1 to 9, each time substituting the inner layers first. Let me try that approach. So, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 3*29524.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly because 88572 seems quite a large number. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to be correctly calculated. Then, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series, perhaps. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^n + B\n\nSet equal to right-hand side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the initial layers.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for a_9, which is Layer 9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistake here. Let me compute 3^{10} again just to be certain.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything in the original problem. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from (1 + 3), that's Layer 1, then each subsequent 1 + 3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer, and there are 9 such layers, as I had before. So, a_9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, all correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression.

Let me see: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as nine layers because each time the expression is wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, let's define a\u2081 as 1 + 3, then a\u2082 as 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 as 1 + 3a\u2082, up to a\u2089, and then the entire expression is 3a\u2089.\n\nWait, let me verify that. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is a\u2081. Then the next layer is 1 + 3(a\u2081), which is a\u2082. Then the next is 1 + 3(a\u2082) = a\u2083, and so on until a\u2089. Then the entire expression is 3 times a\u2089. So, if I compute a\u2081 through a\u2089, then multiply by 3, I should get the result. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 29,524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 * 9,000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check each a_i step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the sequence.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first layer is 1 + 3.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 first layer\n2. Inside that: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 second layer\n3. Inside that: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 third layer\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3( layer1 )\n\nWhere layer1 is 1 + 3( layer2 )\n\nlayer2 is 1 + 3( layer3 )\n\nlayer3 is 1 + 3( layer4 )\n\nlayer4 is 1 + 3( layer5 )\n\nlayer5 is 1 + 3( layer6 )\n\nlayer6 is 1 + 3( layer7 )\n\nlayer7 is 1 + 3( layer8 )\n\nlayer8 is 1 + 3( layer9 )\n\nlayer9 is 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, layer9 is 1 + 3(1 + 3). Then layer8 is 1 + 3(layer9), and so on up to layer1, which is 1 + 3(layer2). So, how many layers are there? From layer9 up to layer1, that's 9 layers. So, a\u2081 would be layer9, a\u2082 would be layer8, up to a\u2089 being layer1. Wait, but in my earlier approach, I defined a\u2081 as the innermost, which is layer9, then a\u2082 as layer8, and so on up to a\u2089 being layer1. So, perhaps I have 9 terms from a\u2081 to a\u2089, each corresponding to a layer from innermost to outermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed a\u2081 to a\u2089, I ended up with a\u2089 being 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach time I see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3 is layer1.\n2. Then inside that, another \"1 + 3(\" is layer2.\n3. And so on, until the innermost \"1 + 3(\" which is layer9.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, meaning that a\u2081 to a\u2089 are each a layer, starting from the innermost. So, my calculation earlier was correct, and the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each a_i again step by step.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. Then, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the approach works. Let's say, compute a similar expression with fewer layers and see if the result matches.\n\nFor example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). According to the same method, a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13, then the expression is 3*a\u2082 = 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That matches.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Using the method, a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 3*a\u2083 = 120.\n\nComputing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct, and the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of \"1 + 3(...)\" multiplied by 3. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the result to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I can compute each layer step by step, starting with Layer 1 and moving outward. Let's get started. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, and 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. But just to be thorough, let me check if each layer's result is correct by computing a couple more layers manually. Let's see, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Correct. So, all layers compute correctly, and the final result is 88572.

And so on, up to layer 9. Wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps there are 9 layers in total. Let me confirm: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each time we add another 3*(...), so counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 1, I see there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, that means we have nine layers. Therefore, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3 at the end. Wait, no, actually, looking at the original expression, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, the structure is 3*(expression). The expression inside is 1 + 3*(another expression), which itself is 1 + 3*(another expression), and so on. So, perhaps the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).

So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to miscalculate when doing multiple layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, a_n seems to follow a pattern where each term is (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check:\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C =1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a big jump. Let's see Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, these numbers are growing quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, remember, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with such large numbers.

So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, we have 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times that outermost layer, right? Let me check the original problem again: It starts with 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, actually, Layer 9 is the innermost, and the outermost is Layer 10, which is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, hold on. Let me recount. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer, and the very first term is 3 multiplied by that. So, actually, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have n layers, starting from the innermost, I have to compute each layer step by step. Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then moving outward, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, we have 9 layers. Therefore, after computing Layer 9, the outermost layer would be Layer 9, and then we multiply by the initial 3. Wait, no, because the initial expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only 9 layers, manually computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let me think about it. Let's define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*f(9). So, f(1) = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see, the recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplify: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition f(1)=4: f(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3)= (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me start by numbering the layers for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, the next layer is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count them: Starting from the very inside, I see 1+3, then each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer. So, from the inside out, it's 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3 parts. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each time we go outward, we have another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost, that's one layer. Then each time we go out, that's another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out step by step. Let me try that. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, let's compute that. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply it by 3. So, let me make sure I'm not missing that step. Let me recount:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after a 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times this happens. Starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count how many 1+3 are there. From the inside out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me see. The expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), so I think there are nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I stopped at Layer 9 as 29524, but the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can go from the innermost to the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Let's see, each \"1+3(\" adds one. So, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)), so that's one. Then each subsequent ( adds another. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, the number of (1+3(...) is 9, as I can see from the expression. So, that means there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can write the expression with indices to make it clearer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds on the previous one, and the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by computing each layer step by step, then found a pattern and used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed the result. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated multiple times.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost expression:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Work Outwards**: Each subsequent layer uses the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Now, moving one step out, the next expression is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So now, the next layer out would be (1 + 3(13)). Let me compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Let me try to write down each step so I don't get lost.

Hmm, let me do that multiplication step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, I can break it down:\n29524 * 3\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding those together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each step again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 3*4 = 12; 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 3*13 = 39; 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 3*40 = 120; 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 3*121 = 363; 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 3*9841 = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f. All the steps check out. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have made this easier. \n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that could be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can express it that way. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. So, the general recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. \n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach also gives us the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is recognizing that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant each time. But in this case, since each term depends on the previous term multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, it's a linear recurrence, which we've already solved.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as repeatedly applying the function f(x) = 3x + 1, starting from x=1 and doing it nine times, then the result would be a_9, and then multiplying by 3 again. So, f^9(1) is a_9, and then 3*a_9 is the final result. But regardless of the approach, whether computing step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern, the answer remains the same.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the multiplication again: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- There are no more digits, so we're done.\n\nPutting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, hold on, when I did the multiplication earlier, I broke it down as 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3, which gave me 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. That matches with the digit-by-digit multiplication. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've covered all my bases here. I've computed the expression step by step, derived a general formula using recurrence relations, and even double-checked the multiplication. I can't think of any mistakes I might have made, so I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Since there are nine layers, I might need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one. Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's denote each innermost expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nBut wait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so maybe I need to adjust that. Let me count the number of layers properly. Starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nSo, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the nine-layer expression. So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made an arithmetic error.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors earlier.\n\nCompute a_1 to a_9 using a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2:\n\na_1: (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll correct. So, the final step is to multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the final result by 3 yields the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Define Layers:** Let each layer be defined as:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Continue this process up to Layer 9.\n\n3. **Use Recurrence Relation:** Recognize that each layer follows the relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence gives a formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Each Layer Using Formula:**\n   - Layer 1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = 4\n   - Layer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = 13\n   - Layer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = 40\n   - Layer 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = 121\n   - Layer 5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = 364\n   - Layer 6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524\n\n5. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, L1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, which is L2. L2 = 1 + 3(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3(L2). Substituting L2's value, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Therefore, L3 = 40. Moving on to L4: L4 = 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So, L4 = 121. Now, L5 = 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, L5 = 364. Next, L6 = 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, L6 = 1093. Moving on to L7: L7 = 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, L7 = 3280. Next, L8 = 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, L8 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding these: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, L9 = 29524. Now, going back to the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times L9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Therefore, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Wait a minute, that seems like a big number, but considering each step was multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might be correct. Let me just verify the last multiplication to make sure I didn't make an error. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 8*3 is 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my step-by-step process, so I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start computing each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Wait, the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3  \n2. 1+3*(1+3)  \n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))  \n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))  \n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))  \n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))  \n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))  \n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))  \n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))  \nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9)\n\nSo, that's nine layers, starting from layer 1 as 1+3, up to layer 9. Then, the whole expression is 3*layer9.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went up to layer9 as 29524, but let me check that step by step again because I might have made an error.\n\nLet me recast the layers with their correct values:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nSo, layer9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nNow, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000  \n9000 * 3 = 27,000  \n500 * 3 = 1,500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12  \nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572.\n\nBut let me check that with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8  \nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, which would throw off all subsequent layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, layer9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Because if there are more layers, this method would take too long, but for nine layers, it's manageable.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C  \nC - 3C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2  \n4 = 3A - 1/2  \n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, after verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and note that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n3. Verify the computations using a derived formula to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis method helped me avoid errors that might occur from repeatedly computing each layer manually, especially with so many layers.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is effectively a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the layers grow exponentially. The formula we derived, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, reflects this exponential growth.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer's value by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer's value is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar expression)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the value of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start from the very inside. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let me do that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, now we have 364. Moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving outward again, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that layer is 9841. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that layer is 29524. Finally, moving to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that layer is 88573. Now, going back to the original problem, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the outermost operation is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 1+3*40=121. Then, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Then, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. Then, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 1+3*29524=88573. Finally, 3*88573=265,719. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I don't see any arithmetic errors. So, I think the final answer is 265,719. I guess another way to look at this is to recognize the pattern as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, working step by step seems manageable. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward:\n\n1.

    "text": " Since the innermost part is 1 + 3, maybe I can compute that first and then work my way out. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))) Hmm, wait, let me check that. The innermost part is the last 1 + 3, right? So, the very last set of parentheses is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). So, let's compute each layer one by one. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through each layer again step by step to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit from right to left. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 + 1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 + 1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 + 2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)).\n\nSo, the original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1 +3(...)) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3*(...))\n3. Next one: (1 +3*(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1 +3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3(1 +3))\n3. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))\n...\nContinuing until there are nine layers, because each time you go one layer out, you add another 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is nine, as the expression has nine sets of (1 +3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, if I have layer 1 as 4, layer 2 as 13, layer3 as 40, layer4 as 121, layer5 as 364, layer6 as 1093, layer7 as 3280, layer8 as 9841, layer9 as 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer again to be sure.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can use another method to compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) \u00d73\n\n= 20000\u00d73 +9000\u00d73 +500\u00d73 +20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\n=60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 +3)=4, then each layer is 1 +3*(previous). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might help verify the result.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWait, but actually, in my earlier calculation, a1=4, a2=13, etc. So, the recursive formula is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B =1 +3*B \u21d2 B =1 +3B \u21d2 -2B=1 \u21d2 B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d24 =3C -1/2 \u21d23C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a9=29524, as I found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a9 using the formula again:\n\na9=(3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think this is solid. I've checked each layer step by step, and also derived a formula for the nth term, which gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me confirm this multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone. I don't recall a specific formula for this, but if I think about it, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can model it with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the problem is asking for 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0 - d/(c - 1)) + d/(c - 1). Wait, let me recall the exact method. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + s*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so r = 3 and s = 1. Wait, actually, let me write it properly. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s. Here, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, yes, r = 3, s = 1. The solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + s*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see. If I set n = 1, then a_1 = 4. So, using the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But I don't have a_0. Let me see. If I define a_0, then a_1 = 3*a_0 + 1. Since a_1 = 4, 4 = 3*a_0 + 1 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. Then, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Plugging a_0 = 1, we get a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches a_2. For n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, matches a_3. For n=4: (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct, matches a_4. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula is a bit quicker, but since I wasn't sure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the recurrence relation method, we confirm that the value of the innermost expression (Layer 9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " To tackle this, I'll start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost. So, L9: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, L8: 1 + 3*(L9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L8 is 13. Next, L7: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, L7 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check that. So, L6: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. L6 is 121. L5: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. L5 is 364. L4: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. So, L4 is 1093. L3: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. So, L3 is 3280. L2: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. So, L2 is 9841. Finally, L1: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives us 29524. Therefore, L1 is 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3*(L1). So, the entire expression is 3 times L1, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: L9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following the pattern of a geometric series or something similar, but since each step is straightforward, working from the inside out seems to be the most reliable method here. Another way to approach this might be to express it recursively, but I think for clarity, especially since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Just to ensure, let me compute each layer again briefly: L9: 4, L8: 13, L7: 40, L6: 121, L5: 364, L4: 1093, L3: 3280, L2: 9841, L1: 29524. Yes, that's consistent. Then 3*29524 is 88,572. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's start from the very inside. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Let me note that down. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming. Let me see if I can find a general approach here. Each time, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's try that. Let me define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, as I computed earlier. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Continuing this way, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on. So, each term a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Now, I need to compute up to a\u2089 because there are nine layers in the original expression. So, let's compute each term step by step: a\u2081 = 4 a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from a\u2081: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. a\u2082: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. a\u2083: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. a\u2084: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. a\u2085: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. a\u2086: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. a\u2087: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. a\u2088: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. a\u2089: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Okay, so each term seems to be correct. Now, the original expression is 3*(a\u2089). So, once I have a\u2089, I just need to multiply it by 3 to get the final result. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. I started by identifying the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, defined a recursive sequence, calculated each term up to the ninth term, and then multiplied the ninth term by 3. Each step seems to check out, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can compute each layer step by step. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my plan is to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, starting from the inside, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let's get started.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 1 + 39 = 40. Therefore, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nProceeding to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nNow, Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 1 + 363 = 364. Therefore, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nMoving on to Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nNext, Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 1 + 3279 = 3280. Therefore, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nProceeding to Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 1 + 29523 = 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we take Layer 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. I can break this down for easier calculation. 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60.\n\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me try another approach.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same result as before. Hmm, but wait, 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me verify with another method. Maybe using a calculator approach mentally.\n\nAlternatively, 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a minute. When I calculated Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me make sure that Layer 9 was computed correctly because that seems like a very large number, and perhaps I made an error in computing Layer 8 or earlier layers.\n\nLet me double-check the computations for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions, which might save time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n, which could then help in computing the final value without calculating each layer individually.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting L_n^{(p)} into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers to ensure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3(, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", each nested inside the previous one. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my initial breakdown into 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which can be expressed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which again gives the same result.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n3. After computing all layers, multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\n4. To ensure accuracy, I derived a general formula for each layer using recurrence relations, which confirmed that my step-by-step computations were correct.\n\n5. Alternatively, using the formula, I computed the final result directly, arriving at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer. The recurrence relation for each layer is \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\). Using the computed value of \\( L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, which is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\):\n   - \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n   - Multiplying by 3 gives \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841.

Let's denote each layer as follows for clarity:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)  \n...  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)  \n\nBut wait, actually, looking at the original problem, it's a bit different. The innermost part is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me correct that. Let me define each layer starting from the innermost one. Let's call the innermost expression Layer 1, then each layer wraps around it. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n...  \nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \n\nWait, but actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, then inside is 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps it's better to think of each nested expression as a term being multiplied by 3. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nWait, but hold on, the original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841. Let me check that calculation again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, which seems correct. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, is that the final answer? Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, but when I started, I thought of Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. But let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time there's a (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3 around it. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of nested 3(...) terms. Let me try to parse the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3  \nThen, each time we have another 1 + 3*(previous). So, each time we go outward, we add another layer. Let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, 1 + 3 is the base. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3*, there's a (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) expressions. Let's see:\n\n- The first one after 3* is (1 + 3*(...)), which is the innermost, so that's Layer 1: 1 + 3  \n- Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), which is Layer 2  \n- Then, Layer 3 is (1 + 3*(Layer 2))  \n- And so on, until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had Layer 1 as 1 + 3, Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9. But when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9), since there are 9 layers of nesting.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4  \nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nSo, f(9) = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3(...)), so:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1: f(1) = 4  \n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)), so Layer 2: f(2) = 13  \n- Continuing up to Layer 9: f(9) = 29524  \n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the final value is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with f(1):\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nYes, that seems consistent. Now, multiplying f(9) by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute this carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo,\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000  \n9000 * 3 = 27000  \n500 * 3 = 1500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12  \n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572  \n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or find a formula for f(n). Since each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for f(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A  \nA - 3*A = 1  \n-2*A = 1  \nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nf(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nf(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nf(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3  \n3^2=9  \n3^3=27  \n3^4=81  \n3^5=243  \n3^6=729  \n3^7=2187  \n3^8=6561  \n3^9=19683  \n3^{10}=59049  \n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me number the layers for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, that's not quite right because each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Wait, let me check again. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because in the very center, there's 1 + 3. Then, each layer wraps around that. So maybe I should start by computing the innermost parentheses first and then work my way out. Let me try that approach. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let me start from the innermost part. The innermost part is 1 + 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs. Starting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(...)\". Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There's one at the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + ... So that's the first layer. Then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. But when I look at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the number of layers is 9. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3, then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), and so on until Layer 1 is the outermost, which is multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index them from the innermost as Layer 1, so Layer 1 is 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might make more sense. So, let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each Layer i as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, adding up each part:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 total so far: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 total: 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 total: 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 total: 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me confirm each Layer computation step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again to ensure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nSo, that's 9 instances of \"1+3(\", which means there are 9 layers. So, my initial approach of computing Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach works. For example, suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, with 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me recount the layers in the original problem.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, each of these is a layer, meaning 9 layers. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize a pattern or perhaps find a formula for such expressions. Let me see if I can find a general formula for expressions of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... (1 + 3)...))). Suppose there are n layers. Then, each layer can be represented recursively as L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which would be L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before.\n\nIn general, for each layer k, L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when k = 1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor k=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for k=9, which is our case, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it more directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a good way to verify the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " To tackle this, I'll start evaluating from the innermost part and move outward. Let's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). That's the ninth layer. Let me compute that first. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is (1 + 3(...)). Since the innermost part is now 4, the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second layer from the inside is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next part is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer from the inside is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that. 3*40 = 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. So, the fourth layer is 121. Moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*121). Calculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363, and 1 + 363 = 364. So, the fifth layer is 364. Next, the sixth layer is (1 + 3*364). Let me compute that. 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, the sixth layer is 1093. Moving out another layer, the seventh layer is (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, the seventh layer is 3280. Next, the eighth layer is (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute that. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, the eighth layer is 9841. Now, the outermost layer is the first part of the original expression: 3*(...). The inner part we just computed is 9841. So, the entire expression is 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 29523. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost part: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous result. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29523. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again to be thorough.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Finally: 3*9841 = 29523. Correct.\n\nYes, each step seems accurate. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final result is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed sequentially:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Outermost: \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\boxed{29523}"

    "text": " Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me try that approach. Let's start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that result. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check: The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me define each step properly. Let me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me call the innermost expression as a\u2081, then a\u2082, a\u2083, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, looking back, there are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3, so maybe nine layers? Let me count again: Each time, starting from the innermost, there's a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outwards, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps it's eight layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: After the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the ninth layer, and moving outwards, each time we have another layer. So, maybe it's nine layers in total. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. So, let's define a\u2081 as the innermost expression: a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, moving outwards, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081. Then a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, until a\u2089, which will be the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a\u2089. Wait, no, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, perhaps I need to adjust my indexing. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first innermost. Then each layer outwards adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let me compute each layer one by one, from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out one layer, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check each step because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check with a different method. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, which might allow me to find a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can also compute this using the formula for a_n. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By systematically computing each layer and applying the formula for the nth term of the linear recurrence relation, we arrive at the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final computation**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to tackle this step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let's define each layer to make it easier. Let me label each innermost expression as E1, then the next one as E2, and so on, up to E9, which is the outermost expression. So, starting from the inside: E1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, E2 = 1 + 3*(E1). Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's E2. Now, E3 = 1 + 3*(E2). E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*(E3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*(E4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*(E5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, so E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*(E6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*(E7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Thus, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*(E8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(E9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing E9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let's check E1 through E9 again. E1: 1+3=4, correct. E2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. E3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. E4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. E5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. E6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. E7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. E8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. E9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me try computing a couple of the inner layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let's check E5: E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, E6=1+1092=1093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Thus, E7=1+3279=3280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. E8=1+9840=9841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. E9=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, seems solid.
