    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I could have used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me write down the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since we only have nine layers. But for the sake of understanding, let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed 3*(a_9) using the formula: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer using the closed-form formula. Either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiply that by 3, I get 88572. So is that the final answer? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time adding another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There's one at the very start, then each time 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each time wrapping another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections.\n\nFrom the innermost to outermost, there are 9 layers. So yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 1 + 3*Layer8, which was 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to write down each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute it step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did this earlier, I thought of it as 88572, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I wrote 88572 without the comma, which is the same number. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a direct formula for the entire expression. Since each layer is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, and the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and using the formula, I think it's safe to say that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expression again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula I derived earlier.\n\nThe formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me try to write it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nWait, but that's similar to S = 3*(1 + 3*S'), where S' is another similar expression. But actually, each layer is similar, so maybe S' = S'' = ... = a certain value. Wait, perhaps not, because each layer is one step deeper.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nWait, but that seems recursive. Let me see:\n\nIf I let S be the value of the innermost expression, then S = 1 + 3*S.\n\nWait, but in reality, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, which is what I did earlier.\n\nBut in any case, using the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrived at the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, but I think that's what I already did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using another approach, like expanding the entire expression.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with everything else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, perhaps the total can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me try to expand it:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me expand the innermost parentheses first:\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nStart with 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, as before. So, each step is building up the expression, and after nine layers, we get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nI think that's as far as I can go. I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572. Hmm, but let me verify that because 3 * 29524 is actually 88572, I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to check.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have miscalculated. Let me check again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 (from 2*3+2) 8 (from 9*3+1) 5 (from 5*3) 7 (from 2*3+1) 2 (from 4*3). So the number is 88572. That matches the other method, so I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit calculation earlier. So the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, so going back, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer up to Layer 9.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to check for any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the problem is solved correctly.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time there's a 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, up to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of '1+3's:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n2. Then moving out, each time we have another (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's count how many times 1+3 appears:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, one layer out: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Continuing, each time we have another 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each time we have a 1+3 within another 1+3, and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, so let me count how many times 1+3 is nested:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\nLayer 4: (1+3(Layer3))\nLayer 5: (1+3(Layer4))\nLayer 6: (1+3(Layer5))\nLayer 7: (1+3(Layer6))\nLayer 8: (1+3(Layer7))\nLayer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each computed as above. So, Layer9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I had 9 layers, each correctly computed. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify one more time with a different approach. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, perhaps this is a geometric series or can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, another way to approach this might be to recognize the pattern as a geometric series, but since each term is defined recursively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method confirms the result again. So, I'm certain that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I'm confident in the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. So, the general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this. Let's see. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure. For n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 using the formula and then multiply by 3 again. Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this multiplication carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues for nine layers. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, Layer 9 is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case there's a shortcut. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"(\" after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of layers: Starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 layers: Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the innermost is 1+3. So, total layers from the innermost to the outermost would be 9 layers. Wait, but according to the formula, a_n corresponds to n layers. So, if we have 9 layers, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, the formula approach confirms the manual computation. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final step is multiplying a_9 by 3: 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize, perhaps a geometric series or something similar? Because computing each layer step by step might be time-consuming, but maybe there's a formula that can be applied. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it to see if it gives the same result. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u21d2 9/2 = 3C \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for L_n and then multiplied by 3. Let me see: Since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly from multiple angles, so I'm pretty sure this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. It's a linear recurrence, and the solution can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Wait, more accurately, the solution can be found by solving the homogeneous and particular solutions. Alternatively, since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can write this as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to approach the problem, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But since the problem only had 9 layers, computing each step manually was manageable, though time-consuming. I think I've confirmed the answer through both iterative computation and the closed-form solution, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, all layers computed correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, perhaps this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in this case, we can model it as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me find the constant c such that this holds. Expanding, a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But from the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting, 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Simplify: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Subtract 3*a_{n-1} from both sides: 1 + c = 3c. Then, 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. So, the transformed sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. That's a simple geometric progression with ratio 3. So, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Compute b_1: b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1}. Then, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute that. 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500 + 540 = 59040 +9=59049. So, (9/2)*6561 = 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Then, a_9 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I were to think about this as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3, but it's a bit more involved because each term also adds 1. However, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward here. Another way to approach it is to expand the entire expression step by step, but that might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. But since I already did the step-by-step computation and verified it with the recurrence method, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute it step by step starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems to check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe it's a geometric series or something? Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9, and the total expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps there's a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's consider that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for a linear recurrence relation. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next term)}\\).

So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. It looks like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and it's multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, if I denote the innermost expression as x, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x, and so on. So, each time, the coefficient of x is multiplied by 3, and the constants are 1 + 3 + 9 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, but in this case, since there are 9 layers, maybe the total number of terms is 9, so the constants would be a geometric series with 9 terms where each term is 3^{k} for k from 0 to 8. Let me try to model this. Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me see how many layers there are. Each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Since the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around, so for 9 layers, we have 9 instances of 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the expression can be written as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with 9 layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with 8 layers, but I think I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps the number of multiplications by 3 is 9, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers, which would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the total expression is 3*(sum of 3^k from k=0 to 8) + something? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me try to model this as a sum. Let me consider that each time we have a 1 added, and each 1 is multiplied by 3^{n} where n is the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the total sum inside the outermost parentheses would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers, which would be equivalent to 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k) + ... Wait, but when I compute each layer, I get that Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then E = 3*Layer9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Which matches the earlier result. So, another way to think about it is that E = (3^{n+1} -3)/2, where n is the number of layers. Since there are 9 layers, n=9, so E=(3^{10} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523, but that's Layer9, not E. Wait, no, E is 3*Layer9, which would be 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Which is 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So that formula works. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from 1, and summed up for 9 terms, but I think the formula E=(3^{n+1}-3)/2 is correct. Let me test it with n=1: If there's only one layer, then E=3*(1+3)=3*4=12. According to the formula, E=(3^{2}-3)/2=(9-3)/2=6/2=3. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe my formula is off. Wait, when n=1, the expression is 3*(1+3)=12, but according to (3^{n+1}-3)/2, when n=1, it's (9-3)/2=3, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the formula isn't exactly that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine. From earlier, Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe the formula for E is 3*(3^{n} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. Wait, let's see: If n=1, E=3*(3^1 -1)/2=3*(3-1)/2=3*2/2=3. But when n=1, the expression is 3*(1+3)=12, which is not 3. So, that formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Wait, maybe I should model the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 9, multiplied by 3. Wait, let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. If I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4)))...). Each time, the 1 is multiplied by 3^{number of layers above it}. So, for the innermost 1, it's multiplied by 3^8, then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k) = 3*((3^9 -1)/2) = (3^{10} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523. But wait, that's Layer9, which we know is 29524. Hmm, that's off by 1. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me see: The sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. But in our case, with 9 layers, maybe the sum is up to k=8, so sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k}=(3^9 -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum)=3*((3^9 -1)/2)=(3^{10} -3)/2. But when n=9 layers, the innermost is 1+3, which is 4, which is 3^1 +1. Hmm, perhaps the formula is correct, but the way I'm applying it is off. Wait, when I computed Layer9, I got (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then E=3*29524=88572. But according to the sum formula, it's (3^{10} -3)/2=59046/2=29523, which is one less than Layer9. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum approach. Alternatively, maybe the sum approach isn't directly applicable here because each layer isn't just adding 1, but rather 1 plus 3 times the previous sum. Let me try to think recursively. Let me define S_n as the sum after n layers. Then, S_1=1+3=4. S_2=1 +3*S_1=1+12=13. S_3=1 +3*S_2=1+39=40. And so on, up to S_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which for n=9 gives S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches. Then, E=3*S_9=88572. So, that's consistent. So, perhaps the sum approach works if I consider that the expression inside is the sum S_n, and then the entire expression is 3*S_n. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*next_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to model it as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute each a_n step by step, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Each step seems logical and I don't see any miscalculations. So, I think the answer is 88572. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n is defined recursively. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve such a recurrence, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me find D. Assume a particular solution is a constant D. Then, substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations. It's interesting how both methods lead to the same answer, but the formula approach is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. For example, if there were 20 layers, computing each step would be tedious, but the formula would still work. So, I think I've confirmed that the answer is indeed 88572. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572, which is the final result.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9), which is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's say that each Layer n is defined as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 \u00d7 Layer (n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = 4\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n... and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3 \u00d7 Layer (n-1). So, solving such a recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula, which could be useful for larger numbers of layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step is manageable.\n\nBut just for knowledge, let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 \u00d7 Layer (n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3 Layer (n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = C \u00d7 3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C \u00d7 3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4:\n\n4 = C \u00d7 3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is Layer n = (3/2) \u00d7 3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, that works. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 Layer 9 = 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, everything checks out. I think I've got the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested structure from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent (1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count how many times (1+3 occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next: (1+3( ... )) where ... is Layer 1 \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then: (1+3( ... )) where ... is Layer 2 \u2192 Layer 3\n4. Continue until the outermost.\n\nLet me see how many layers there are. The expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so Layers 1 through 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, computed it as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\nLayer 4: (1+3(Layer3))\nLayer 5: (1+3(Layer4))\nLayer 6: (1+3(Layer5))\nLayer 7: (1+3(Layer6))\nLayer 8: (1+3(Layer7))\nLayer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo yes, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So my earlier computation is correct, leading to 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3n, so starting from n1 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nWait a second, this seems similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly because each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the recurrence relation is:\n\nn_k = 1 + 3*n_{k-1}\n\nWith n_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is n_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven n_k = 1 + 3*n_{k-1}, with n_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is n_k - 3*n_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form n_p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is n_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition n_1 = 4.\n\nn_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor k=1: n1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor k=2: n2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nk=3: n3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 correct.\n\nk=4: n4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nk=5: n5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nk=6: n6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nk=7: n7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nk=8: n8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nk=9: n9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, n_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, as we found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*n9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*n9, we can write:\n\nTotal =3*n9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}, and 3*1=3, so it's (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2192 same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, using the formula.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a method, just to compute it, either way is fine.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I double-checked each layer, used the formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for solving such recursions.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nThen, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I checked each layer step by step, and then also used the recurrence relation method to find the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7.

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think if that applies here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to L_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Just to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layers build up to a value of 29524 at the ninth layer.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. To solve this, I can try to find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n goes from 1 to 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using recurrence relations, which gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it sufficiently, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Plugging the recurrence into the equation: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. So, yeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which could have saved time, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, this seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might be faster. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's see the values we have: a1 = 4 a2 = 13 a3 = 40 a4 = 121 a5 = 364 a6 = 1093 a7 = 3280 a8 = 9841 a9 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, perhaps they follow a pattern related to powers of 3 or something similar. Let's see:\n\na1 = 4 = (3^2 + 1)/1 = (9 + 1)/1 = 10/1? No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1: a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n = 1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: a4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121.

Correct.\n\nn = 7: a7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: a8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n = 9, so a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we determine that the innermost value (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 87,572, but let me compute it again carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the digits are 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that's 87,572. Wait, but when I write it down, it's 87,572. Hmm, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 30,000 *3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So 30,000*3=90,000. Then subtract 476*3=1,428. So 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers. Wait, no, 29524 is less than 30,000 by 476, so 30,000 - 29524 = 476. So 29524 *3 = (30,000 - 476)*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. But earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check which one is correct. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 87,572. Wait, but using the other method, I got 88,572. There's a mistake here. Let me see where I went wrong. Wait, 30,000 - 29524 is actually 30,000 - 29,524 = 476. So 29,524 + 476 = 30,000. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. But when I did the digit multiplication, I got 87,572. So, which one is correct? Let me check 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +60=88,560; +12=88,572. So, correct answer is 88,572. So where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? Let me check again: 29,524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it down: 8 (from 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). So that's 88,572. Wait, but when I wrote it earlier, I thought it was 87,572. I must have miscounted the digits. So, the correct final answer is 88,572. Therefore, the computation is correct, and the final result is 88,572. So, to recap, each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation: Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, each a_n is built from the previous term. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. At n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. At n=0, perhaps we can define a_0 as the base case. Wait, but in our case, the innermost term is a_1=4, which is 1 +3*1, so perhaps a_0=1, then a_1=1 +3*a_0=1 +3*1=4. So, a_0=1. Then, using the recurrence a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1. So, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in n=0: a_0=1= A*3^0 + B= A + B. And for n=1: a_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) A + B =1 2) 3A + B=4 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (3A + B) - (A + B) =4 -1 => 2A=3 => A=3/2. Then, from equation 1: 3/2 + B=1 => B=1 -3/2= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost term is a_1=4, and each layer adds another n. Wait, actually, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Wait, no, let me clarify: The innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524. So, using the formula, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's consistent with our earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step to ensure I didn't make an error in computing the layers. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Therefore, equating terms: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this confirms the result I got step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So yes, 29524 *3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify if I correctly computed each layer. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., as I computed before. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A =4 +1/2 =9/2. Thus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the value step by step or derive a closed-form formula. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form formula for a_n, which could help in computing a_9 more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 30,000 * 3 is 90,000, and 29524 is close to 30,000, so 29524 * 3 should be around 88,572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 40000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 + 40000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Wait, that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428. Let me compute 90000 - 1428: 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let's see: Starting from the right, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Then Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2), and so on, until Layer9, which is the outermost. So, yes, 9 layers. So my calculation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nWe have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1).\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nTo find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for each layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Okay, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait a second, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*r^n + b, where a and b are constants. Let's see if that works. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Wait, actually, it's L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{hom} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed earlier. So, that seems to confirm the result. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to think about it. Instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used the closed-form formula to find L_9 and then multiplied by 3. But since I already computed it step by step, it's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. So, to recap: The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the inside out, I found that the innermost layer was 4, then each subsequent layer built upon that, eventually leading to Layer 9 being 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gave the final result of 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula for the nth layer, which also led to the same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches yielded the same result, so I feel confident that this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer.

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.

Correct.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is defined recursively, it might not be straightforward. However, computing each layer step by step seems manageable and less error-prone.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have nine layers, so a_9 would be the value before multiplying by 3. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Let me see if there's a formula for a linear recurrence relation like this. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value before the final multiplication by 3 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence because of the constant term 1. Let me write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is defined as L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula is much faster and less error-prone. I think I've got it right. To recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, I could derive a formula for each layer, compute the 9th layer, and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer, which is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).
