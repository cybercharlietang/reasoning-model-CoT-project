    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again. Let me write it out properly: 29524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), then 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), and 2 (units). So, 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that multiplication because I might have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, but let me check if I did each layer correctly because 88572 seems a bit large. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So, each time, I'm computing the next layer by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, for example, if the expression was 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2014 that's three layers. Let me compute that manually.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, using my method:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 3). But in the smaller example I described, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which would be 3*(Layer 3). But wait, in my smaller example, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I have three layers, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, then the expression is 3*40 = 120.\n\nBut wait, if I compute the smaller expression step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, in this case, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 2), which is 3*13=39, not 3*(Layer 3). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the original problem by considering Layer 9 as the outermost when it's actually Layer 8?\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers again. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3, the expression is:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\" terms:\n\n1. 1 + 3(...)\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1 + 3, which is the ninth one. So, when I compute the layers, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, in the smaller example, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) would have three layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, and then the outermost expression is 3*40 = 120. But when I computed it earlier, I thought it was 3*(Layer 2) = 39. That inconsistency suggests I'm miscounting the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the smaller example, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2014 the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1: 4. Then, moving out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. But the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 3) = 3*40 = 120. But when I computed it earlier, I thought it was 39. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, in the smaller example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then the outermost is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and then the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. But when I thought I computed it as 39 earlier, I must have made a mistake. So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, and the outermost expression is 3*(Layer n), where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, I had nine layers, so Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, with three layers, it's 3*(Layer 3) = 120, which is correct. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the smaller example earlier when I thought it was 39. Let me compute it again: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yes, that's correct. So, my initial approach was correct.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, with nine layers, the final answer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me denote the value of Layer k as L_k. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, for k >= 2.\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition: when k=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recursive formula: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A = 3/2 into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_k = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with k=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn the original problem, we have nine layers, so k=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the formula gives L_k as (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, so for k=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times \\) the value of Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7. 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. 2 (thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. 9 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2. 2 (hundred thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So putting it all together: 87, 75, 72, but wait, let me write it correctly: The digits from right to left are 2,7,5,7,8. Wait, that would be 87572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the number is 87,572? Wait, 8 followed by 7, then 5, then 7, then 2. So 87,572? Wait, that seems high. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 2+2=4, 9+9=18, 5+5=10, 2+2=4, 4+4=8. So that's 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute: 59048 + 29524: 8+4=12, carry 1. 4+2=6 +1=7. 0+5=5. 9+9=18, carry 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. 5+ nothing=5. So 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers manually to ensure I didn't make an addition error. Let's compute Layer 3 again: Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Wait, but I have a feeling that the number might be larger, but perhaps not. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this without computing each layer manually. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think: Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. To double-check, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, the computation is accurate. So, the problem is solved by recognizing the pattern, using the recurrence relation, finding the closed-form formula, and then computing the value for n=9, then multiplying by 3.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this recurrence relation, we can derive a formula for each layer, compute the outermost layer, and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Continue this up to Layer 9.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The layers follow a recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solve the recurrence to find a closed-form formula:\n   - a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\n4. **Compute Layer 9**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without having to compute each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, but since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify it with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression.\n2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, working outward one layer at a time.\n3. Verify each step to avoid arithmetic errors.\n4. Notice the pattern and derive a general formula using recurrence relations.\n5. Apply the formula to compute the result directly.\n6. Confirm that both methods give the same result, ensuring the correctness of the answer.\n\nThis approach helped me manage the complexity of the problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts and then using mathematical reasoning to find a more efficient solution method.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer by substituting the value of the previous layer.\n\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so multiply 29524 by 3.\n\n   - 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   Recognizing the pattern, we derive a formula for the nth layer using a recurrence relation. The general term for the nth layer is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For Layer 9, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result, 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*(Layer 9) again:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking down the nested expressions from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that Layer 9 is 29524.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression to see if it matches. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me think about it. Suppose I have a general form: Let\u2019s define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent term is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. So, starting with a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4: 4 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a\u2081 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a\u2082 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the ninth term, a\u2089, would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, and the formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's see: L1 = 4 = (3^(2) - 1)/2. Wait, 3^2 = 9, (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. L2=13= (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. L3= (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. L4= (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, it seems that Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me test that: For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4, which is L1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is L2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is L3. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, L9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the outermost expression is 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ). Let me compute that directly: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 )= 3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and propagate outward. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}\n\nA particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got it now. The key was to recognize the pattern and either compute each layer step by step or find a formula for the nth layer, which in this case turned out to be a geometric progression.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I saw the original problem, it was written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). Let me count how many 3s are there after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, so after the initial 3, there are 8 more 3s, making it 9 layers in total. But when I was computing, I had Layer 1 as the innermost, and Layer 9 as the outermost, which would correspond to the first 3 in the expression. Wait, maybe I got the layers reversed. Let me clarify: The innermost expression is the last 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that, so Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my approach was correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or check with a smaller version to see if my approach is correct. Let's try a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, let's compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the larger problem should give the correct result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify RHS: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, LHS: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total. Wait, actually, let's see: The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is computed as 1 + 3*Layer 8, and so on, with Layer 1 being the innermost. So, if Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, then Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Thus, Layer 9 = L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: The entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, but since it's only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable. But just to be thorough, let me check if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by computing the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. Let me check each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, let me see: Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer was Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1 in the formula. Then Layer 2 is a_2 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 = 59049, and (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree. So, I'm confident that's the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me verify one of the layers again. Let's pick Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279.

Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe know B = -1/2, so:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.

So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term of 3^k, where k increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Yes, that's consistent with the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40.\n\nSo, indeed, each layer n corresponds to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nMultiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, multiple approaches confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer now. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation and the formula for the sum of a geometric series helped confirm the result. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a geometric series can simplify the computation instead of calculating each layer step by step.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a way to express the entire original expression in terms of a geometric series without computing each layer. Let me try that.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost part as S, which is 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*S. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression:\n\nLet me try to write the entire expression in terms of a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nBut as we saw, each Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is a geometric series.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, no, actually, each layer is the sum up to that point. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, Layer 1: sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nSo, Layer n: sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9: sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire original expression as 3 times a sum, I can express it as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n(3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\n3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to express it, and it gives the same result.\n\nThis approach is more elegant because it directly uses the formula for the sum of a geometric series, avoiding the need to compute each layer step by step. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns and applying formulas can simplify complex-looking problems.\n\nIn summary, whether by computing each layer step by step, using a recurrence relation, or recognizing the entire expression as a geometric series, the result is consistent: 88572. It's always reassuring to cross-verify using different methods to ensure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing this as a geometric series, we can compute the sum efficiently.\n\nThe innermost expression is \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Each subsequent layer adds another term of \\(3^k\\). The entire expression can be represented as a geometric series with 10 terms (from \\(3^0\\) to \\(3^9\\)).\n\nThe sum of the geometric series is \\(\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this sum by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

But just to be thorough, let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make any multiplication errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let me compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I did before. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. This seems similar to a geometric sequence, but it's not exactly because each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to see the pattern.\n\nLet me compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2? Let me check:\n\nFrom a_1 to a_2: 4*3 = 12; 12 - (-1) = 13? Wait, 12 +1 =13.\n\nWait, 4*3 +1=13. Similarly, 13*3 +1=40? 13*3=39, 39+1=40. Yes, that's the pattern. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nYes, that's the recurrence relation. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4. Wait, but let's see: n starts at 1, so a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1= A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for all layers. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a formula, and even used it to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again to be sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = Let's add step by step: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer is 88572.

Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each operation. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, Layer 9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L(9)=29524, then 3*L(9)=88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula to ensure it aligns. Let's say n=4: L(4) should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's exactly what I got before. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost part as x. Wait, but since each layer is similar, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to write it out. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. But that's the same as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight layers. Wait, but maybe I can find a relation where E = 3*(1 + E/3). Hmm, but that might not directly apply here because the nesting is finite. Wait, if it were infinite, I could set up an equation, but since it's finite with nine layers, perhaps the geometric series approach is more involved. Alternatively, since I already have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, E =3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Alternatively, maybe I can expand the entire expression step by step, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each layer as adding another power of 3. Let me see: The innermost term is 1 +3 =4=3^1 +1. Wait, no, 1 +3=4=3 +1. The next layer is 1 +3*4=13=3^2 + something. Let me see: 3^2=9, 13=9 +4. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe each layer is 3^{n} + ... Let me check the values again: Layer 1:4=3 +1=3^1 +1 Layer 2:13=9 +4=3^2 +4 Layer 3:40=27 +13=3^3 +13 Layer 4:121=81 +40=3^4 +40 Wait, but that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe each a_n =3*a_{n-1} +1. Which is the recurrence relation we had earlier. So, the solution is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=88572. I think that's solid. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3. Let's compute that step by step: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, 3*29524=88572.

So putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first. 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, 9+9=18, 2+2=4.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as a1, then a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. Then the total expression is 3*a9. So, each a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a(n). The recurrence relation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, with a(1) = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1), whose solution is a(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula for the geometric series, I end up with the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression step by step.

Hmm, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps seem correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach gives the same result. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). Let me consider the innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find the solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. The innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the outermost layer, which is layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, the total expression can be thought of as 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Thus, the total is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

But since I don't have a calculator, let me compute it another way.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the correct result is 88,572, which means my digit-by-digit multiplication must have had an error in the placement of digits.\n\nWait, perhaps when I did the digit-by-digit, I miscounted the places. Let me try again, carefully:\n\n29524 is:\n\n2 (ten thousands)\n9 (thousands)\n5 (hundreds)\n2 (tens)\n4 (units)\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 (units) *3=12. So, units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext, 2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext, 5 (hundreds) *3=15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext, 9 (thousands) *3=27 +1=28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext, 2 (ten thousands) *3=6 +2=8. Ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from ten thousands to units: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752, but that contradicts the sum method which gives 88,572. There's a problem here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me check the place values again.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigit positions from right: units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands.\n\nSo:\n\nPosition 1 (units): 4\n\nPosition 2 (tens): 2\n\nPosition 3 (hundreds): 5\n\nPosition 4 (thousands): 9\n\nPosition 5 (ten thousands): 2\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3, each digit's product affects the corresponding position.\n\nSo:\n\n4*3=12: Position 1: 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: Position 2:7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15: Position3:5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: Position4:8, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: Position5:8, carryover0.\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\nPosition5:8 (ten thousands)\n\nPosition4:8 (thousands)\n\nPosition3:7 (hundreds)\n\nPosition2:5 (tens)\n\nPosition1:2 (units)\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would be 88,752, but the sum method says it's 88,572. I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me list the digits correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits when writing them down. Let's list them step by step:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit and handling carryovers, the digits from right to left are:\n\nPosition1 (units):2\n\nPosition2 (tens):7\n\nPosition3 (hundreds):5\n\nPosition4 (thousands):8\n\nPosition5 (ten thousands):8\n\nSo, writing them from left to right (highest place to lowest), it's 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88,752. But when I added each digit's product, I got 88,572. This is confusing. There must be a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps the digit positions are being mixed up. Let me try another approach: write down the multiplication step by step.\n\nLet me write 29524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down7, carryover0.\n\n5*3=15. Write down5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down8, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88,752. But according to the sum method, it's 88,572. There's a conflict here, which suggests that I made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me go back to the original problem to make sure I computed each layer correctly.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nEach layer starts with 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(Layer2)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*(Layer3)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*(Layer4)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*(Layer5)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*(Layer6)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*(Layer7)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*(Layer8)=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, so according to this, Layer9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572, which matches the sum method but contradicts the digit-by-digit method where I thought it was 88,752. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me check the multiplication again, carefully.\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\n29524\n\nx    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7. Write down7, carryover0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15. Write down5, carryover1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28. Write down8, carryover2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8. Write down8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left:2,7,5,8,8. But when written from left to right, it's 8,8,7,5,2, which is 88,752. But the sum method says it's 88,572. I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum method. Let me recalculate the sum:\n\n20000*3=60,000\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them step by step:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the digit-by-digit method must have an error in the way I wrote down the digits. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps when I wrote down the digits after multiplying, I misaligned the place values. Let me think: when I multiply 29524 by 3, the result should be 88,572, not 88,752. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach by misplacing the digits. Let me try writing it again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n- Units:4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover1\n\n- Tens:2*3=6+1=7 \u21927, carryover0\n\n- Hundreds:5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1\n\n- Thousands:9*3=27+1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6+2=8 \u21928, carryover0\n\nSo, the digits are:\n\nTen-thousands:8\n\nThousands:8\n\nHundreds:7\n\nTens:5\n\nUnits:2\n\nWait, that would be 88,752, but the correct sum is 88,572. I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me check with another method. Let me compute 29524 *3 as (30,000 - 476) *3.\n\n30,000 *3=90,000\n\n476*3=1,428\n\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428=88,572. There we go. So, the correct result is 88,572, which means that in my digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have misplaced the digits, leading to the incorrect 88,752. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier by misaligning the digits, leading to confusion. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. Then subtract (30000 - 29524) * 3. 30000 - 29524 = 476. So 476 * 3 = 1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which is what I got earlier. So, to find a closed-form solution, let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make an arithmetic error. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's good. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as calculated before. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I should verify each layer again. Let's go through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step results.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, I could consider that each layer is following a pattern, maybe a geometric series or something, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a linear recurrence. Let me think if there's a formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Now, since in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer, but using the formula. However, since the problem is given with 9 layers, and I had to compute each step, maybe the step-by-step approach is more straightforward for someone just starting out. Either way, the answer is 88572. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the inside out, I found that the innermost layer is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous, leading up to the ninth layer being 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I also verified this using the recurrence relation formula, which gave the same answer, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we compute each nested layer from the inside out:\n\n1.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number. Did I compute each layer correctly? Let me go back and verify each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start without computing each layer, but since the number of layers isn't too large (only 9), computing each layer step by step was manageable. But it's good to know that there's a formula in case the number of layers is larger. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for 9 layers, step-by-step computation is feasible.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me try to see if there's a pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI can see that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more efficiently.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L(n) = (L(0) - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). But wait, in this case, a is 3, which is greater than 1, so 1 - a is negative, but let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is:\n\nIf a \u2260 1, then L(n) = (L(0) - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a).\n\nIn our case, L(1) = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider L(0) as the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so L(0) = 4, then L(1) = 1 + 3*L(0) = 13, and so on up to L(8) being the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, so if I consider L(0) = 4, then L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to L(8) = 29524.\n\nThen, the expression is 3*L(8) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the recurrence formula, we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nGiven L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(0) = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(0) = 4: 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this for n=0: L(0) = (9*1 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=1: (9*3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=2: (9*9 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=3: (9*27 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n goes up to 8 because L(0) is the innermost. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which we called L1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So if we have 9 layers, that would correspond to n=8 in our formula because L(0) is the first layer. Wait, maybe I got confused with the indexing.\n\nWait, in our earlier calculation, we had L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, ..., L9 = 29524.\n\nBut according to the formula, L(n) = (9*3^n - 1)/2. If n=0, L0=4; n=1, L1=13; n=2, L2=40, etc.\n\nWait, so if I have 9 layers, that would mean n goes up to 8, because starting from n=0 to n=8, that's 9 terms.\n\nWait, so L(8) would be (9*3^8 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo L(8) = (9*6561 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 9*6561: 6561*9: Let's compute 6561*10=65610, minus 6561: 65610 - 6561 = 59049.\n\nSo L(8) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(8) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L(n) = 3*(9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, n=8, so 3*L(8) = 3*(9*3^8 -1)/2 = (27*3^8 - 3)/2.\n\nBut 3^8 is 6561, so 27*6561: Let's compute that.\n\n27*6561: 27 is 3^3, so 3^3*3^8 = 3^(3+8)=3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 27*6561 = 177147.\n\nThen, 3*L(8) = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich again gives the same result. So, the formula works, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, without using the formula, computing each layer step by step as I did earlier also leads to the same result. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 =15, write down 5, carry 1.\n- 9*3 =27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_i \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( L_9 \\) is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\n1.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing each layer. Let me go back step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the earlier layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the computation up to Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me think if there's a better way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which resembles a geometric series or something that can be modeled with recursion.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_n represents the value at the nth layer. Then, according to the structure, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is non-homogeneous, and its general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 as per the original expression: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula, the entire expression can be seen as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify the exponents:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147, subtract 3: 177147 - 3 = 177144.\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Wait, but let me verify my calculations because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me check the layers again to see if I computed each correctly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B, so we have: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as a geometric series multiplied by 3.

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3, leading to the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, no, the digits should be from right to left as we compute. So, the units digit is 2, then tens, hundreds, etc. So, 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. Let me verify that with another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down as 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, that matches. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is correct. Because 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. So, Layer 6 is 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. So, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct, Layer 7 is 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct, Layer 8 is 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct, Layer 9 is 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I'm computing the next layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, this is a geometric series, perhaps? Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see.\n\nIn general, each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 should be 4. Using the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 should be 13. Formula: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are nine layers, so each time we're adding another 3*(...). So, expanding this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to express this as a sum.\n\nIf I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider each term as a_n, as I did before, and then S = 3*a_9, where a_9 is the ninth layer.\n\nSince I've already determined that a_9 = 29524, then S = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, but I think the approach I took earlier is sufficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is equivalent to 3^{n} times something. Let me see if I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1.\n\nWait, 3^2 is 9, but 13 is 9 + 4. Hmm, not exactly matching. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, let me see: Each time, when you have 1 + 3*(previous), which is like adding 1 and then scaling the previous term by 3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nIf I unroll the entire expression, starting from the innermost, it's like:\n\nStarting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut perhaps if I express a_n in terms of 3^{n}.\n\nFrom the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, S = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the entire expression as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. So, each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, except for the innermost layer, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nSo, perhaps S can be expressed as a sum where each term is 3^{k} for k from 0 to 9, but I need to adjust for the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the entire expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to write out the expression:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1s and the number of 3s.\n\nWait, each time you have a 1 and a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, perhaps when expanded, each term is 3^k where k is from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure. Let me try expanding a few layers to see.\n\nCompute a few layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, S = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nEach layer adds another 3^k term. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*4.\n\nBut 4 is 1 + 3, so Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, so each layer adds another term of 3^{n}.\n\nWait, so Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, so Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, but that's only if each layer is the sum up to 3^{n}, but in our problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is the same as the sum up to 3^{n}.\n\nWait, so if Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, then Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 9 is 29524, and the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we computed earlier: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing the expression using a different approach. Maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nSince each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, except for the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, the entire expression can be seen as a sum where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=9, but scaled by the number of layers.\n\nWait, no, because each layer adds another 3^k term, but the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I unroll the entire expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding this without using the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous computations.\n\nI think I've checked this enough times, and each method leads me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3\\) times the result of Layer 9:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
