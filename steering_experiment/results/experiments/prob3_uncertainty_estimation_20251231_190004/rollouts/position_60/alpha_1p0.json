    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression had nine layers, but when I counted earlier, I might have miscounted. Let me check the original problem again: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, then each (1+3... is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3... So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first (1+3 is Layer 1.\n   - Then each subsequent (1+3 is another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again. Let me write down the structure:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). That's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3...:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. Next: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) \u2192 Layer 9\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, when I counted earlier, I thought the innermost was Layer 1, and then each outer layer was numbered up to Layer 9, which would be correct. So, perhaps my calculation is correct. But to make sure, let me check each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a different approach. Perhaps this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nBut let me see. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write:\n\na_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c), for some constant c.\n\nExpanding: a_n + c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 3c\n\nRearranging: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c + 1 - c\n\nTo eliminate the constant term, set 3c + 1 - c = 0 \u2192 2c + 1 = 0 \u2192 c = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n + (-1/2) = 3*(a_{n-1} + (-1/2))\n\nThus, the sequence b_n = a_n - 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4, so b_1 = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2.\n\nThen, b_n = (7/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nTherefore, a_n = b_n + 1/2 = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (7*3^{8} + 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561\n\nSo, a_9 = (7*6561 + 1)/2 = (45927 + 1)/2 = 45928/2 = 22964\n\nWait, but earlier, I computed a_9 as 29524, which is different from 22964. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in my initial calculations. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step computation, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nBut according to the recurrence relation, a_9 should be 22964. So, I must have made a mistake in my step-by-step calculation. Let me check each layer again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers, making sure that each layer corresponds correctly.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...). Each (1+3 is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer 3\n... and so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but according to the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, which would make a_9 as per the recurrence relation. But according to my step-by-step, I had a_9 as 29524, but the recurrence formula gives a_9 as 22964. So, I must have made a mistake in my step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me recompute each layer carefully:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12 \u2192 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9 \u2192 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840 \u2192 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 2\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write down 9, carry over 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number: thousands digit 9, hundreds digit 8, tens digit 4, units digit 1.\n\nSo, 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841=29523. Then, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence formula, a_9 should be (7*3^8 + 1)/2 = (7*6561 +1)/2 = (45927 +1)/2=45928/2=22964. But according to my step-by-step, it's 29524. There's a conflict here. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence formula. Let me double-check the recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nBut in the general solution, I set b_n = a_n + c, and found that c = -1/2, leading to b_n = 7/2 * 3^{n-1}.\n\nThus, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (7/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nWait, earlier I thought a_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2, but perhaps that's incorrect. Let me rederive the recurrence properly.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c).\n\nExpanding: a_n + c = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 3c.\n\nRearranged: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c + 1 - c.\n\nTo eliminate the constant term, set 3c + 1 - c = 0 \u2192 2c +1 = 0 \u2192 c = -1/2.\n\nThus, b_n = a_n - 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4, then b_1 = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2.\n\nTherefore, b_n = (7/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nHence, a_n = b_n + (-1/2) = (7/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (7/2)*3^8 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^8 = 6561.\n\nThus, a_9 = (7/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (7*6561)/2 - 1/2 = (45927 - 1)/2 = 45926/2 = 22963.\n\nWait, that's 22963, but according to my step-by-step, it's 29524. So, clearly, there's a mistake in either the step-by-step or the recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial condition is wrong. Let me check the first few layers using the recurrence formula.\n\nUsing the recurrence formula:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (7/2)*3 - 1/2 = 21/2 - 1/2 = 20/2 = 10. But in my step-by-step, a_2 was 13. That's a problem.\n\nWait, so something is wrong here. Let me check the recurrence derivation again.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial condition is a_1 = 4, so b_1 = a_1 - c = 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nWait, earlier I thought b_n = a_n - c, where c = -1/2, so b_1 = a_1 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Then, since b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, then b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nThus, a_n = b_n + c = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me recast this.\n\nIf we set b_n = a_n - c, then:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThen,\n\nb_n + c = 1 + 3*(b_{n-1} + c)\n\nExpanding:\n\nb_n + c = 1 + 3*b_{n-1} + 3c\n\nRearranged:\n\nb_n = 3*b_{n-1} + 3c + 1 - c\n\nSet 3c + 1 - c = 0 \u2192 2c +1 = 0 \u2192 c = -1/2.\n\nThus, b_n = 3*b_{n-1}.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4, then b_1 = a_1 - c = 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nTherefore, a_n = b_n - c = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - (-1/2) = (9/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, for a_1, let's compute:\n\na_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (9/2)*1 + 1/2 = 9/2 + 1/2 = 10/2 = 5. But in reality, a_1 is 4, not 5. So, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach to the recurrence is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I should model it differently. Let's approach it again.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C = 1 + 3C \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6)/2 - 1/2 = 729/2 - 1/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7)/2 - 1/2 = 2187/2 - 1/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8)/2 - 1/2 = 6561/2 - 1/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9)/2 - 1/2 = 19683/2 - 1/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nAh, so my initial step-by-step was correct, and the mistake was in the earlier application of the recurrence formula where I incorrectly set the particular solution. So, the correct general solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nThus, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more to be absolutely sure.\n\nCompute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think my initial step-by-step was correct, and the earlier confusion with the recurrence formula was due to an incorrect particular solution assumption. The correct particular solution leads to a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives a_9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when you have repeated multiplications like this, there's a formula or a pattern you can use instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe it's a geometric series or something. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, and so on up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840 +0=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them again: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 =4. Then, each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer manually, then used a recurrence relation to find a general formula, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

So, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Let me confirm that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but let me think again about the structure. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(result of previous). So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for a_9. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the final result is 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I expand it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))). But I think the approach I took earlier is more straightforward, computing each layer step by step. Another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, and we've found a closed-form expression, perhaps we can generalize this for any number of layers. But in this case, since we have 9 layers, it's manageable to compute step by step. Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer once more to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct. So, after carefully going through each step and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Alternatively, this could be represented as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general term is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. This might be more efficient if the number of layers were larger, but for nine layers, both methods work. So, I think I've confirmed it in two different ways: step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage it without getting lost. Each time, I just computed the innermost parentheses first and worked my way outwards, which made the problem manageable. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because of the multiplication by 3 each time. I can see how quickly the numbers add up, which is why the final result is so large despite starting with small numbers.\n\nAnother way to think about this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but since there are nine layers, it's probably quicker to compute each step manually.

So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, starting from L1 = 4. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let's assume the solution is of the form Ln = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but all our layers so far have been integers. Maybe this is okay, but let's see. Now, using the initial condition L1 = 4. Let's compute A and B. Wait, but in our case, L1 is the first term, which is 4. So, when n=1, Ln = 4. Plugging into our assumed solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. But we already found that B = -1/2. So, 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with our computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, we can compute it as L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives us 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*L9, and L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1, 9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, carry over 1, 2 + 2=4 +1=5. So, that's 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using a formula involving geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., as we computed before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's think about that. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have multiple layers, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what I calculated earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k and c are constants, can be found using standard techniques. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the value at each layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. Either way, the result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carried 2 is 8. So putting it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So the result is 88572.

Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

But wait, let me check Layer 9 again because that's the last step before multiplying by 3. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, writing it out: 9841 * 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. That's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors. Let's go back to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 was 13, so 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me find D first by considering the steady-state solution, where a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Plugging into the equation: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace the layers to ensure I didn't make an error in any step.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general term. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into this general solution. L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSimplify: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the initial terms, which is a good sign.\n\nTherefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to see if I made an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also find another equation by considering the recurrence relation. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Starting from the innermost layer, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait a minute, that looks like powers of 3. Let's see: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1. a_2 = 13 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0. a_3 = 40 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0. So, each a_n is the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 up to 3^n. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is exactly the closed-form formula I derived earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, regardless of the method I use, whether iterative computation, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all methods point to the same number. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can recognize a pattern where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The closed-form solution for the nth layer is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the 9th layer, this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps. Let me see if I can represent this as a sum. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, 0 = 2B + 1 => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me see if I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct. So, summarizing my steps: 1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Computed each layer step by step, confirming each result as I went. 3. Derived a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations. 4. Applied the formula to compute the 9th layer. 5. Multiplied the result by 3 to get the final answer. 6. Verified the result using an alternative method (direct computation of the formula) to ensure correctness. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Wait, but let me verify my layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. However, if the number of layers were larger, we might need a formula. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, the homogeneous solution is straightforward. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*3^{n} + constant. To find the constant, we can solve for the particular solution. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then verified using a formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value at each level. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated 9 times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, for n=1: a1=4. n=2: a2=1+3*4=13. n=3: a3=1+3*13=40. Yes, that's the same as before. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so the solution can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try to solve it using the recurrence relation formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. When n=1, a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I went through both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, and both gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Wait, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it more carefully. 29,524 * 3: Break it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.

But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each layer's value. Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n, which might make it easier to compute for multiple layers without manually computing each step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, this method also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to expanding a geometric series. Let me try to represent the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Wait, but actually, since each layer is similar, maybe we can express E in terms of itself? Hmm, but with nine layers, it's a finite number, so it's a finite nested expression. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found a formula for a_n, perhaps we don't need to go further. But just to explore, if I consider the expression without the outermost 3, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, E = 88,572. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series\u2014we arrive at the same final answer. It's always good to verify using multiple methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can get quite large. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3(1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So after the first 3(1+3, there are 8 more opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So total layers would be 9. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if that's the case. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is (3^{k} - 1)/2 for k layers, but in this case, since we have 9 layers, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

So yes, the result is 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with a different approach. Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each layer can be expressed recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a finite number of layers, maybe computing each step is simpler. Alternatively, recognizing that each step is a geometric series? Let me see: Let's see, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, expanding this, a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40? Wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, no, actually, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is correct. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches a_3. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Okay, so that matches my previous calculation. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition. It looks similar to a geometric series, but not exactly because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Wait, actually, that's a recursive relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1) when starting from a_0 = 0. Wait, let me check that. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d, with a_0 = initial term. The solution is a_n = (d/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + a_0*(r^{n}). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, r = 3, d = 1, and a_0 = 1 (since the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, which would be a_1). Wait, no, let me think again. Let's index the layers correctly. If Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the final answer is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my step-by-step computation, let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the numbers add up. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, it's similar to a geometric series but with an added constant. The formula for such a series is well-known, and I used that to derive the general solution, which also confirmed the result.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified my work enough times to be sure that the answer is correct. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. L_3=1 +3*L_2=1 +3*13=40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. It seems like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. Let's see if we can find another condition. For n=0, if we consider it, L_0 would be undefined in the original problem, but perhaps we can extrapolate. Wait, maybe it's better to solve the recurrence properly. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C - 1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total, so Layer 9. Therefore, Layer 9= L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10=59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2:59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2:177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form expression. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer:88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made an error in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct.

So Layer 6:1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So Layer 7:1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840, +0=9840. So Layer 8:1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9:1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute the entire expression step by step again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's try computing it from the inside out, step by step, writing down each result. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. So the innermost part is 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13. Next layer:1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40. Next:1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121. Next:1 +3*(121)=1 +363=364. Next:1 +3*(364)=1 +1092=1093. Next:1 +3*(1093)=1 +3279=3280. Next:1 +3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841. Next:1 +3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So yes, that's consistent. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this, recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assuming a particular solution is a constant B, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what we computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3.

Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, leading to a geometric progression, but using the recurrence relation approach seems solid. It's always good to check with a different method to ensure that the answer is correct, especially when dealing with repetitive computations that are easy to mess up. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result as manually computing each layer, which gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find the value of the innermost expression and substitute it into the next layer until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
