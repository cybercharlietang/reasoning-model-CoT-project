    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, which is Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Moving to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 1, so the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is just a multiple of the previous one, and since each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it grows exponentially, which explains why the numbers get so large quickly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer's value is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric sequence or something that can be modeled with recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Wait, actually, L(1) is 4, L(2)=13, L(3)=40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Moving outward, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I'm multiplying large numbers, I might slip up. Let me verify Layer 9 first. Layer 9 was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400. 29,400 + 120 is 29,520. 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. That seems correct.

So, 20,000 * 3 is 60,000; 9,000 * 3 is 27,000; 500 * 3 is 1,500; 20 * 3 is 60; 4 * 3 is 12.

Hmm, but I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a general formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (-1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor Layer 1: n=1\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: n=5\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: n=6\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: n=7\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: n=8\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: n=9\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works perfectly for each layer. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly computed a_9 using the formula, which gives me 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the final result in terms of the formula. Let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3, so 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was recognizing the pattern in the nested expressions and finding a general formula to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified using a recurrence relation. By recognizing the pattern, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Formula**: Solving the recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Computation**: Multiply a_9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process. Hmm, looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can model this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. So, f(1) = 4, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). If f(n) = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplifying the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4. So, f(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, f(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. This method might have saved time if I had noticed the pattern earlier, but since I was working step by step, it was a good exercise to compute each layer manually to see how it builds up. In any case, both methods lead to the same final answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Plugging in Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72.

Let's check 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192. 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.

Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 29524*3 another way. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3.

Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; so adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to mess up with such large numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 in a different way to verify. Let's do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that gives me 88572. Yes, that's the same as before. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer, I was able to compute each step without getting lost. It's interesting how each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. It's almost like a geometric progression or something, but since it's nested, it's more of a repeated multiplication and addition. Anyway, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer after double-checking my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 3 is then 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. I computed each layer step by step, and each time, the numbers got larger, which makes sense because we're dealing with exponents of 3 essentially. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think I did everything right, but just to be thorough, let me verify the final multiplication: 29524 *3. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

For Layer 9: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1+29523=29524. Correct.

Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

Yes, that matches. So, I think I did it correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from 4, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous value). So, each step was just a multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially. So, yeah, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But according to the general solution, L_n should also be A*3^n + B. Therefore, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, moving out, each next 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them: 1+3(...), which is Layer 1. Then, the next is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and then we multiply by 3. So, my calculation seems to be correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach, perhaps looking for a pattern or a formula. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a jump. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, so far, the numbers are 4, 13, 40, 121. I notice each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Alternatively, I can just compute each layer step by step since there aren't that many layers. Let's proceed. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Let me verify this with another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That confirms the result. So, the final value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer by substituting the previous result, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems consistent. The numbers grew rapidly, which is expected because each time we're multiplying by 3, leading to exponential growth. So, after computing each layer up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check one or two layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's verify Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Everything checks out. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost parentheses.

Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that's consistent. So, the total is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or something. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = r^{n-1} * a_1 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me recall the exact formula. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, so maybe the indexing is a bit different. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each a_n as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

    "text": " Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should write it out properly. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, that gives 88,572. So, the entire expression equals 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the result is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), and since a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula approach, I also get 88,572. This confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).

    "text": " Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, this seems to be growing quite quickly. Let me proceed to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, let me compute that: Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. The formula for a_n would be a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, if I use the formula a_n = (3^n - 1)/2, let's see if that works. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I have the wrong formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I've got it. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's see, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is let's see, 800*3 is 2400, 41*3 is 123, so 2400 + 123 = 2523. So 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.

So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like each step is following the formula: next_layer = 1 + 3 * previous_layer. Starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. This seems to be a geometric progression, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I can model it with a formula to see if there's a pattern. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on up to a_9. I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. To find a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 =4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down again for accuracy. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, which can throw off the entire result.

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those up: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. I can break it down as 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can compute a couple of layers again. Let's check Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it as 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1, so Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1, so Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So 9000 + 840 is 9840. Add 1, so Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So the final result should be 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous part is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, let me verify one more layer with the formula. Let's take n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Which is correct as per my earlier computation. So, the formula holds, and thus the final result should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, the expression can be simplified, leading to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Good, moving on. Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2: 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them together: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those up: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them together: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Therefore, 3*29524 equals 88572. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value was computed step by step, and finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result 88572.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is right. I didn't see any mistakes in the steps, and each layer built upon the previous one correctly. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. So Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: Well, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4 correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as follows: 29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 +24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 +72 = 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

    "text": " Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Let me break it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, and 3*24 is 72. Adding 60000 + 27000 gives 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yes, because 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 3*120 is 360, 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12, so 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let me confirm that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Yep, that seems right.
