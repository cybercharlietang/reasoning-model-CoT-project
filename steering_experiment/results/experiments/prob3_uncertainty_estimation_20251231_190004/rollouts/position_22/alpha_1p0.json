    "text": "? Wait, no, that can't be right because the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is indeed 4, but then the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, this seems like a pattern where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for this. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, is that right? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Then, the next digit is 2 (from 29524), which is in the ten thousands place. 2*3=6, plus any carry? No carry here, so write 6. So putting it all together: 6 (from 2*3), then 8 (from 9*3 + carry), then 8 (from 5*3 + carry), then 7 (from 2*3 + carry), then 2 (from 4*3). So that would be 6 followed by 8, 8, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 should be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Then, there's no more digits, so the carryover 2 would be added to the next higher place, but since there are no more digits, it's just 2. Wait, but that would make it 28572, but that's not correct. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the digit places. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, how? Let me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit:5 *3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit:9 *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit:2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So yes, 29524 *3=88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each layer is 1 +3*previous layer. So:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think. If each layer is defined by L_n = 1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 +3*L_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 +3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 +3*A*3^{n-1} +3B =1 + A*3^n +3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B.\n\nRight side: A*3^n +3B +1.\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n +3B +1.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB =3B +1.\n\nSo, -2B =1 \u2192 B= -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^1 + B =3A + (-1/2) =4.\n\nSo, 3A -1/2=4 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the method works. Let's say, instead of nine layers, let's try two layers: 3(1+3(1+3)). Compute this step by step. Innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 3(1+3*4)=3(1+12)=3*13=39. Alternatively, using the formula: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Then, 3*L_2=39. Correct. So, the method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting from the innermost layer, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, correct.

Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524.

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each step without getting lost. It's a bit tedious, but since each layer only depends on the one before it, it's manageable. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have predicted this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_n is the value of the nth layer. If I can model this as a recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression or a formula that gives me L_n directly without computing each layer step by step. Let's try to analyze the recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => 2A = -1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's consider n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L_n for n=9, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Let's compute L_9 using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result I got by computing each layer manually. So, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula saved me time and reduced the chance of error, especially since computing each layer step by step can be quite time-consuming and prone to arithmetic mistakes. It's always nice when a pattern can be modeled with a formula. In this case, recognizing the linear recurrence allowed me to bypass the step-by-step computation, which is especially useful if the expression had more layers. But even with nine layers, it's manageable either way. I think I've got the correct answer here, but just to be thorough, let me verify the final multiplication once more: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all my computations check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Hmm, okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 120*3 = 360, and 1*3 = 3, so total is 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, and 4*3 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do a lot of steps, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I computed earlier. So, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c = 3 and d = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * C + (3^{n} - 1)/2, where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is our case, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I'm done here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer and then finding a pattern helped me solve it efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula both lead to the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, that's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, and 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, and 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error when multiplying large numbers. Let's verify each layer's computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me think. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence and find a formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. When n = 2, a_2 = 13. So, 13 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I think of it as a series, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))) with nine 3s. But since we already have a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, perhaps the series approach isn't necessary here. However, it might be useful for a different perspective. Let me consider the expression as follows: Let\u2019s denote the innermost term as S = 1 + 3. Then, moving outwards, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the next term is 1 + 3*S, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*S), and so on. But this seems similar to the recurrence approach, so maybe it's not adding much new insight. In any case, since both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach yield the same result, I'm pretty confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". Wait, no, that's too simplistic. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, actually, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, but since that's the innermost, it's just 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So maybe I can compute each layer step by step up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 at the end. Let me try to write this down step by step. Let me list each layer and compute its value:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. So the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo each layer seems correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me check the multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo writing it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure of the problem. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the number of layers is small (nine layers), computing each step is manageable. But just to explore, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me write that down. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So in general, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to derive the formula, that's a good check. It also explains why each layer's value is growing exponentially\u2014it's because each layer is multiplied by 3, leading to a geometric progression.\n\nSo, to summarize my steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression, which forms a recurrence relation.\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n3. Verify the correctness of each layer's value.\n4. Derive a general formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation.\n5. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer efficiently.\n6. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThis method ensures accuracy and efficiency, especially when dealing with similar problems in the future. It's always good to look for patterns and possible formulas when faced with repetitive structures in mathematics.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe recognize that each layer is of the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting from the innermost layer. We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ". So, the innermost part is 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Plugging in Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times the outermost layer. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait a second, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me double-check the layers because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is 1+3, which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, my computation should be correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nWait, earlier I wrote 1,093 as 1093, which is correct, but in the previous step, I wrote 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. So, that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, each layer n corresponds to L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": ". Hmm, okay, so the innermost part is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Wait, that's a big jump. Let me double-check that. 3*13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, that seems right. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, that's growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify that because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error somewhere. Let me recompute Layer 9 and the final multiplication step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 again. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So putting it all together: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. I think I did it correctly, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So both methods agree, which makes me more confident that the answer is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm ready to present the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the next layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a trend. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. So, the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Let me recompute each layer carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 121*3: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3 again: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check this multiplication once more because I might have made an error in the carry-over. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the entire calculation once more because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which propagates outward. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer's computation leads to the next, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. The expression seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence relation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nWait, that seems odd because our initial terms are all positive integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me try to unroll the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nLet's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the ninth term is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to derive it.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nWe found the homogeneous solution a_h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, and the pattern holds. Each layer follows the recurrence relation, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth one, the result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.

Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the entire Layer 9 expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's do this carefully. 3 * 29524. I can break it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Wait, but that might not be the right breakdown. Alternatively, I can compute it as 29524 * 3. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is the outermost layer 3 times Layer 9? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...)))\n\nSo, yes, the outermost operation is 3 times the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm a bit concerned because when I compute Layer 9, I get 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But I want to make sure that I didn't make an error in any of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm going to try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a formula for this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": "? Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check: 1 + 3 is indeed 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can think of another way to compute this, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify the calculation. Let me see: Each layer seems to be following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good confirmation. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, I was able to reach the final result. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to derive a formula, which confirmed the result. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with such a lengthy expression. So, yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right?

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify this multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it step by step made it manageable. I just had to remember to compute each layer one at a time, starting from the inside and moving outward. It's like peeling an onion\u2014layer by layer. Each time, I substituted the computed value of the inner layer into the next outer layer until I reached the very outermost part, which was then multiplied by 3. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12, so 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*20000 = 60000; 3*9000 = 27000; 3*500 = 1500; 3*20 = 60; 3*4 = 12. Wait, actually, that might be a bit tedious. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it properly: 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nThere's no more digits, so write down the carry over 2.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could help verify the result.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's find B first. If we assume that the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, then the particular solution would be a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I started by computing each layer step by step, which gave me 88572. Then, I recognized the pattern as a recurrence relation, solved it using the method for linear recurrences, and arrived at the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\). Each layer follows the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, this is getting a bit bigger each time. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so total is 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, that seems quite large. Let me verify my calculations because that number feels a bit big, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the digits are 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from the ten thousands place), 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,7572? That can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572. Let me compute it another way.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final result is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I can see that each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each with \"1 + 3(\", so Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, each step I took was correct, computing from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, then multiplying by 3. So, I think my calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor Layer 1 (n=1): a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches my earlier result.\n\nLayer 2 (n=2): a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3 (n=3): a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4 (n=4): a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5 (n=5): a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6 (n=6): a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7 (n=7): a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8 (n=8): a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9 (n=9): a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula without expanding each layer, I could use the formula for a_n and then multiply by 3.\n\nSince a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, I arrived at the value of the innermost expression, then built up each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost layer. Multiplying this outermost value by 3 gave the final result. Additionally, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to derive a formula, which confirmed the result. So, I think I'm solid here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": "? Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the expression, each innermost layer is 1 + 3, but the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, no, looking again, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then the next one is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. Let me correct that. So, let's define each layer properly. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost expression, and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4? Wait, no, because in the given expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, L1 is 1 + 3, but then L2 is 1 + 3*(L1), L3 is 1 + 3*(L2), etc. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost term is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, after computing L9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 *3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 *3 =27,000 \u2192 60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n500 *3=1,500 \u2192 87,000+1,500=88,500\n\n24*3=72 \u2192 88,500+72=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem starts with 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the entire nested expression, which we computed as L9=29524. So, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3)\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\n\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nBecause the original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed L1 to L9, I ended up with L9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut let me check if the original problem has 9 layers or 8 layers. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent layer is another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 8 layers, not 9, because the innermost is just (1+3), and each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...)) where ... is the previous layer\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n\n- Then, moving outward, each (1+3(...)) is another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 8 layers, because the first (1+3) is layer 1, then each subsequent is layers 2 through 9? Wait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because the expression starts with 3*(1+3*(...)), so the number of (1+3) expressions is 8, each nested inside the previous.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 8 layers of (1+3(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(A), where A is (1+3*(B)), and B is (1+3*(C)), etc., until the innermost C is (1+3). So, the number of layers is 8, because each time we go in, it's another (1+3*(...)), starting from the innermost (1+3). So, perhaps I miscounted earlier, and there are only 8 layers, not 9.\n\nWait, let me count the number of (1+3) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, the number of (1+3) expressions increases by one. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n- The first is 3*(1+3(...)), so that's one.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's two.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is (1+3). So, how many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of times (1+3 appears:\n\nLooking at the expression, each (1+3 is followed by another (1+3 until the innermost. So, the number of (1+3) is 9, but the number of layers is 8 because the innermost is just (1+3). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, regardless of how many layers there are. So, perhaps I should just proceed step by step, computing each layer as I did before, regardless of the count.\n\nWait, in my initial computation, I went up to L9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But perhaps I overcounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nLet me write the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times 1+3 is used, which is 9 times, but each time it's nested inside the previous one. So, perhaps there are 9 layers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, if I have n layers, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then layer 2: (1+3*(layer1)). So, if the expression has m layers, then the outermost layer is 3*(layer m). Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is layer1. Then each subsequent (1+3(...)) is another layer. Let's count how many (1+3) are present.\n\nEach time I see a (1+3, it's a new layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)), which would mean 9 layers. So, perhaps my initial computation was correct with L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but when I computed L9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute it another way, using a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L_9 would be:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nBecause n=9, so n+1=10.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for L9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Because in the original expression, each (1+3 is a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3) expressions, which is 9. Hence, L9 is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula I derived, without computing each layer.\n\nSince L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to see if they match my earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly, and each layer's value matches my step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or computations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Plugging in Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the multiplication by 3 at each layer seems to be handled correctly. I don't see any errors in the arithmetic or the reasoning. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking down 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Let me check that: 20000 + 9000 = 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the earlier layers where it's easy to slip up. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Let me write down the results so far: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Wait, 4, 13, 40... I wonder if there's a formula here. Let me compute the next layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me do that step by step: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check 3*29524 again to be thorough. Let me compute 29524*3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait a second, just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, we can find the steady-state solution by setting L_n = L_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. But since our particular solution is a constant, maybe that's not the right approach here. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, the expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used a recursive approach, found a formula, and even computed it using exponentials to make sure. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost layer and propagate it outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me keep going to see if I can find a pattern or maybe a formula for this. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 41*3 is 123. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step which affects all subsequent layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's check 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 123=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, it seems my calculations are correct.

    "text": " Hmm, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So 3*9841 = 29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer. It was a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer, it became manageable. Each step involved just multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's like a recursive process. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have given me the result without computing each layer, but maybe that's overcomplicating it. For now, the step-by-step approach worked fine.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": "? Wait, no, the innermost part is 1 + 3, so that's 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3: 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, and then multiplying the final result by 3, I arrive at 88572. I don't think I made any errors in my calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Wait, no, actually, L(1) is 1 + 3, which is 4, as we computed. Then, L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L(1) = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L(9). Let me compute L(9): L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's solid. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, let me compute 29524*3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3 is 88572. Wait, let me verify that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern or figure out a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. Let me verify a couple of these to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Then, once I got to the outermost layer, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. It's interesting because each layer grows exponentially, which makes sense given the multiplicative factor of 3 each time. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute a couple of the layers again. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As above, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that all adds up.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving outward, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Continuing this pattern, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer step by step, making sure to compute each multiplication and addition correctly. Then, once I reached the outermost layer, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. I think that makes sense, and I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.

    "text": ". That seems straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a second, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27. Wait, no, let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to ensure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate.\n\nLet me list out each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step wasn't too bad. I wonder if this sequence relates to a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, each term is built upon the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1. It might be a form of a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a moment. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then each term is defined recursively. So, for n from 2 to 9, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps there's a closed-form formula for it. Let me try to derive that. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r = 3 and c = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - (c)/(1 - r). Wait, let me make sure. The standard solution for a linear recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1 + c/(1 - r)) - c/(1 - r). Hmm, but in our case, r is 3, which is greater than 1, so the denominator (1 - r) is negative. Let me plug in the values. Here, a_1 = 4, r = 3, c = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n-1}*(4 + 1/(1 - 3)) - 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying inside the parentheses: 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 4 + (-1/2) = 7/2. Therefore, a_n = 3^{n-1}*(7/2) - (-1/2) = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let me write that as a_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7*3^{0} + 1)/2 = (7*1 + 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (7*3^{1} + 1)/2 = (21 + 1)/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I had a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me check my steps again. The standard solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1 + c/(1 - r)) - c/(1 - r). Wait, maybe I missed a step. Let me rederive it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r) => 4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) => 4 = 3A + (-1/2). So, 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2). Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, that matches my earlier calculation. n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct again. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, which goes up to 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier result for layer 9. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, if I were to compute this using the formula directly, without computing each layer, I could have saved some time, but since I was able to derive the formula, that's a good learning experience. In summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value step by step and then verify it using a closed-form formula. This problem was a good exercise in nested expressions and recurrence relations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n- 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The result of the computation is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": ". That seems straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 3*(1 + 3) is 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. Yep, that's correct. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, right? So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Let me keep going to see if I can spot a trend. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, then 87000 + 1500 = 88500, then 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so maybe I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break this down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.

Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. Adding those: 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the whole thing. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, that might be a bit messy. Alternatively, I can compute it directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me verify using another method. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. Started from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Calculated each layer up to Layer 9, which was 29524.\n4. Multiplied Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result, 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a couple of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121. So 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is calculated step by step until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Then, moving out one layer, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. That's 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, plus 3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. Adding those: 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe breaking it down differently. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the Layer 9 calculation. Let me double-check Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841. So, 3*9841. Let me compute that again: 9841 * 3. 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, writing it out: 9841 * 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. That seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Wait, but I feel like that number is quite large, and I'm not sure if I did all the layers correctly. Maybe I should verify each layer's calculation to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Let me go back and check each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me compute 29524 * 3 again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, yes, 88572. Wait a second, but I'm thinking that the problem is written with nine sets of (1+3(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). But when I counted, I started from Layer 1 as the innermost, which is correct. So, each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a geometric progression kind of pattern. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be seen as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, to find a_9, I can use the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplifying the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct. So, 59049 - 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems to add up. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The closed-form solution confirms that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final computation of 3 multiplied by the result of the outermost layer. The step-by-step verification ensures that each computation is accurate, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": " Hmm, okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that step by step. 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that's 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 60 is 88,560; 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

    "text": ". So, the innermost expression is 4. Then, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to multiply each digit: 29524 \u00d7 3. Starting from the right: 4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8. Finally, 9\u00d73=27, but wait, the number is 29524, so the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, from right to left: 4\u00d73=12, 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7. Next:5\u00d73=15, 5, carry 1. Next:9\u00d73=27 +1=28, 8, carry 2. Next:2\u00d73=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 \u00d7 3: 4\u00d73=12, so 2 with carryover 1. Next digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7. Next:5\u00d73=15, 5 with carryover 1. Next:9\u00d73=27 +1=28, 8 with carryover 2. Next:2\u00d73=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 times 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2:1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40, Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121, Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364, Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093, Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1.

Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3, well, 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let's see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved using a formula. The standard approach for such a recurrence is to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since the problem is to compute 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation with a closed-form formula, or manipulate the expression algebraically, I end up with the same result: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods converge to the same number, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.
