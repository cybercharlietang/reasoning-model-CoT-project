So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 3 * 29524 = (3 * 20000) + (3 * 9000) + (3 * 500) + (3 * 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, I think my calculation is correct.

    "text": ". Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so total is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. Adding those gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. Layer 6 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093. Calculating 3*1,093: 1,000*3 is 3,000, 93*3 is 279, so total is 3,279. Plus 1 is 3,280. So, Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280: 3,000*3 is 9,000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9,840. Plus 1 is 9,841. Layer 8 is 9,841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. Then, add 1 to get 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29,524. Let me calculate that: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 = 60,000, 9,000*3 = 27,000, 500*3 = 1,500, 24*3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000, plus 1,500 is 88,500, plus 72 is 88,572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake with all these multiplications. Let me double-check a couple of the layers. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. Right. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 is 88,572. That seems accurate.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to get lost with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this without computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series. Let me think about that. If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before, so that's a good consistency check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now. Just to recap, I approached the problem by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer step by step. Then, I verified my result using a formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, which gave me the same answer. It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with repetitive patterns and multiple layers of computation. So, I believe 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's compute 3*40 first: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me see if that approach would work. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0 * r^n)/(1 - r), but wait, that formula is for when the recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. Actually, the homogeneous solution and particular solution approach might be better here. Alternatively, since it's a simple recurrence, we can unroll it. Let's try to write out the first few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a_1. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_1\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*a_1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_1\nContinuing this pattern, it seems that a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + (a_1)*(3^{n-1})\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's see:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = 4\nUsing the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 + 4*(3^{0}) = (3 -1)/2 + 4*1 = 2/2 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Hmm, that doesn't match a_1=4. So maybe my formula is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Let me think again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is effectively building up a number in base 3 or something similar, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nLet me just recap the steps:\n\n1. Recognize that the expression is a nested recurrence where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost one (Layer 1) up to the outermost (Layer 9).\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, which gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n4. Plug in n=9 to find a_9, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing that it is a nested recurrence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost one and move outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\). Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 363 + 1 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems consistent. For example, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in my computations, so I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Hmm, this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 was 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, and the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer. I think I've solved it correctly. It was a bit tedious computing each layer manually, but having the formula confirmed it. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms the result. The final value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern emerging here. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right?

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let's continue to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, yes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, that's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, that's similar to a geometric series. Let me think. If I have a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from 1, then the terms would be 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, etc., which is exactly what I computed. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. At n=2, a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, the outermost Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3, starting from 1, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. But the recurrence approach worked well. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer depends on the previous one.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nWait a second, that seems like each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check: Layer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40, correct. So, maybe each layer is following the formula: Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) + 1. If that's the case, then I can compute each subsequent layer using this formula instead of manually computing each time, which would save time. Let me verify this with the next layers. Layer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121. Layer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364. Layer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1093. Layer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280. Layer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841. Layer 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me recount. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3(...) is another layer. So, from the original expression, I have: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 1+3 parts: Let's see, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the innermost: 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count them: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) and so on until the outermost. Wait, actually, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of 1+3 sections: Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the total number of layers would be equal to the number of 1+3 sections. Let's count: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) 4. (1+3(...)) 5. (1+3(...)) 6. (1+3(...)) 7. (1+3(...)) 8. (1+3(...)) 9. (1+3(...)) Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, it's Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that means I need to compute up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. So, let me list the layers again, making sure I have 9 layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, final result = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, compute 29000 * 3 = 87000.\n\nThen, 524 * 3 = 1572.\n\nSo, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time wrapping around, so how many layers is that?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...):\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, but the outermost is 3*(...), so actually, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that, so total layers would be 9, as I computed earlier.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of times 1+3 appears, starting from the innermost, it's 9 times, right? Because each time you go out a layer, you have another 1+3(...). So, 9 layers in total.\n\nYes, so Layer 9 is the outermost, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence is Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1, with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nLayer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^(n-1)) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, A = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLayer n = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nLayer 1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nLayer 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nLayer 3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nLayer 4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nLayer 5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nLayer 6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nLayer7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nLayer8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nLayer9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, Layer9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nBut either way, the result is the same: 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues for 9 layers. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer follows the formula Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9, we compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Got it, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Continuing: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next layer: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving out another layer: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the whole expression is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But let me check the multiplication again for the final step just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was built upon the previous one, and the multiplication checks out. Therefore, the final result should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, the total expression is 3 * (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. Let's compute 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, actually, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it more carefully. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Got it. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, that's a pattern. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523, then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value is indeed 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, both by iterative computation and by using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841 is... Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

Continuing to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Breaking it down, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplications. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Hmm, but wait a second, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me check another way: 29524 * 3. Let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

    "text": ". Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I'm seeing a pattern here. Each layer is taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me check if that's the case. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Finally, 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Maybe I should double-check a couple of layers. Let's go back to Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1 +3a_1, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear, so perhaps we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, with characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, if I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as a sum of 3^n terms. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's try to expand it step by step: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, if I think of it as a sum, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))))). If I denote S as the sum inside, then S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But since the structure repeats, S = 1 + 3*S. Wait, no, because S is defined as the entire expression inside, but in this case, the outermost 3 is multiplied by S, where S is 1 + 3*(...). Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Each time we have a 1, and then 3 times another 1, and so on. So, expanding the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*1))). Let me see how many terms there are. Since there are nine layers, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1 and multiplies by 3. So, the innermost is 1 +3, then next is 1 +3*(1 +3), etc. So, when fully expanded, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's try to write this as a sum. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost: 1 +3 =4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, again, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is 3^n, but I have to be careful with the coefficients. Let me try to see. If I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))))). Let me count the number of 1s. Each layer adds a 1, and there are nine layers. Wait, no, the innermost is 1 +3, which is two terms, but each subsequent layer adds another 1. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. If I have n layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... +3*(1 +3)...))). For n layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... +3*4)...)), where 4 is from the innermost layer. Wait, maybe it's easier to model it as a sum where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 to k=9, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have nine layers, the total expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as we computed earlier. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and even thinking about the geometric series approach, though that was a bit fuzzy. But the step-by-step and the recurrence both led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Continuing this pattern, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let me compute 3*40 first: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3, so 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Moving to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 * 3. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me list out the layers as I compute them:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\n...\n\nWait, that seems like each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me check:\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364\nLayer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1093\nLayer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\nLayer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\nLayer 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is exactly the same as 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, yes, each time, it's multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, if I keep applying this, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer clearly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me do that step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572? Let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct)\n\nOkay, so each layer is correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88,572. But wait a minute, that seems like a very large number. Let me make sure that the original expression is indeed nine layers deep. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first 3(...), each opening parenthesis is followed by a 1 + 3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nFrom the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of 1+3(...) expressions, starting from the innermost, each time it's one more layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3(Layer8). So, yes, nine layers. Therefore, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Since the expression is 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3, so it's (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*(29524)=88,572. But using the formula, it's (3^{11} -3)/2=88,572. So both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step without using the formula, just to verify each layer again.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, every step checks out. Therefore, I can be certain that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me think again. 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, and 3*24 = 72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, plus 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, starting with 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which might have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also gives us the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, the outermost 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, all the steps check out. I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. The expression can be represented as a recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the layers go up to a_9, and the final result is 3*a_9. Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on, up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. Alternatively, the recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can find A and B. Let me try that. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. So, a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me check Layer 4 to see if this pattern continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Okay, Layer 5 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Wait a minute, the numbers are getting big quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that. 3*9841: Well, 9841*3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Let me verify a couple of the layers again. For example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3 again to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem from a different angle, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might be similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_n represents the value of the nth layer. Then, from the problem, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution and particular solution approach. The recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps thoroughly, checking each computation and even deriving a general formula to confirm the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\), we compute each layer up to \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Finally, multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression isn't just Layer 9. It's 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer. So, the final computation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a jump. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, that's another big jump. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, these numbers are getting big quickly. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Well, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me just compute it directly: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me avoid computing each layer step by step. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, for each layer, the value is 1 plus three times the previous layer's value. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - (B/(1 - r))) * r^{n-1} + B/(1 - r), where r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case, and B is the constant term added each time, which is 1. Let me plug in the values. First, let's compute B/(1 - r). Since B=1 and r=3, that would be 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Then, a_n = (a_1 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). Simplifying, a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 -1/2 = 81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561: 6561*9. 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. Adding them up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 +9=59049. So, (9/2)*6561 =59049/2=29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 -0.5=29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to see if it still holds. For example, n=4: a_4=(9/2)*3^3 -1/2=(9/2)*27 -1/2=243/2 -1/2=242/2=121. Correct. Similarly, n=5: (9/2)*81 -1/2=729/2 -1/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula is consistent. Therefore, using the formula for n=9 gives us a_9=29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid.

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524*3: Let's compute step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Alternatively, let's compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a minute, that seems quite large. Let me verify if I did each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and check each step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x, applied multiple times. Specifically, starting from x\u2080 = 1, then x\u2081 = 1 + 3x\u2080, x\u2082 = 1 + 3x\u2081, and so on, up to x\u2088, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, so x\u2080 = 4, then x\u2081 = 1 + 3x\u2080, up to x\u2088. Then, the entire expression is 3x\u2088. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define x\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, x\u2081 = 1 + 3x\u2080 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. x\u2082 = 1 + 3x\u2081 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. x\u2083 = 1 + 3x\u2082 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. x\u2084 = 1 + 3x\u2083 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. x\u2085 = 1 + 3x\u2084 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. x\u2086 = 1 + 3x\u2085 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. x\u2087 = 1 + 3x\u2086 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. x\u2088 = 1 + 3x\u2087 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3x\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for x\u2099, where x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, with x\u2080 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081. The homogeneous solution is x\u2099^(h) = C*3\u207f. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume x\u2099^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition x\u2080 = 4. When n=0, x\u2080 = C*3\u2070 - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 4 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the solution is x\u2099 = (9/2)*3\u207f - 1/2. Simplifying, x\u2099 = (9*3\u207f - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=0: x\u2080 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (9*27 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (9*81 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (9*243 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (9*729 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (9*2187 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (9*6561 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, x\u2088 = (9*3\u2078 -1)/2. Let's compute 3\u2078. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, x\u2088 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*x\u2088 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, let's see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*x\u2088, where x\u2088 =29524. So, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, is there a way to express the entire expression in a single formula without computing each layer? Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(x\u2088), where x\u2088 is as above. But I think the step-by-step approach is sufficient here, especially since the number of layers isn't too large. However, if there were more layers, the formula would be more efficient. But in this case, nine layers aren't too bad to compute manually. Alternatively, I can also think of this as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1, which complicates things. Let me explore that idea. Suppose I let S = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. Then, S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next layer. But since each layer is similar, S' = 1 + 3*S''. This seems recursive, which brings me back to the recurrence relation approach. So, perhaps the recurrence is the best way to go here. Alternatively, I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand it.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 +1) =1 + 9 +3=13= 3\u00b2 +3 +1\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(Layer 2)=1 +3*(3\u00b2 +3 +1)=1 +3\u00b3 +3\u00b2 +3=1 +27 +9 +3=40=3\u00b3 +3\u00b2 +3 +1\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*(Layer 3)=1 +3*(3\u00b3 +3\u00b2 +3 +1)=1 +3\u2074 +3\u00b3 +3\u00b2 +3=1 +81 +27 +9 +3=121=3\u2074 +3\u00b3 +3\u00b2 +3 +1\n\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be the sum of powers of 3 up to 3\u207f, where n is the layer number. Let's check:\n\nLayer 1: 3\u00b9 +1=3 +1=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:3\u00b2 +3 +1=9 +3 +1=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:3\u00b3 +3\u00b2 +3 +1=27 +9 +3 +1=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:3\u2074 +3\u00b3 +3\u00b2 +3 +1=81 +27 +9 +3 +1=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, in general, Layer k: sum_{i=0}^{k} 3^i = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Wait, that's the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum of 3\u2070 +3\u00b9 +3\u00b2 +...+3^k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with Layer 1: k=1, sum= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: (3\u00b3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: (3\u2074 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: (3\u2075 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, Layer k is equal to (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, by recognizing the sum of the geometric series at each layer. This might be more efficient, especially for a larger number of layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. So, to summarize my thought process: I first tried computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, I then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Then, I realized that each layer is the sum of a geometric series, which allowed me to use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to compute each layer directly, leading to the same result. Both methods confirmed that the final answer is 88572. I think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both approaches led to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric series pattern. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that each layer can be expressed as (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, where k is the layer number. Applying this formula to the outermost layer and multiplying by 3, we arrive at the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify using another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursively defined sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, maybe we can find a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we get the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, each layer adds another 3*(previous result). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, expanding it all the way, the expression inside is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since it's nested, it's a bit more complex. However, using the formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is a neat way to compute it without expanding each layer. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution to efficiently compute the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This forms a linear recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value at the nth layer. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: Since there are nine layers, substitute \\( n = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Plugging in Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here, but let's keep going to see if it's consistent. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, wait a second. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me break that down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572.

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going to see if it's consistent. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 0*3=0, write down 0. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have messed up the steps. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. So, the final answer should be 88572. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's denote the nth term as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is Layer 1, which is 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c -1). Wait, let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + m, the solution is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + m*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1). In this case, k is 3, m is 1, and a_0 would be a_1 =4. Wait, actually, our indexing starts at a_1, so maybe I need to adjust. Alternatively, let's index starting from a_0. Let me redefine: Let a_0 = 4 (which is Layer 1). Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 =1 + 3*4=13, which is Layer 2. a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 3*13=40, which is Layer 3. So, in general, a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0=4. So, the number of layers is 9, so the outermost layer is a_8, since we start counting from 0. So, a_8 would be the value of Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8. So, using the formula for the linear recurrence: a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + m*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1). Here, k=3, m=1, a_0=4, n=8. So, a_8 = 3^8 *4 + 1*(3^8 -1)/(3 -1). Let's compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, a_8 = 6561*4 + (6561 -1)/2. Let's compute each part: 6561*4: 6000*4=24000, 500*4=2000, 61*4=244. So, 24000 + 2000=26000, +244=26244. Next, (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. So, a_8=26244 + 3280=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also gives me 88572. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and even found an alternative method to verify the result. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the answer makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the total expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is the structure of the expression. This seems like it's following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's nested, each step depends on the previous result. It's interesting how quickly the numbers grow. Starting from 4, each subsequent layer triples the previous result and adds 1, leading to exponential growth. So, after nine layers, the number is already in the tens of thousands.

Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is next: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is the outermost one: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times this Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify each step because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a calculation error somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That's similar to a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. If I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that might make computing it easier, especially for multiple layers. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, equation 1: 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find another equation. For n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, equation 2: 9A + B = 13. Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. So, A = 1.5. Then, from equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. I know that 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243. Hmm, 200*200=40,000, but that's not helpful. Let's compute it step by step. 243 * 243: Break it down as (200 + 40 + 3)*(200 + 40 + 3). But that's complicated. Alternatively, I can compute 243*200 = 48,600; 243*40 = 9,720; and 243*3 = 729. Adding those together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; plus 729 is 59,049. So, 3^10 = 59,049. Therefore, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Wait, that's 29,524, but earlier I had 29,524 as Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; +1,500 = 88,500; +60 = 88,560; +12 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59,049, so 3^11 is 59,049*3 = 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until we reach the outermost layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the total value is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Wait, but let me check the multiplication for Layer 9 again: 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 29524 * 3: Let me compute this another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.

Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.

Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Wait, no, 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3.

So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each layer again to ensure accuracy. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers, so it's likely correct. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to the next, and so on, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. As we saw, each L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But for nine layers, either method works. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recursive approach, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
