Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I considered that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\).

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to multiply out the entire expression, every term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. And for the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0\\), which is exactly what I did. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.

So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
