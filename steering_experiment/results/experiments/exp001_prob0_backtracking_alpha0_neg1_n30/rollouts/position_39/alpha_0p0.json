So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from 6 * 20, which is 120. That seems correct. I think I'm confident that 120 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I needed the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it another way. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion multiplies each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore all terms from the second expansion that have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) because those would add to the exponent of \\(c\\), making the term have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
