    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me find the coefficient for that term. \n\nLooking at the general term, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they're separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because when you multiply by something else, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term isn't affected by the \\(c\\) part. \n\nWait, let me make sure. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) doesn't get combined with any terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would produce terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would still just be 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\) and are separate. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm confusing the problem. Let me re-read it. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\); it just means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion. However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) expansion has terms with different exponents, and the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't change the coefficient; it just means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems too high. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on the \\(c\\) terms; it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, meaning that in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which implies a numerical value. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. So, if I think about it, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Or maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something. But as it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1, right? Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1)^2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would still be 1 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1)^2\\), which is 4. So, the coefficient would be 1 * 4 = 4. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 4. \n\nWait, so in that example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in my example, I considered the sum of coefficients, which is when \\(c = 1\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, the coefficients are multiplied. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as in the first part. \n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me check another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a bad example. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero because the variables are separate. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I considered the sum of coefficients, I thought the coefficient would be 4, but actually, it's zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning was wrong. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but its coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's not possible because the coefficient itself is a polynomial. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that it's considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nSo, let's compute that. First, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term; it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. If the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's likely that it's considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. Therefore, the coefficient would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), perhaps \\(c^0\\), which would make the coefficient a number. \n\nSince the problem didn't specify, I'm going to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because it's not a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the answer the problem is looking for. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we consider the term where the exponents"

    "text": " \n\nSo, looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), if I apply the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me calculate that term. \n\nThe binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^{2}b^{2}\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a minute, so I think I might have misunderstood the problem. It's not just \\((a + b)^4\\), but that multiplied by another binomial expression in \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider both expansions and see how they interact. \n\nLet me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might actually need to consider the entire product. But wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, in the product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) (for various \\(k\\)) would be 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because if we consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to have the same exponent for \\(c\\) as in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nLet me check the problem again: it says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6*1, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have 6*6, and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're considering all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), and adding them up. \n\nBut wait, that would be the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you expand the product, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term in one part and any term in the other, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the other part. \n\nWait, but let me verify with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) plus the coefficient of \\(a^2/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. But the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\) is 2, so 1*2=2, which matches. \n\nSo, in that case, the method works. Therefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression should be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is canceled out. That would be a different approach. Let me check that possibility. \n\nIf the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. \n\nThe general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, I'm a bit confused. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look back at the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from \\(a c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a/c\\)), so total 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 (from \\(b c\\)) plus 1 (from \\(b/c\\)), so total 2. \n\nNow, according to the earlier method, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, so 1*2=2, which matches. Similarly for \\(b\\). \n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6*20=120. But since it didn't specify, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Another way to look at it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all terms in the other part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire polynomial, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nSo, yes, 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when problems involve multiple variables, they might expect you to consider terms where all variables are specified, but in this case, only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are mentioned. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's spread across different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me calculate it another way. Let's expand both parts and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the terms are:\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6"

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me set up the binomial coefficients for that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2}\\), which simplifies to \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product will be a product of terms from each expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in other words, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, and then multiply them together, I need to find the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would include terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., depending on how the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part expands. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, they might be considering only that term, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either because typically, coefficients are constants with respect to all variables. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems a bit strange. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. But I'm getting confused here. Let me try to break it down differently. \n\nLet me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by coefficients. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(1/c^2\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. \n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so multiplying them gives 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has coefficients that sum up to 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be that coefficient multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's 6 * Q(c), which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, coefficients are constants, not expressions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but as written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\text{coefficient from first part} \\times \\text{coefficient from second part} \\times a^k b^m c^n\\). \n\nSince we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem might be implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, let's proceed under that assumption. \n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but now I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. \n\nLet me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is probably not what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but no, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for. It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the more likely scenario is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without specifying \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64,"

Let me calculate those coefficients. \n\nThe coefficients are:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, I can't just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) alone because I also have to consider the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so maybe I need to think about how these two parts interact. Let me write down both expansions separately and then see how they multiply together. \n\nFirst, as I did before, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions. So, I need to multiply \\((a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4)\\) by \\((c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the corresponding terms in each expansion. However, since the second expansion only has powers of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain as they are, and the \\(c\\) terms will multiply them.\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20.\n\nWait, let me think again. The second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the only term that will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20. So, that would give \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but hold on. Is that the only term? Because in the first expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 20, etc. So, the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when multiplied by 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut let me verify that. Let's consider the entire product. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) (from the first expansion) by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\), unless you multiply by a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20, the resulting term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any other term in the first expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term in the second expansion? For example, could \\(a^4\\) multiplied by some term in the second expansion result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(a^4\\) multiplied by any term would still have \\(a^4\\), unless you have some negative exponents, but the second expansion only has positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Similarly, the term \\(4a^3b\\) when multiplied by something would give \\(a^3b\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is the only one that can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term in the second expansion, specifically the constant term 20.\n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the coefficient from the second expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. But in this case, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and note that the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, when we multiply these two, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all present. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, but it would have some power of \\(c\\) attached to it unless multiplied by the constant term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) would only come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider other terms. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that suggests that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, i.e., multiplied by the constant term.\n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is correct: the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then identify the relevant terms.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe expansion is:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe expansion is:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\nThe constant term (term with \\(c^0\\)) in this expansion is 20.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so focusing on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, then in the product, it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that might not be quite right. Let me think again. When I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a number. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nActually, I think I need to consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the cross terms won't affect each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems confusing because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expansions, you might have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different values of \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But no, that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but without any \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term will be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's looking for the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, which isn't possible because all the terms will have some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me assume that's the case. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so to find this, we can consider the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me calculate that term. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Calculating that, \\(4! = 24\\), and \\(2! = 2\\), so it's \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which will have multiple terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part will just contribute a constant factor?\n\nLet me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient will be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply a term by a constant, it just scales the entire expression. So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then I can multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nNow, let's compute the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). That's equal to \\(6! / (3!3!)\\). Calculating that, \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so it's \\(720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nPutting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI was a bit confused at first about how the second part affects the coefficient, but realizing that since we're only looking for the term without \\(c\\), the second part's constant term is the only part that matters. So, the rest of the terms in the expansion of the second part would involve positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, after breaking it down and verifying each step, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems strange because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which might not be what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, but that seems too simplistic because the second part is also being multiplied. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the answer would be a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the term. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems like the answer is a polynomial, which might not be what the problem is expecting. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the term. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times each term in the expansion, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems like the answer is a polynomial, which might not be what the problem is expecting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the term.

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 \\times 64 = 384. \n\nBut is that the correct approach? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the term.

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial. However, that seems unlikely because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's break it down. The expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients in the second part won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe I should just focus on expanding the first part and then see how it interacts with the second part.\n\nLet me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, expanding that, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that entire product. \n\nHmm, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables would multiply as well. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would multiply by a term from the second part, which could involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so it's possible that \\(c\\) terms might influence the coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then I need to consider all the possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-(6 - k)}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so the sum is \\((1 + 1)^n = 2^n\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms involving \\(c\\). But that's not standard because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\), you're considering all possible exponents of other variables, so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me take a simpler example to test this idea. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, if I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), resulting in \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) will give \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) will give \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire product is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 (from \\(2ab c\\)) + 2 (from \\(2ab/c\\)) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nBut wait, in this case, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 2 (since \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\)), and the coefficients in the first expansion are 1, 2, 1. So, when I multiply, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) in the product are 1*2, 2*2, and 1*2, respectively. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have variables involved, you might have to consider specific exponents, but in this case, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), then it's just the product of the coefficients as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product as a single expansion. But I think the approach I took is correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since the second part's expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just scaling the entire first expansion by the sum of its coefficients. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that some terms from the second expansion could combine with terms from the first to produce \\(a^2b^2\\) with different exponents of \\(c\\)? No, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) would just tag along with \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient itself would still be the product of the coefficients.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just check my calculations again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as calculated using the binomial coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 is 384. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together? I think so. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, so maybe their coefficients won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nLet me confirm that thought. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients in the first part don't get multiplied by terms from the second part that involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe we can treat the two parts separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that would be a huge number. That can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way a term can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any \\(c^n\\) or \\(c^{-n}\\), the term will have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense! So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems right because when you multiply the two expansions, only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved.\n\nOkay, so let me break this down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n### Part 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\n### Part 2: Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\n### Final Coefficient\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me find which \\(k\\) gives me that. \n\nIf \\(a\\) is raised to the power of \\(4 - k\\) and \\(b\\) is raised to the power of \\(k\\), then I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), their coefficients are independent. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're considering the entire expansion, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct either.\n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, and the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but without any specific term in \\(c\\). So, if I expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, perhaps I should consider the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me check that. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But now I'm thinking that perhaps it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nI need to clarify what the problem is asking. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're considering all terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. In that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, they're considering the term in the product, so each variable's exponents are specified.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but without any specific exponent. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean setting \\(c = 1\\) in the second part, so the sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's looking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because it's a specific term.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nAs established earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the more likely interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't standard.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which would be 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. If I consider the entire expression as a product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not a standard way to look at it. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to specify all the exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a context where \\(c\\) is treated as a constant, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables. So, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Let me compute those coefficients. The coefficients are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 respectively. So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. I think the key here is that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would get multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since the second part is independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that seems odd because the second expression isn't a constant, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so that doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is 6, and then perhaps considering the entire expression, but that seems inconsistent. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. Because the second part is a separate expression, so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since the second expression is a sum, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because that would make sense as a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying by all terms in the second expression, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would still result in a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a single number. Let me assume that for now. \n\nSo, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I can approach this by considering the product of the two expansions. So, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. \n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but that seems inconsistent with the problem statement. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part is a separate expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignore the second part. But that seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me recall the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait a second, but the original expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by all the terms in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in the first part, but scaled by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me correct that. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, I think I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). That is, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. But actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's as if we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in the expanded form, there will be multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\) attached to it. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is a sum of terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear? It appears multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is contributing its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the contributions from the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me verify that. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBut wait, let me check. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches the sum of the binomial coefficients. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), but maybe it's considering the entire term, meaning that \\(c\\) could be any power. But no, in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct that we need to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, I think my initial approach was correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\)\n\nWhich expands to:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\)\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion is only in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe this isn't the best example. \n\nAlternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Here, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). But if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nBut in the original problem, the coefficient is a number because it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in my small example, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of terms. But in the original problem, since the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering all the powers of \\(c\\) together. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nLet me check this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute this. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Then, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\)\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\)\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c^2 + 4 + 2/c^2\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). \n\nIf I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion is in \\(c\\). So, maybe my initial approach is correct, but in the original problem, the exponents are such that \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. \n\nWait, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\).

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if I need to expand this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means the terms involving \\(c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but wait, actually, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would affect the overall expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't seem right because that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) come from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, the coefficient would still depend on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, but only for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, when the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, let me approach it this way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, and we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), applying the binomial theorem would give me terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, that part is straightforward. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just multiply along, but they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part just contributes a factor that's the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, that's not exactly correct. The sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q(c)\\) gives \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's break it down more carefully. \n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). As I found before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the product would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, so that's fixed. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything because we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because actually, when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other variable. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, yeah, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and check the sum of its coefficients. \n\nThe expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}\\), ..., \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}\\), which are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, the sum is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any constraints. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that there are terms in the second expansion that affect this. But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by any term in the second expansion, which is in \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion? \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the multiplication affects it. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not present in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any other variables. So, perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that's just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply by the second part, you might get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the total exponent of \\(c\\) might be zero if you take certain terms. Hmm, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so it's just the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems contradictory because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to multiple terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, no, because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I'm considering all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the product, so considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is presented as a single term, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which would be terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too big. Let me check: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but the problem didn't specify that. It just said \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the structure of the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term of the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, that's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the first expansion multiplied by anything else to get \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, in this case, the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(b^2 c\\), and similarly for \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in this product because the first expansion only has up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you don't get \\(b^2\\) times anything to get \\(b^2\\) again. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. \n\nWait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought that the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. But in this example, that would give 1 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which doesn't exist, so actually zero) times 2, which is zero, which matches. So, maybe my reasoning is correct. \n\nWait, but in my problem, the first part does have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part has sum of coefficients 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to compute the product more explicitly. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\): \n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. \n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement"

Calculating those coefficients, we have \\(1, 4, 6, 4, 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. So, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nLet me write out the terms for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When \\(k=0\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\). For \\(k=1\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\). For \\(k=2\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\). For \\(k=3\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). For \\(k=4\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\). For \\(k=5\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\). And for \\(k=6\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\). So, putting it all together, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to multiply these two polynomials together. But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to compute the entire product. Let me think about that.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply it by each term in the second polynomial. However, when I multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will affect the overall term. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply the polynomials, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are determined by the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can actually ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just focus on how much \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply, each term will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you collect like terms, all the coefficients from the second polynomial will add up to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), then when I distribute, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Now, in the entire product, these are all separate terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent would just be 120, because that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, and when you collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients are 6 times the coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all those contributions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me verify that. Because in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second polynomial, each term has a coefficient, and when you multiply, you're effectively adding all those contributions. So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as two separate generating functions. The first one, \\((a + b)^4\\), generates terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second one, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), generates terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a polynomial in three variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can treat the second polynomial as a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBut let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial again to be sure. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, they would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, hold on. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you collect all the terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Instead, it's 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all those contributions. \n\nWait, but that's essentially the same as saying 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), and since we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, it's equivalent to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTo confirm, let's compute the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. As we did before, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it differently, suppose I consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^{\\text{something}}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial) = \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach. Suppose I consider the problem as two separate generating functions. The first generating function is for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is for \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first generating function and the sum of all coefficients in the second generating function. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, so to get the total coefficient, you have to sum over all those contributions.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then I would set \\(c = 1\\), giving me \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^"

I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to find the coefficient when \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since this term is multiplied by another binomial expression, I might have to consider how that affects the coefficient. \n\nLet me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut here's the thing: I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second binomial, I might get terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term. \n\nWait, no, actually, maybe not. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. But that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term will have additional factors involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the overall coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWe found earlier that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20. \n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Let me consider the entire expansion. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but perhaps it's in the entire expression, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. \n\nWait, no, I think I was right earlier. The problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). If I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 2\\), so the coefficient is 2 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1 for \\(a^2b^2\\), so 2. But wait, that's not quite the same because in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in \\((a + b)^2\\). Wait, maybe that's a bad example. \n\nAlternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^3\\), which has a term \\(3a^2b\\). If I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^3\\), which has a term \\(3c^0 = 3\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b c^0\\) would be \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents add up to the desired term. \n\nSo, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which means solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). This gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will only come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms from the second part. \n\nTherefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I can ignore the second part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. So, actually, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the product terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, as long as the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are squared? Or is it possible that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we need to find the total coefficient of all such terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think it's the former: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it might be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but I think the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we can treat \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately from \\(c\\), and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. \n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that gives \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term we want. \n\nBut since each such term is multiplied by a term from the other expansion, which involves \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem quite right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is the total number of terms. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but maybe it's considering the entire expression, so it's actually the product of the two coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That's straightforward: it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. \n\nTherefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense too, because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a sum over all those terms. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would require finding the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power in the second expansion. \n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), as I found earlier. So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nHmm, so now I'm confused because I have two different answers depending on whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTo resolve this, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), because otherwise, it would have specified that it's looking for the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. \n\nBut let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each with their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be... wait, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because it's not present. \n\nWait, but in our problem, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let's compute that. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). \n\nIf we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first expansion, the highest degree is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second expansion, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. So, perhaps in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c"

Looking at the terms, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here because I have another part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI think the next step is to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well using the binomial theorem.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so looking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this part first. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). But I specifically need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, let me compute that coefficient.\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Okay, so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part don't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply the two expressions together, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, so when I multiply, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which is the same as 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, I'll get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. \n\nWait, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to compute both coefficients and multiply them together.\n\nI already found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). Let me compute that coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. So, multiplying 6 \u00d7 20 gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering generating functions or multinomial coefficients? Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps using the multinomial theorem on the entire expression, but that might complicate things more. I think the approach I took is correct because I separated the two parts, found the relevant coefficients, and multiplied them together. \n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that makes sense.

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, maybe the term involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. \n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate polynomial. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a single expression, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that also doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second expansion are not constants but involve powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a single expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be the constant term, which is the middle term when expanded.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of setting \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which gave me 64, but that approach seems incorrect because the problem is likely asking for the specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: correct, and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expand using binomial theorem: correct, and found the term where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving coefficient 20.\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). That means that when I multiply them, the coefficients for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of the terms are multiplied by each other. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different, meaning that when you multiply them, the terms won't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by it, you'll have terms involving \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that this term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) cancels out, resulting in \\(c^0\\).\n\nOkay, so let's approach it that way. So, first, as before, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion has the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We set this equal to zero to find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(c^0\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\times (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us 6a^2b^2, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded, the term with c^0 is when k=3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, we get 120a^2b^2c^0. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute it again:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\times 3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Let me think again.\n\nIf the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I was correct the first time that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient is usually a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term.\n\nBut in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can come from any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is a bit ambiguous. If they want the coefficient as a polynomial, then it's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for a coefficient, they mean a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then considering that when multiplied by the second part, which is a separate variable, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and treating \\(c\\) as a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that still doesn't give a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, and the rest of the expression is just a multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. But that seems inconsistent with the way the problem is phrased.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check my initial approach. I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, I think the problem is actually expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about it again. If I have two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply them, the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be a polynomial. However, if they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be a specific term, which is 120.\n\nGiven the problem statement, I think the intended answer is 120, as that's the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\). So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), giving different terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't have a term with \\(c^0\\), which would be necessary for \\(a^2b^2\\) to stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if I expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you set \\(c = 1\\), it becomes 2^6 = 64, which is correct. But does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Or is there another way to think about it? Maybe I'm confusing the way the coefficients interact.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply 6 by each of these terms, you get 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(36c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so if the second expansion has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\)) would only be the term where \\(k=0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the only term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, and just multiplied 6 by the entire expansion, I would get terms with \\(c\\) in them, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it as \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\).

So, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to consider the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), as well. \n\nHmm, how does that work? I think when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nActually, no, because the entire product is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term in the other expansion, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, no, actually, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the terms from both expansions. So, perhaps I need to find all the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, and then sum their coefficients. But actually, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find all the possible coefficients that come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but actually, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first binomial and a term from the second binomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. \n\nBut I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a number, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean that the coefficient isn't just a single number, it's a sum over all possible \\(k\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems too complicated, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical answer. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back. \n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the product, each term is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of coefficients is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied entirely, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first polynomial, when multiplied by a term from the second polynomial, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nNo, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by any term from the second polynomial, you'll still have \\(a^3b\\) times some power of \\(c\\), which can't reduce the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. \n\nThe first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nThe second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the terms are: \n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes: \n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all these coefficients. \n\nSo, let's add them up: \n\n- 6 (from \\(c^6\\))\n- 36 (from \\(c^4\\))\n- 90 (from \\(c^2\\))\n- 120 (from \\(c^0\\))\n- 90 (from \\(c^{-2}\\))\n- 36 (from \\(c^{-4}\\))\n- 6 (from \\(c^{-6}\\))\n\nAdding these together: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. \n\nSo, the total coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, that matches what I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding, let me add them again: \n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could have realized that the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Then, multiplying that by 6 gives 384, which is the same result. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider both expansions? But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think about that.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) just contributes a constant factor. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them, the terms from each expansion combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, because it's multiplied by all those terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I need to consider the entire expression and see if there are any terms that, when multiplied together, result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the entire expression can be written as the product of two separate expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too large. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. Since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients of each term in one polynomial are multiplied by the coefficients of each term in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, let me compute that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the expression is just a scalar multiple. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and then the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me denote the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those in \\(c\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. So, maybe we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. \n\nOkay, so how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. \n\nWait, but the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\) and sum up the coefficients? That would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But earlier, I thought that might be the case. \n\nBut now I'm confused because the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the expression is a product, so each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one set of variables is independent of the other variables. So, for example, in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + d)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). So, maybe in this problem, it's the same. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, that seems contradictory because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but a polynomial in c. \n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, meaning that c can be any power, but we're only interested in the part that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. In that case, as I calculated earlier, it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about c, so maybe it's expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just a separate factor. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. \n\nI'm going to check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c. So, it's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, in this case, the coefficient of a specific term is a polynomial. \n\nBut the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in c. However, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when c = 1, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. The problem is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about c, I think the intended answer is 6, because the other part is just a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients do get multiplied. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say, (a + b) and (c + d), then the coefficient of a in the product is (c + d), and the coefficient of b is also (c + d). So, in that case, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the entire other polynomial. So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which contradicts the idea that a coefficient is a number. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have us consider only the terms where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., the constant term, so that the coefficient is a number. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the other terms. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do multiply. \n\nI think the most plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in c. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, after considering both possibilities, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need to consider the constant term"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it as \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me calculate the coefficients here. \n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the first term is \\(1 \\cdot a^4\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the second term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the third term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the fourth term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the last term is \\(1 \\cdot b^4\\).\n\nOkay, so in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait a second, so I need to multiply this expansion by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider cross terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by other terms?\n\nWait, let me think. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the terms in the first polynomial don't interact with the terms in the second polynomial in a way that would change the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nThat means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term from it would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 from the second polynomial. But \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless we consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second polynomial, I need that term to be 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) so that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this expansion. The binomial theorem tells me that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term. Let's compute that term:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nWait, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, right? Let me confirm: 6 choose 3 is 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found:\n\n6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider the entire expression:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6})\\).\n\nWait, actually, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term, which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, resulting in 120a^2b^2. All other terms would involve powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so that confirms it. The coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about it another way. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, the exponents in each variable don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Each of these terms has a coefficient from the binomial coefficients. The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, it's just multiplied by 1 (since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\)), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in the second expansion). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term.

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. \n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the part where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me think about that. \n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me calculate that coefficient. \n\nThe binomial coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I just found, 6, will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or am I misunderstanding something here?\n\nWait, no, I think I need to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, and then that term is multiplied by the entire second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Hmm, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables. But that might not make sense because \\(c\\) is a different variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might be possible. Let me think about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so maybe that's a way to compute it.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated than the problem is presenting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is a number.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to parse the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering the product, so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expansion. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let's tackle the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\), making the answer 120.\n\nLet me confirm that approach. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) which implies \\(k = 2\\), and \\(b^k = b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the combined coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but does the problem specify that we're looking for the term with \\(c^0\\)? Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is considering all terms, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would make the coefficient 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it should have included \\(c^0\\) in the term it's asking about.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the rest can be any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and doesn't care about the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial, so the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems more complicated than the problem is suggesting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, so the answer would be \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), but that seems too involved.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But that seems more likely because the problem is about expanding the product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting that answer, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are considered, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems different from what I found earlier.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. But if I consider the sum of all coefficients, that would be \\(c = 1"

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I'm looking for the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Let me write that down. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), that gives \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but actually, no, that's not quite right. \n\nHold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their expansion doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be anything because they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nSo, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense either because the sum of all coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\). \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times something, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, no, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. If I have two expressions, say \\(A = a + b\\) and \\(B = c + 1/c\\), then \\((A)^4 \\times (B)^6\\) would have terms like \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^3b \\times c^5\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every possible term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1, so substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the coefficients. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is some number, but since we're multiplying, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. \n\nWait, no, because in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other part. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead think about the product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial; it has to be a constant. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not what is being asked. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, that seems more accurate. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as we calculated earlier. \n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else, but as it is, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nSo, to confirm, let's think about it: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), or it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. \n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the more reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. \n\nTherefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this case, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by another binomial expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to handle each part separately and then combine them? Let me think.\n\nSo, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is specifically in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is just a number, so when multiplied by the other expansion, it would just be a coefficient multiplied by the entire expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the other part can be considered as a separate coefficient?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second expansion won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem correct because the coefficient is a single number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a specific term, and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the coefficient as being multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the sum would be a number, but we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be the value when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that's the sum of the coefficients, but in reality, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. \n\nWait, so let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the other polynomial. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the product of the two coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, that's not quite accurate. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, if the first coefficient is 6 and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nLet me double-check that. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by every term in Q. Therefore, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient from P is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if this approach is correct. Let's say we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nExpanding the product: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The term with \\(a^2\\) is \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 1 * 2 = 2, because the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because the coefficient is not a constant but a polynomial. But in the original problem, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would indeed involve \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire expression would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the coefficient is not just a constant but a polynomial. \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions involving variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented in a way that suggests a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That is, the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me explore this idea. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not standard; usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in the context of treating other variables as constants. \n\nWait, maybe I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I initially thought. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the entire polynomial as the coefficient. \n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a single answer, likely a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^"
