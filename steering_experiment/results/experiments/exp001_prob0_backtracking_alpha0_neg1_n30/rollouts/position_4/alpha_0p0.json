    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. Specifically, the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, let's calculate that coefficient. \n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that would mean we're interested in the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because any non-zero power of \\(c\\) would make the term have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. \n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two coefficients multiply when we consider the product of the two expansions, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nIs there any other part I might have missed? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any terms involving \\(c\\) would not contribute to that coefficient. So, indeed, only the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion affects it. Therefore, I think my reasoning is solid.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, that would be when \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider the terms from this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but there are also \\(c\\) terms involved. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial will multiply each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) will come from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, so they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expanded expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what's the coefficient, irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which can't be right. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficient should be a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find this, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(720/(6 \\times 6) = 720/36 = 20\\). Hmm, but I think I remember that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when I multiply these together, I get 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would actually mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that would give me a different result. Wait, no, because if I'm considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is not a single number. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies a specific term, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I was correct the first time, that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is present, making it \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the terms interact. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that would give me 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients as \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384, which seems high.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120?\n\nHmm, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^{2k}\\) in the second part). Wait, no, that's not correct because the exponents of \\(c\\) are independent.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not typical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, to be thorough, let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient is. But that would be time-consuming, but perhaps I can outline it.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1 + \\dfrac{6}{c} + \\dfrac{15}{c^2} + \\dfrac{20}{c^3} + \\dfrac{15}{c^4} + \\dfrac{6}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict my earlier conclusion. So, which is correct? If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in polynomial terms, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually considering all possible exponents for the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6c^6 + 6 \\times 6c^5 + 6 \\times 15c^4 + \\ldots + 6 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the intended interpretation because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. So, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6"

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\) first. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original problem has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, do I need to consider that as well? Hmm, I think so. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms that involve \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other factors would contribute to terms with \\(c\\), which we don't care about here. \n\nWait, let me make sure. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expression that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 when considering the constant term. Since these are being multiplied together, the overall coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, that would be 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, leading to 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I've missed anything here. The key was realizing that since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I only need to consider the parts of each expansion that contribute to that term. So, in the first expansion, it's straightforward, and in the second, I need the constant term because that's the only way the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nJust to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2.

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part of the expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the question is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is a product of two independent expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of that specific term, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, actually, that might not be the case. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the terms. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is a separate expansion, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if we're just considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a very large expression, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. It probably wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me adjust my approach. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so to get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, and then multiply them together.\n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this expansion. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product, I multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion. When you multiply them together, the term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have needed to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. We found those coefficients to be 6 and 20, respectively, so their product is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120, which seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. Therefore, the coefficients multiply when considering the product of specific terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part combine to give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n   - We are looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) which gives \\(k = 2\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n   - We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n   - The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n   - Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I should find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(b^2\\), which would be \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient I found earlier, 6, is already the final answer because when I multiply by the other expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just get multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) when expanded gives terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of these terms will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact with it. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a constant with respect to the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product will just be 6 times whatever the expansion of the \\(c\\) terms is. But wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a separate term, so when you multiply by the \\(c\\) terms, it's like each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because each term in the product would have the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a sum, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I have two separate expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. \n\nBut wait, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expression would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expression), which would be 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check this again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be interpreted differently. Maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to 1. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it might be 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nHowever, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that all \\(c\\) terms are included. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because when you have separate variables, the coefficients shouldn't interfere with each other. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. \n\nIn this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would simply be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 2. Alternatively, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 0 because \\((c + 1/c)\\) has terms \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), no constant term. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, but if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), it's 0. So, depending on how the question is phrased, it's important whether it's asking for the coefficient regardless of other variables or specifically including them. \n\nIn our original problem, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in that case, I think it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum over all \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer would be 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, for the \\(c\\) terms, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\).

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms are in another.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable.

But that seems a bit confusing because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) part is separate. Wait, but in the product, each term would be a combination, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question, and it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficients, which gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you write the product, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6 because the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. But I think that's not the case because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the same as the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from the first part) multiplied by 2 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

I need to consider this part as well, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but this part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't directly affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it just involves \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression as a product, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit tricky because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384?

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term from the second expansion, but that would result in multiple terms involving \\(c\\), not just a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is a product, so each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems more likely.\n\nBut let me try to approach it differently. Let's expand both parts separately and see how they interact. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The term we're interested in is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), which it doesn't specify, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).\n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut let me make sure. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion can be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, which is 1 * 2 = 2, which is the same as 1 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, yes, in this smaller example, the coefficient of each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of its coefficients is indeed 2^6 = 64, as when c=1, it's (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients times the sum of the coefficients in the other variable. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, if I think of the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is involved. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem. As I did earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another term, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, I think I can handle each part separately and then multiply them together. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Or do I? Hmm, maybe I do, because when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms could combine in different ways. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it can only come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), any term multiplied by it will still have the \\(c\\) part. So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product equal to the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, maybe that's the case.\n\nLet me test this idea. Let's say I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for a term in \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P(a, b)\\) and multiplying it by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). That makes sense because when you multiply, each term from \\(P\\) is scaled by each term from \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) is scaled by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nSo, applying this to the problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nNow, multiplying the two results together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Another way to think about this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I'm looking for a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, this term can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Each of these would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term. However, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum of all these contributions. But wait, that's the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other expansion, because each term in the other expansion has a coefficient that gets multiplied by the 6 from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients and powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each of those terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, yes, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so that's correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and evaluate the sum of coefficients.\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\).

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part of the product, when I multiply it by the second part, it will get multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, let me think again. Actually, no, when I multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the multiplication by the second expansion will just add factors involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself will be multiplied by the entire expansion. However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient, not the variables. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. However, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). That means that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the variables (involving \\(c\\)) don't affect it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, so how does that affect the coefficient? \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that's not possible because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once in the product, specifically as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Wait, no, because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless there's a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), the product won't have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) exponents. That is, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms from the second expansion)}\\). So, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because the second expansion isn't a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), we just need the part of the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. When you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's equivalent to multiplying by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is indeed 6, as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire second expansion is? But that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would affect the overall expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the question asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what the \\(c\\) terms are. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But again, that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That changes things. So, I need to consider both expansions and find the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. \n\nAlright, let's approach this step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which we already determined is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's work on that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponent, that's \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, there are other terms involving \\(c\\). So, if I'm only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then yes, the coefficient is 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be different because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, leading to a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out, hence the \\(c^0\\) term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me just double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the question is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the multiplication affects this term. \n\nLet me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I can actually treat them separately. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute some coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. But wait, does the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Let me clarify: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the terms are multiplied. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^mc^{6 - m}\\) where \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would be the middle term when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(c^3 \\times c^{-3} = c^0\\). \n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so unless we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is about the coefficient in the product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have a coefficient that is 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we're supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) has exponent zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, let's proceed with that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply the two coefficients together.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part? Actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since the variables are different, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent, but we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed 6. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire product is a polynomial where each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m} \\times c^{6 - m}\\) or something like that. Hmm, maybe not. I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Calculating those gives 6 and 20, respectively, so the final coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We look for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term from the second part contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^{-2}\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be, because each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since every term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if we're just considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would effectively be multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me check that.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the product. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m - 6}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, the exponents in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are such that each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes the product of the two coefficients, and the \\(c\\) part is just along for the ride. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum over all the possible coefficients from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} \\right)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), as I thought earlier. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384. Let's see. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 times each coefficient in the second part, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions. But wait, actually, no. Because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try a smaller example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from ac and a/c), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 1 + 1 = 2. So, according to my method, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, which matches because in the product, the terms are ac and a/c, each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because the terms are bc and b/c, each with coefficient 1. So, this seems to work.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, the terms are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2, so in the product, it would be 2 * 2 = 4. Checking, the terms are \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab / c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 4. Correct again.\n\nSo, this approach seems valid. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and see if I can find the coefficient another way. For example, perhaps using generating functions or considering the exponents.\n\nWait, another thought: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these coefficients, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is what I did.\n\nWait, but let me check the second part again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me try to compute the product more directly. Let's expand both parts separately.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that:\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. \n\nLet me think: When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the first part, so when I multiply it by the entire second part, I might end up with terms that have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), right? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no, because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only concerned with how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but the variables are different. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each multiplication would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it? Because each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + E\\), where A is \\(a^4\\), B is \\(4a^3b\\), C is \\(6a^2b^2\\), D is \\(4ab^3\\), and E is \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = F + G + H + ...\\), each term in the product will be a combination of terms from A, B, C, D, E multiplied by terms from F, G, H, etc. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from C, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply C by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or anything else. Wait, but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't a term unless the power of \\(c\\) is zero? \n\nWait, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, unless \\(k = 0\\), you won't have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nWait, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a binomial expansion. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when I multiply by the \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20. So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) of 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're effectively looking for the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nBut no, that can't be right because if I just take the entire second part, it's a sum of terms with \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. \n\nSo, I think my initial reasoning was correct: the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I haven't missed anything. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part to give \\(a^2b^2\\).\n4. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in that reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat these two parts as independent? \n\nWait, let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part can be considered as a constant in this context? Hmm, that might be the case because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and their exponents don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nLet me test this idea. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can treat the entire second expansion as a single constant term when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Because if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and sum their coefficients, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems complicated because the second expansion has multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I need to check the exact wording again. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\)? \n\nHmm, I think it's the latter. Because if I were to consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible terms in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the question is phrased as asking for a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. If I have two separate products, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term in the first product is multiplied by each term in the second product. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. That suggests that perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify which power. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and thus the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of multiple variables, you might be expected to consider the entire product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the constant term, which is the middle term when expanding. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 times the constant term of the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I might need to clarify. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that I can treat the second expansion as a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is not a constant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems complicated. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. Since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a single coefficient; it's an expansion with multiple terms. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate products. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, because the sum of coefficients is 64, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), not 6 times 64. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but the second part doesn't have a single coefficient; it's an expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is another variable. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to find all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would involve the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because the coefficient should be a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). \n\nSimplifying the exponent of \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), which can be any even number depending on \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\), and the coefficient for each such term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So,"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by looking at \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient of that term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, looking at the entire expression, we have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the two parts separately. \n\nThat means, as I thought earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the constant term (the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. Each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). \n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\(-2k = -6\\)\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me just verify that again. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is of the form:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (the constant term). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, and the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that calculation seems off. Let me compute it again:\n\n6! = 720\n\n3! = 6\n\nSo, 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to multiply the coefficients we found from each part. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term (in \\(c\\)) in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), we would have to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so the total coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to ensure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, so \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole thing, I need to consider how the terms multiply. \n\nLet me think. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the first part \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll still have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and sum their coefficients multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the second part as a sum of coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, that might not be the case. Let me think again. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying that, the term becomes \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). \n\nBut we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, we need to consider all possible values of \\(m\\) such that \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is a term in the expansion, but since the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is present in a specific way, but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut that sum is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that some terms in the second expansion could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), changes the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? No, because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just adds a coefficient, and the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remains 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it just adds the coefficients. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another thought: is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it's just the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion, when multiplied, adds a factor of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The first part has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 1 (since \\((a + b)^2\\) has \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present; wait, actually, \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe my example is bad. Let me choose a better one. \n\nLet me take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). The second part, \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), has coefficients 1, 2, 1 for \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), and \\(c^{-2}\\). The sum of coefficients is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 * 4 = 12. \n\nBut let's actually expand it:\n\n\\((a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3) \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nLooking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\), which is 3 in the first part. Then, when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes 3c^2 + 6 + 3/c^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3 times (1 + 2 + 1) = 3 * 4 = 12, which matches. \n\nSo, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3 * 4 = 12. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, the term \\(a^2b\\) is present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient gets multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the example. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first expansion is \\(a + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But when we expand it, we get \\(a c + a /c + b c + b /c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, as \\(a c\\) and \\(a /c\\) both have coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2. So, that works. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Expanding, we have \\(a^2c^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2a^2 + 2ab c + 2ab /c + b^2c^2 + b^2/c^2 + 2b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2 (from \\(a^2c^2\\) and \\(a^2/c^2\\)) plus 2 (from the middle terms), so total 4. That matches. \n\nSo, yes, the logic seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients is the value when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches. So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the sum of coefficients as the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a different approach. Wait, no, the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so it's the same as evaluating at \\(c = 1\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be affected by the second expansion in a way that changes its coefficient? For example, if the second expansion had terms with negative exponents, would that affect the coefficient? No, because the coefficient is a scalar; it doesn't depend on the exponent of \\(c\\). So, each term in the second expansion just adds its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts fully and multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, after considering multiple ways"

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that expansion out. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the terms will be from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients. Now, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is that the entire expression is multiplied by another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I just found, 6, is multiplied by something from this second expansion. But wait, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the terms from the second expansion will just contribute a factor that gets multiplied by the 6. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient I'm looking for is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would then have terms involving \\(c\\), but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and sum their coefficients. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(6 \\times \\text{(each term in the second expansion)}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number but a combination of coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because usually, coefficients are constants. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since the second part is multiplied by the first, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might not be asking for that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's actually a single term, and the variables are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible because coefficients are scalars. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or just \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, so that doesn't make sense. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) or something else, but as it stands, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nLet me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I correctly identified that to get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I needed the constant term from the second expansion, which I found to be 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. \n\nYes, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient of 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) just gets multiplied as a whole. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so I might need to consider the entire expansion.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form (term from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times (term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that the \\(c\\) terms are being treated as constants or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). That seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let's consider the expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. But wait, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's correct that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times (something). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to approach this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's like treating the second polynomial as a single term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make sense if we're looking for a specific term. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, does it mean regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out? Hmm, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, it's usually considering all possible exponents for the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but I think that's unlikely. More likely, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. But earlier, I considered the possibility that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for both interpretations and see which one makes sense. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6})\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 36 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, perhaps it's expecting the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 120. That would make sense because the problem might be implicitly considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving just a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so it's ambiguous. However, in many math problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they usually mean the coefficient when all other variables are considered, which in this case would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to see if I can find any clues in the problem statement. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\"

Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially multiplying it by the entire expansion of that part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply by \\(c^0\\), the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. \n\nLet me make sure I'm thinking correctly. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part, when expanded, has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but not a constant term. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nHmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms is if you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. \n\nSo, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). \n\nCalculating that: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part gives a constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) of 20. When I multiply these together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0 because we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can compute the entire product and see if that makes sense. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) first. \n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The expansion is:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6(1/c)^0 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5(1/c)^1 = 6 \\times c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4(1/c)^2 = 15 \\times c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3(1/c)^3 = 20 \\times c^0 = 20\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^2(1/c)^4 = 15 \\times c^{-2} = 15/c^2\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^1(1/c)^5 = 6 \\times c^{-4} = 6/c^4\\)\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^0(1/c)^6 = 1 \\times c^{-6} = 1/c^6\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion above. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20a^2b^2\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, only the term where we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20 (the constant term) will give us \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think if there's another approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product as a whole. \n\nAlternatively, since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, as I did earlier. So, that seems consistent. \n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) that makes \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nWait, what's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\)? I think it's calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4-2)!}\\). Let me compute that: \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this term comes from the first part, I need to consider how the second part affects it. But wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nHowever, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because there's no overlap in variables to affect the coefficient. \n\nWait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different part of the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion's sum of coefficients because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get 6 times the coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes 6 times that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficients from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because the second part is a separate variable. So, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to some power, but the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these coefficients, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient}_k \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the second expansion has terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Now, when I multiply the first expansion by the second expansion, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But wait, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms with \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes 6 times that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is a separate polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, it must be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero, i.e., the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes more sense.

So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120. \n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\n2. Now, consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, set the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero. \n\n3. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\n4. Set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\n5. The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n6. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficient for this term: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the other part.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think I'm supposed to consider the entire product, but only the part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the variables from each expression are multiplied together. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by terms from the second part that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check: the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all terms have either positive or negative powers of \\(c\\). So, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to be multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is if we take the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. \n\nWait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, I need to find two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I get 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me go through it again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about setting \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which gave me 64, but that approach was wrong because it's not about the sum of coefficients, but rather about the specific term that cancels out the \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the constant term is.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent equal to 0: 6 - 2k = 0 \u2192 k = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by every term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), none of those terms affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial will give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about setting \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which gave me 64, and then 6 * 64 = 384, but that approach was wrong because it's not about the sum of coefficients, but rather about the specific term that gives \\(c^0\\). So, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nLet me set up the equation for that. If I have \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and I want \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term I'm interested in is when \\(k = 2\\).

Hmm, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, I think, that I don't need to worry about the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nLet me make sure I understand. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply this by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains the same as in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying by the other expansion. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the expansion of the first part. \n\nSo, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion, but maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think again. \n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, variables in different polynomials don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. \n\nSuppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\text{something} \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{something else} \\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a sum of terms, not a single term. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. \n\nIn this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), none of those terms will affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but that's still a polynomial. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the question is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That means, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would result in a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut how do you get the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial? The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all its coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part? \n\nYes, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if you want the coefficient of that specific term in the product, regardless of the other variables, you have to multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Suppose I expand both polynomials separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me just verify this with a different approach. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, as before, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just confirm with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nExpanding it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2 (from \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\)), so that checks out. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. \n\nSo, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That means, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, which suggests that perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire coefficient, including the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(6 - m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. \n\nBut in the initial problem, the user wrote: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c+\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nBut let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a term that is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable and is asking"

    "text": " \n\nSince the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), let me expand that first. Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to find the value of \\(k\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me set up the exponents: \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply them together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression, effectively just scaling it. \n\nBut wait, no, actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, you have terms from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) depending on the term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and then summing their coefficients. \n\nBut in that case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, if we treat \\(c\\) as another variable, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nThus, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Hmm, so does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I have to consider something else?\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, I'll have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, you're considering specific terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because then you're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all specified.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's tackle that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k\\) to be zero. Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) which implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

But that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, I think the more reasonable interpretation is that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).
