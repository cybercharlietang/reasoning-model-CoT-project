    "text": " So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct. Because the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term as a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a sum, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, giving 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times whatever is in the other part. But I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not involving \\(c\\). Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can combine to give \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to consider both parts: the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier when I thought the coefficient was 384. Actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression also involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120. That seems correct. Let me verify this by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. I must have made a mistake in my first approach. Let me clarify: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms from the second expression. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But that's not correct because the problem is about a specific term, not the entire coefficient. Wait, no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts the other approach where I considered \\(c^0\\). I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If it's the former, then it's 384; if it's the latter, it's 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems counterintuitive because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expression, but when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expression has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6 times 20, which is 120. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I think the standard interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the answer would be 120. To confirm, let me think about how the product works. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. When you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20a^2b^2\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is only the term where \\(c^0\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. I think my initial confusion was about whether the problem wanted the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically the \\(c^0\\) term. Given that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more likely that it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve the product of the two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expansion. So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from my earlier thought. So, which one is correct? I think the second approach is correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire product, would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second. The term where \\(c^0\\) is the only one that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\) which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But in this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), which are variables, so they don't combine with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, it's a polynomial. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of the product. So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then that would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, that's similar to what I thought before. Let me clarify: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is a constant term. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which are variables, and the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term without \\(c\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\). So, let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so it must be multiplied by the constant term from the second part.

So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term with \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term 20. Since these are multiplied together, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yeah, I think 120 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Next, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds all those contributions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^n = 2^n\\). So, in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).

Wait, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are exactly 2 and 2, respectively, and any exponent for \\(c\\). Wait, but no, in the original problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). So, actually, I think the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, when multiplied by the second part, it's just \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so I think I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is just multiplied by 1? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. I think I need to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me try another way. Maybe I should first expand both parts separately and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the terms will involve both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find that? Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems too simplistic. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, so when you multiply by the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find that? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. But that expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). Now, if I multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), then each of these coefficients would be multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(2c + 2/c\\). So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and for \\(a^1b^1\\), it would be \\(2c + 2/c\\). But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the first part is 6, and then multiplied by the entire second expression, so the coefficient would be \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is 6, as we found earlier. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term occurs at \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I only need to consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that's the only term that won't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply these two, you get the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by 1 (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), so the coefficient remains the same. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\).

But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is to consider the product of these two expressions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a very large expression. That doesn't seem right either. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms with \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value, not involving \\(c\\). So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times 20, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the constant term from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, only the constant term in the second part (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). All other terms would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. 2. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 3. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. 4. Find the constant term, which is 20. 5. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the final coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be the same regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Let me see. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), meaning that for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe the first interpretation is correct. However, in many problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it's often implied that those other variables should have zero exponent. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm a bit unsure because often when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's with respect to all variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting 120 because it's more about the combined term, considering \\(c\\). Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct if we're evaluating at \\(c = 1\\), but perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, considering all terms, so 384 is the answer.\n\nWait, but when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since it's not specified, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think of the coefficient of a term in a product, it's usually with respect to all variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, I get \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in the problem, we're dealing with exponents, so perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable and considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a number. So, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the small example I did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, but in the given problem, the answer is 120 because it's specifically looking for the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the coefficient is a numerical coefficient, so it's expecting 120. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see what the problem is asking for. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, but that seems too large, and in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for each"

Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part can be any term, but when multiplied together, the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a scalar coefficient. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum involving \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole.

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expression has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expression, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expression. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms. But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, you're just scaling the entire first part by the expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that's not correct because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in the first polynomial, multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, what is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6*64=384. But wait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Wait, that's a different approach. So, maybe I was wrong before. Let me clarify: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms in the product where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, that's not possible because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it. So, as I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6*20=120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. Now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible. Let me check: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. But if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that it's considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, which would be 120. To resolve this, let me consider the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning 384. But I'm not entirely certain. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems confusing. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's denote the first part as \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expressions together, every term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\) (since the coefficient is 6). Now, when this is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not exactly right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes \\(6a^2b^2\\) times their respective coefficients and their respective powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients, since each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let me compute that. Substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6.

So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied together. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the second part just contributes a factor that's independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, maybe we can consider that any term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the second part isn't a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expression, you get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expression. Wait, that makes sense. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that term. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so that's the answer? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part, because any other term from the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first expansion, it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right either. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(c^k \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Once we find that, we can multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6, and that will give us the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're only considering the constant term in the second expansion?

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in the expansion would be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it would be multiplied by each term from the second part.

Wait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by 1 from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent cancels out, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Oh, maybe the problem is considering all variables together, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and any term in the product would have powers of \\(c\\) as well. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and wants the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0 = 1\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that. So, if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. That seems plausible. So, let's proceed with that. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering all variables, specifically when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To get \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied by 1 when considering \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded, then each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) terms are not involved. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and without knowing the power of \\(c\\), it's unclear. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) terms as separate and just focus on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is present. Wait, that might make sense. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products where the terms from the first expansion contribute \\(a^2b^2\\) and the terms from the second expansion contribute a constant term. But in this case, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.

Wait, but let me double-check that.

That seems right. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will multiply each term in that expansion by \\(a^2b^2\\).

We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe I do need to consider the entire expansion because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one gets multiplied by each term in the other. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms can be treated separately. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, which is 6a^2b^2. Then, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need to see what the coefficient is for the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering both \\(a, b, c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and the \\(c\\) parts are multiplied in, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by something, if that something includes a term with \\(c^0\\), then that term will be 6 times that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 2m = 6 \u21d2 m = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me check that again. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when m=3, so that's correct, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
