Wait, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the coefficients. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term can only come from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the \\(c\\) terms would make the product have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that logic. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something that includes \\(c\\) terms, then the resulting terms would have \\(c\\) in them, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself doesn't have \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the \\(c\\) part is 1, meaning the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6*20=120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in terms where the result is \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, but wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's only the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which comes from the first part, the second part must contribute a term that's a constant, i.e., a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(c\\) terms must multiply to give \\(c^0\\). So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only be present if there's a \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial. Wait, that's a different approach. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because only then would \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's a better approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense. So, let's do that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems more reasonable. Let me confirm. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the coefficient is from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when considering terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here.

    "text": " So, maybe I can just focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and the other part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the other part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, the second part can be anything, but since we're only considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too big. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum, not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you get a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial will multiply it, but since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), which doesn't appear in \\(a^2b^2\\), every term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check by considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I had before. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first times the sum of all coefficients in the second. Because each term in the second can be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) without affecting the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would it result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient is just the 6 from the first part. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Is there any interaction between the two parts that could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial multiply, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no. Actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only looking at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part contributes a scalar multiple (the constant term), so the coefficient is just 6 times 20, which is 120.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{k}\\) for some exponent \\(k\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion's coefficients are tied to specific \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually considering the entire expansion, and looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve any \\(c\\) terms.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's the case because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts here.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has multiple terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, which has a coefficient of 6, and multiply it by each term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's the same as 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second polynomial is multiplied as a whole, so each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384, as before. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. But the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible combinations with \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), each term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears would have a coefficient equal to the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient from the second part. So, the total coefficient would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that's not correct because each term in the second part has a different coefficient, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular \\(c\\) term, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6, because each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied together.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a two-variable expression. The first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and the second part would contribute any term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) instead of \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). Because otherwise, the variables are separate, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms wouldn't affect it. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable.\n\nLet me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of coefficients in the second part being 64, which would lead to 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's only considering the constant term, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's consistent with my earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me just recap. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, I first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the first part has only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these terms will contribute to the overall product, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? I think the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) really 64? Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms are like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term like \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them together, you get terms like \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, we can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's the term from \\((a + b)^4\\). But in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, any term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) would be when the exponent is zero. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. So, we can find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's the coefficient when considering all terms, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the expansion, it would be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that would result in a term without \\(c\\) is when you multiply by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. I think that's correct. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as expanding both parts and looking for the specific term. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). The constant term is indeed 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the product as two separate parts: the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part involving \\(c\\). The \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and the second part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, again, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant. Alternatively, if the constant term is 1, then the coefficient would just be 6. Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we just need to consider the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)), because multiplying by that term will leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as is, without any \\(c\\) terms. If we multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would involve \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are present, and not \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, you'll end up with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in the product, which would change the term we're looking for. So, that's another way to see that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can actually compute the entire expansion or at least check if the constant term is indeed 20. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the exponent to be zero, 6 - 2m = 0, so m = 3. Then, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20. So, that's why when we multiply by 6, we get 120.\n\nWait another thought: is there any possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other terms in the expansion when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\)? For example, if I have a term with \\(c\\) and another term with \\(1/c\\), maybe they multiply to 1, but then I have other terms in the expansion. But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part must contribute the constant term to not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, summarizing: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expression because each multiplication by a term in the second expression will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be the original coefficient times the sum of coefficients from the second expression. Alternatively, since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1, so if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression contributes to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I think of it as the product of the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that term, times the coefficients in the second polynomial. But in this case, since the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for all combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial has terms like \\(c^k\\), each term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because otherwise, if you multiply by \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because only then would the product result in a term \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, let me recast this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial has a coefficient of 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term. Let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second polynomial is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by 20, resulting in a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Hmm, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part), giving 120. So, I think I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 384; that would be the case if we were considering the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, but actually, we only want the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me double-check this. So, in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Yes, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

So, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which would give me the sum of the coefficients.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that seems to make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. So, yes, that would mean 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me try a different approach. Let's expand both parts separately and see what happens. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up, but in this case, we're looking for a specific term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not exactly right because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product would be something like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I feel like that's not the right approach because the problem might be expecting me to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but no, because the second expansion is multiplied by the entire first expansion, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Let me expand both parts separately and see what happens. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that some terms might cancel out or something? I don't think so because all the coefficients in the second expansion are positive, so when multiplied by 6, they just add up. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is the product of both expressions. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term from the second part that's a constant, i.e., a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term, so when I multiply them, I get 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would involve the coefficients from both expansions. But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, we're effectively treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because for each \\(a^2b^2\\) term, you can pair it with any term from the second expansion, and since we're just looking for the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the product of the coefficients. Wait, but no, that's not correct because the second expansion's terms have variables \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier answer of 120. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the entire expansion, considering all variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, which is 6 * 20, where 20 is the constant term in the second expansion. So, which is correct? Let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand the entire expression. Each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Then, for each such term, we multiply by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each with a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, considering only the constant term. So, which is correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (constant term) is 6 * 20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients where the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's see, 6+36=42, 42+90=132, 132+120=252, 252+90=342, 342+36=378, 378+6=384. So, that's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. So, which is it? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, then it's 120. So, which interpretation is correct? I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is also present, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate. Wait, maybe I should look at it another way. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, the exponent on \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). So, it depends on what exactly the problem is asking. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the context of polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it usually refers to the term with that exact combination of variables, regardless of other variables. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, but that can't be right because the second expansion also contributes. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning summing over all \\(c\\) terms, it's 384. But usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the entire expression, considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 120 because it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only the constant term from the second expansion. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. My initial confusion was whether to consider the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it refers to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n"

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)) in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is 20.

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, actually, when I multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, or perhaps it's just that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has a term with coefficient 20 for \\(c^0\\), so indeed, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, that seems too simple. Let me check again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and those terms don't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that's just 1 (since \\(c^0\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms would affect the exponent). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, for the term that's \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient for the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by the constant term in the other expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, I think 120 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which don't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would be the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives 20 as the constant term. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, does that make sense? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a constant term 20 from the second part, then when I multiply them, I get \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is indeed 20 * 6 = 120. I think that's correct. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
