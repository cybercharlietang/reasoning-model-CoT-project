    "text": " So, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term.

Wait, let me just double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient should be 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me go through it again quickly. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the constant term with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, but wait, is there any other way this could be affected? For example, could there be other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), give another term with \\(a^2b^2\\) but a different power of \\(c\\)? But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.
