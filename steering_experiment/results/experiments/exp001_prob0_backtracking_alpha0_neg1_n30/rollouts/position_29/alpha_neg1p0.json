We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake in the exponents when expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), which is correct.

So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
